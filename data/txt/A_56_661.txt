Financing of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea

Budget for the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea for the period from 1 July 2001 to
30 June 2002

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the
Secretary-General on the budget for the United Nations
Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) for the
period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (A/56/610).
During its consideration of the report, the Committee
met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information.

2. The Security Council established UNMEE by its
resolution 1312 (2000) of 31 July 2000, for an initial
period of six months, with effect from 31 July 2000. In
paragraph 2 of its resolution 1320 (2000) of 15
September 2000, the Security Council extended the
mandate of the Mission until 15 March 2001 and
authorized the deployment within UNMEE of up to
4,200 troops, including up to 220 military observers.
Subsequently, in its resolution 1369 (2001) of 14
September 2001, the Security Council decided to
extend the mandate of UNMEE until 15 March 2002 at
the troop and military observer levels authorized by its
resolution 1320 (2000).

3. The Advisory Committee recalls that the
Controller, in his letter dated 22 March 2001, informed
the Committee that recent and prospective anticipated
developments specific to certain peacekeeping

missions (including UNMEE), would likely affect their
mandates, operational concepts, scope and scale of
activities and related resource requirements. The
Controller, therefore, requested that the Committee
recommend to the General Assembly, as an interim
measure, the granting of commitment authorization
with assessment in the amount of $90 million gross for
the maintenance of UNMEE for the period from 1 July
to 31 December 2001, pending submission of the
detailed UNMEE budget to the General Assembly at its
fifty-sixth session.

4. On the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee (see A/55/874, para. 10 (b)), the General
Assembly, in its resolution 55/252 B of 14 June 2001,
authorized the Secretary-General to enter into
commitments in the amount of $90 million gross for
the maintenance of UNMEE for the period from 1 July
to 31 December 2001, and decided that that amount
should be assessed on Member States. In the same
resolution, the Assembly appropriated and assessed the
amount of $5.4 million gross for the support account
for peacekeeping operations and the amount of
$568,706 gross for the United Nations Logistics Base
at Brindisi, representing the pro-rated share of the
Mission in the support account and the Logistics Base

A/56/661

requirements for the period from 1 July 2001 to
30 June 2002.

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that
amounts totalling $234.7 million had been assessed on
Member States in respect of UNMEE since its
inception to 31 December 2001 and that contributions
received at 31 October 2001 totalled $128.4 million.
Outstanding balances amounted to $106.3 million.

6. The cash balances of UNMEE amounted to $75.9
million at 5 November 2001. The Advisory Committee
was informed that troop-contributing countries had
received payments totalling $10,621,902 for the period
from 14 October 2000 to 31 March 2001, and that an
estimated amount of $24,753,746 was still due for the
period from 1 April to 30 September 2001. The
Committee was also informed that reimbursement to
troop-contributing Member States covering the months
of April to September 2001 was expected to be made
by the end of the year, subject to the availability of
cash.

7. The proposed budget for UNMEE for the period
from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 amounts to
$208,879,800 gross ($204,969,700 net), exclusive of
budgeted voluntary contributions in kind amounting to
$200,000. As reflected in annex I to the budget
document, no provision is made for the support
account. The Committee sought clarification on
procedures to be followed in budgeting for additional
support account requirements related to UNMEE and
was informed that it was the intention of the Secretary-
General, based on such decision as the General
Assembly might take regarding the additional resources
under the support account for peacekeeping operations,
to prorate the financing of the additional approved
resources for the support account among the missions
whose updated budgets would be considered during the
fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly: United
Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), UNMEE,
United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and
United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET).

8. As indicated in paragraph 6 of the proposed
budget, the estimated requirements for the period from
1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 represent a 16 per cent
increase in total resources (gross) in relation to the
apportionment for the financial period 2000/01. The

Committee notes from table 1 of the report that the
total increase of 16 per cent reflects a 79.7 per cent
increase in military personnel costs, a 71.6 per cent
increase in civilian personnel costs, a 39.9 per cent
decrease in operational costs, a 78.6 per cent increase
in other programmes and an 83.3 per cent increase in
staff assessment.

9. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon
enquiry, that estimated expenditures for the period
from 1 July to 31 December 2001 amounted to $51.3
million at 31 October 2001, leaving an unspent balance
of $38.6 million, compared with the apportionment of
$90.0 million. The Committee was also informed that
the total of $51.3 million included $33.0 million in
unliquidated obligations and $1.7 million in pre-
encumbrances. The Committee observes in this
connection that the significant level of unliquidated
obligations and pre-encumbrances, which represent
two thirds of the estimated expenditure of $51.3
million, may indicate that funds would not be
ultimately disbursed in their totality. Furthermore,
the Committee was informed that expenditures for the
financial period ended 30 June 2001 amounted to
$156.3 million, leaving an unspent balance of $23.7
million, or 15 per cent of the apportionment of $180
million.

10. The proposed 2001/02 budget for UNMEE
provides for the deployment of military contingents of
up to 3,980 troops, 220 military observers, supported
by substantive offices comprising 71 international and
24 local staff and 10 United Nations Volunteers and an
administrative component comprising 186 international
and 250 local staff and 72 United Nations Volunteers.
As shown in tables 1 and 2 of annex I.C to the budget
document, the full deployment of the authorized level
of 3,980 troops and 220 military observers is projected
for the month of November 2001.

11. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
incumbency situation of UNMEE at 31 October 2001
was as follows:

Category of personnel

level Encumbered

International staff 282 220 22.0

Local staff 322 247 23.3

United Nations
Volunteers 15 14 6.7

12. As indicated in paragraph 17 of the Secretary-
General’s report, the proposed budget includes
resources to continue to provide for the core Mine
Action Coordination Centre staff and equipment to
enable it effectively to carry out its coordination role,
technical advice and information management for mine
action in the temporary security zone. The proposed
budget reflects also the conversion of 20 posts (1 P-5,
3 P-4, 7 P-3, 1 General Service and 8 local level) of the
Centre into non-post resources budgeted under
contractual services. The Committee was informed that
the related contractual services would be provided
through the United Nations Office for Project Services
(UNOPS).

13. The proposed budget includes also a provision of
$585,900 for quick-impact projects, representing re-
programming of projects delayed from 2000/01. The
Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 18 of the
budget document that owing to the delayed
establishment of the temporary security zone, only
$32,203 was expended during the financial period
2000/01 out of the budgeted provision of $700,000 for
quick-impact projects. Annex I to the present
document, provided by the Secretariat, contains an
updated list of quick-impact projects at 6 November
2001, indicating the status and the expected completion
date.

14. The Advisory Committee notes with concern
that no progress has been made in the
implementation of its recommendation to establish
a direct flight link between Addis Ababa and
Asmara (see annex V to the budget document).
According to the Mission, the additional cost caused
by the absence of such a link, amounted to $0.9
million for the period from 23 August 2000 to 30
June 2001 and is estimated at $1.0 million for the
period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002.

15. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in
paragraph 6 of its resolution 1320 (2000), the
Security Council requested the Governments of
Ethiopia and Eritrea to conclude, as necessary,
status-of-forces agreements with the Secretary-
General within 30 days of the adoption of that
resolution, and recalls that, pending the conclusion
of such agreements, the model status-of-forces
agreement of 9 October 1990 (A/45/594) should
apply provisionally. The Committee was informed
that a status-of-forces agreement remained yet to be
signed with the Government of Eritrea. According to
the mission, taxes paid by UNMEE to the Government
of Eritrea under protest for the period from January to
September 2001 amounted to $167,100.

16. The Advisory Committee welcomes the fact
that in response to its recommendations (see
A/55/688/Add.1, para. 31), the Mission proposes to
increase the number of United Nations Volunteer
positions, including through conversion of 17
international Professional posts and 24 local level
posts into United Nations Volunteer positions. As
indicated in paragraph 34 of the budget document,
compared with the staffing establishment for the
financial period 2000/01, the proposed staffing reflects
a reduction of 25 international staff (1 P-5, 2 P-4, 7
P-3, 5 General Service/Other level and 10 Field
Service) and 48 local level staff and an increase of 67
United Nations Volunteer positions. The Committee
notes that 10 Volunteers would be assigned to
substantive areas (4 in the Public Information Office, 2
in the Human Rights Office and 4 in the Political
Affairs Office) and 72 United Nations Volunteers
would be used in administrative areas.

17. The Advisory Committee regrets the lack of
clarity in the explanation of staffing requirements
for UNMEE. For example, the proposed budget for the
Mission (see A/56/610, para. 21) refers to a proposed
conversion of 40 local posts into 24 United Nations
Volunteer positions, while the Secretariat clarified
upon enquiry that only 24 local level posts would be
converted into 24 Volunteer positions. Moreover, while
paragraph 37 (a) of the same document includes a
proposal to abolish a total of 30 substantive posts, the
explanation in the text of the paragraph refers to the
abolition of 32 posts and internal redeployment of 3
posts. Similarly, although paragraph 37 (b) includes a
proposal to increase a total of 15 substantive posts, the
explanation in the paragraph refers to the increase of



4
A/56/661

2 posts and 10 United Nations Volunteer positions and
internal redeployment of 3 posts. The table below,
which was prepared by the Secretariat upon request,
clarifies the staffing changes for UNMEE:

The Advisory Committee has no objection to the
proposed staffing establishment of UNMEE.

18. The Advisory Committee stresses that
additional measures need to be taken both by the
administration of the Mission and by the
management of peacekeeping operations at
Headquarters in order to improve presentation of
staffing requirements in budget documents for
peacekeeping operations to conform to the United
Nations budgetary norms and procedures (see also
the Committee’s comments in its report on
UNAMSIL, A/56/621, paras. 22-24).

19. The Advisory Committee was informed by
representatives of the Secretary-General of the positive
impact of United Nations Volunteers on the activities
of the Mission and of the good cooperation that the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General had
established with United Nations agencies, funds and
programmes present in the area of operation. The
Committee requests in this connection that the next
budget submission for UNMEE include information

on such cooperation and possible future role for
United Nations Volunteers, as well as statistics on
human rights issues.

20. As indicated in paragraph 4 of annex I.C to the
budget document, the estimated requirements of
$67,876,100 under military contingents provide for
standard troop cost reimbursement for 46,546 person-
months, as well as rations, including bottled water and
a 16-day reserve. The Advisory Committee was
informed that the provision for military contingents
reflects significant economies resulting from the
installation of water purification and bottling plants in
UNMEE at 1 November 2001. According to the
Secretariat, the annual savings resulting from the
installation of water plants are estimated at
$0.9 million.

21. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 4
of annex I.C to the budget document that the meal
portion of the mission subsistence allowance for 126
force headquarters staff officers was discontinued
effective 15 October 2001. The Committee points out,
however, that countries contributing headquarters staff
officers receive reimbursement for their services at
standard rates regardless of whether or not the
headquarters staff officers come as part of military
contingents. The Committee was informed that the
issue of reimbursement to Governments for services of
headquarters staff officers is currently under review.

22. The Advisory Committee discussed the issue of
contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment with
representatives of the Secretary-General who clarified
that no systematic pre-deployment inspections were
undertaken. The Committee was informed, upon
enquiry, that items not reimbursable are identified
during verification process. The Committee was also
informed that military personnel of troop-contributing
countries participate in verification inspections for the
United Nations in addition to three UNMEE staff. The
Committee requests that the adequacy of the
verification capacity and arrangements of UNMEE
be examined (see also A/56/621, para. 20).

23. The Advisory Committee was provided upon
request with information on equipment and services
that were provided by the United Nations to military
contingents and included in the proposed budget for
2001/02 (see annex II to the present report).

24. A provision of $26,178,600 under air operations
covers a fleet of 12 helicopters and 7 fixed-wing



5
A/56/661

aircraft under long-term commercial and letter-of-assist
arrangements (see para. 17, annex I.C to the budget
document). The Advisory Committee notes from annex
II of the estimates that the fleet of helicopters and
fixed-wing aircraft has been augmented by three
additional helicopters (one MI-8 MTV-1 and two
B 212) and reduced from nine fixed-wing aircraft to
seven. The Committee raised questions as to the annual
cost and operational requirements for the eight-seat
light executive jet aircraft (HS-125-400B) used by the
Mission and was provided with additional information
(see annex III to the present document).

25. The Advisory Committee is not convinced of
the operational need for the executive jet, which is
used for an average monthly total of 26.17 hours,
although the Mission pays for 30 hours monthly, as
stipulated in the contract. Therefore, the Committee
requests that the contractual arrangements and the
use of the executive jet be reviewed with a view to
ascertaining its cost effectiveness and taking into
account the Committee’s recommendation on direct
flight (see para. 14 above). The Committee also
requests that the Mission explore less costly
alternatives to the executive jet.

26. The Advisory Committee received, upon request,
additional information on the Geographic Information
System (see annex IV below). As indicated in
paragraph 20 of the Secretary-General’s report
(A/56/610), the proposed budget provides for the
establishment of a Geographic Cell comprising three
International staff and three United Nations Volunteers
to conduct terrain studies and to collect, evaluate and
disseminate geographic information to UNMEE, the
field offices of United Nations agencies, non-
governmental organizations and the host countries. The
Committee was informed that the project is not yet
operational and personnel for it are under active
recruitment.

27. The Advisory Committee recalls that it had
requested that measures needed to be in place for
effective management and control of the assets of the
Mission (see A/55/688/Add.1, para. 40). The
Committee was informed that the field assets control
system was fully operational in UNMEE. The
Committee welcomes this development and trusts
that the Mission will ensure that information on
assets is regularly and consistently updated by
various services and that adequate staff is provided
for maintenance of the field assets control system.

On a related matter, the Committee expresses
concern that only two posts of resident auditors
(one P-4 and one General Service) out of four have
been filled as at time of the examination of the
estimates.

28. Taking into consideration the financial
performance during the period ended 30 June 2001
and the information on the pattern of expenditure
and commitments for the period from 1 July to
31 December 2001, as indicated in paragraph 9
above, the Advisory Committee recommends that
the General Assembly approve the appropriation
and assessment of the amount of $198.4 million
gross for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June
2002, inclusive of $90 million gross appropriated
and assessed by the General Assembly in its
resolution 55/252 B of 14 June 2001 for the period
from 1 July to 31 December 2001. Furthermore, the
Committee recommends monthly assessment for the
period from 16 March to 30 June 2002, should the
Security Council decide to extend the mandate of
UNMEE beyond 15 March 2002.

Annex III
Details of the annual cost and operational requirements of
the executive jet HS 125-400B
(United States dollars)

Breakdown of annual costs for the executive jet

Number of block hours 30
Price per hour $1 900
Number of extra hours 30
Price per hour $1 617
Insurance $4 000
Meals and accommodation $23 760
Maximum annual outlay $2 079 520
Maximum monthly outlay $173 293

Since its deployment in the Mission in January 2001, the executive jet has
been used for an average monthly total of 26.17 hours. The total flight hours for the
period up to October 2001 is 261.7 hours.

Contract: PD/C0003/01 Hawker Siddley 125-400B jet aircraft.
Registration: ZS-LME

Operational requirements

The jet is used by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the
Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Force Commander.
The jet is mainly for travel related to meetings in Addis Ababa and Asmara, which
is convened quite often on short notice. The flight time between Asmara and Addis
Ababa using the AN-26 is 3.75 hours, as the direct air corridor is not opened
between Eritrea and Ethiopia.  The executive jet reduces the flying time by nearly
50 per cent.

A/56/661

Annex IV
Details of geographic information system — a pilot project

A. Data processing equipment ($110,200)

1. This provision covers the cost of the following
items of computer hardware for the geographic
information system (GIS). This includes the GIS map
server, GIS workstations, notebook, PocketPC, full-
scale scanner, full-scale plotter, full-scale digitizer,
colour laserjet printer, digital camera, GPS receiver and
UPS.

B. Data processing software ($109,625)

2. This provision covers the cost of the following
items of GIS software, which allows for the collection,
analysis, maintenance and printing of geographic
information. This includes the following:

– ArcGIS-ArcInfo 8.1, ArcGIS-ArcEditor 8.1,
ArcGIS-ArcView 8.1, ArcView 3.2, image
analyst, spatial analyst, 3D analyst, Internet map
servers, etc.

C. Geographic information system
contractual staff ($141,000)

3. This provision covers the total emoluments for
the 2 GIS engineers for 6 months ($114,000), on
contractual arrangements to maintain and preserve the
data sensitivity. Since the data processed under this
project (temporary security zone, boundary of Ethiopia
and Eritrea, location of host nations troops,
peacekeeping forces, military operations and situation
monitoring, etc.) have high military and national
security issues involved, it is not considered
appropriate to use local staff to fill these posts.
Considering the delay occurred in the implementation
of the project, the GIS contractual staff salary and
allowances have been recalculated for the period of six
months, from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2002 as
follows:

(a) Salaries: $6,000 per month x 2 engineers x
6 months = $72,000

(b) Travel expenses for 2 engineers: $3,000 per
travel x 2 = $6,000

(c) Accommodation and meal allowance:
$3,000 per month-person x 2 x 6 months = $36,000.

4. Also it is proposed that, in the initial stage of
establishing GIS systems in the Mission, the work load
will be too high to be handled by the available staff
resources alone and hence the need for additional man
power (two experts for at least one month for a total
package of $27,000). The high workload is attributable
to the fact that UNMEE requires digital-based maps
that cannot be purchased or procured from any vendors
and therefore need to be created and kept updated by
the United Nations. Furthermore, high technical
support is necessary for setting up an Intranet-based
digital map server, GIS database management set up,
rectification of satellite imagery, vecterization, etc.

5. Given the above, one GIS professional expert and
one additional GIS engineer for a month each should
be required as indicated in annex III to document
A/55/839 (GIS support service, 6 engineer-months for
$49,500). Details of requirement are as follows:

(a) Salaries: $9,000 (expert) and $6,000
(engineer) x 2 x 1 month = $15,000

(b) Travel expenses for two persons: $3,000 per
travel x 2 = $6,000

(c) Accommodation and meal allowance:
$3,000 per month-person x 2 x 1 month = $6,000.

D. Geographic information system
training ($58,900)

6. The elaborate training programme covering
military as well as civilian personnel has been
necessitated by the fact that the GIS system is not only
designated for use by GIS staff, it is also meant to cater
to the multiple needs of a larger variety of users. One
of the key roles of GIS staff is to support the GIS
systems in its routine maintenance, updating and
installation of digital-based maps to be used by all
concerned who need geo-reference information for
daily operations and plans in the Mission and the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Therefore,
the GIS systems will be shared also among missions



14

A/56/661

included in the pilot project, MONUC, UNAMSIL and
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

7. In this regard, the GIS training and education
programme has been designed to cover not only the
Geographic Cell (GIS) staff of UNMEE but also
general users as well as of the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations staff (for system support).
Since GIS is a powerful tool for integrating and
analysing all source of geo-referenced data in diverse
areas, users of the GIS system will be key planners,
players and military staff in the Mission who will use
the system for their daily operations. Therefore,
although they are the main target trainees, in order to
establish, maintain and upgrade the GIS systems on a
continuous basis, GIS staff would also need extensive
training as well.

8. Training costs for the following courses will be
charged to UNMEE:

(a) For staff of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations ($14,000):

(i) On-site training in New York for ArcGIS-I
(basic GIS course, 2 days) up to 12 staff
members: $5,500;

(ii) On-site training in New York for
introduction of ArcIMS (3 days) up to 12 staff
members: $8,500;

(b) For UNMEE staff ($41,500), on-site
training at Asmara, for up to 12 Mission staff,
including per diem and travel for instructor:

(i) Two classes at one time, two each ArcGIS-I
(2 days) course (total 4 days) for up to 24 Mission
staff: $14,000

(ii) ArcGIS-II (3 days): $9,000;

(iii) Introduction of ArcIMS (3 days of classes):
$9,500;

(iv) Working with spatial analyst (3 days of
classes): $9,000;

(c) Training workbooks and other training
materials (i.e., books, supplies, etc.): $3,400.

E. Relationship with other missions —
MONUC and UNAMSIL

9. During the implementation stage in the
peacekeeping operations, the missions included under
this pilot project will keep in close contact and share
monitoring mechanisms to help each other deal with
any unexpected problems that normally happen with
implementation of any major complex systems like
GIS. This cooperation basically covers both technical
and conceptual areas of the project so that all the
missions will benefit from the sharing of issues,
solutions and the lessons learned.

10. Technical cooperation consists of the sharing of
official activities by military observers in various
functional areas, disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration operations, United Nations civilian police
activities and United Nations logistics to customize and
adapt the system to specific operational requirement so
that it allows the United Nations to fully utilize the
potential of the GIS.

11. Cooperation on a conceptual basis consists of the
sharing of issues between participating missions on the
chain of control, management, GIS data, classification
of data, dissemination parameters, accessibility
restrictions, responsibility with regard to preserving
confidentiality and security of data handled, surveying
etc.

F. Geographic information system pilot
project update

12. The following measures have been taken towards
the implementation of the GIS pilot project in the three
missions and the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations at Headquarters:

(a) The Department of Peacekeeping
Operations has recruited a new GIS officer;

(b) The operational concept of GIS is under
development (60 per cent). This covers the
development of a peacekeeping operations GIS
operational manual as a handbook. This process is
broken down into six functional areas, as follows:

(i) Gathering related data and planning;

(ii) Analysis of data collected;



15

A/56/661

(iii) Development of an operational and system
architecture;

(iv) Writing the draft manual;

(v) Reviewing and testing;

(vi) Obtaining approval;

(c) Chiefs of Geographic Cell (P-3 level) for
UNMEE, UNAMSIL and MONUC are being selected
and are expected to be on board no later than January
2002;

(d) GIS technicians (Field Service/other level)
are being selected and are expected to be on board by
the end of January 2002;

(e) Basic GIS training for 17 staff of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations is ongoing and
will be completed by the end of November 2001. The
participants are from the following offices:

(i) Situation Center (3);

(ii) Military Planning Service (3);

(iii) Force Generation Service (2);

(iv) Mine Action Service (1);

(v) Financial Management and Support Service
(1);

(vi) Logistics and Communications Support (7);

(f) The GIS systems for UNMEE and MONUC
are being ordered.
