Financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone

Financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the
Secretary-General on the proposed budget for the
operation of the United Nations Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNAMSIL) for the period from 1 July 2001 to
30 June 2002 contained in document A/56/487. During
its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee
met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information.

2. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone was
established by the Security Council by its resolution
1270 (1999) of 22 October 1999. The mandate of the
Mission has since been extended and adjusted by
subsequent Council resolutions, the latest of which was
resolution 1370 (2001) of 18 September 2001, which
extended the mandate of UNAMSIL for a period of six
months from 30 September 2001. By its resolution
1346 (2001) of 30 March 2001, the Security Council
decided to increase the military component of the
Mission to a force strength of 17,500 personnel,
including 260 military observers.

3. The Advisory Committee recalls that the
Controller, in his letter dated 22 March 2001, informed
the Committee that recent and prospective anticipated
developments specific to certain peacekeeping
missions (including UNAMSIL) would likely affect
their mandates, operational concepts, scope and scale
of activities and related resource requirements. The

Controller, therefore, requested that the Advisory
Committee recommend to the General Assembly, as an
interim measure, the granting of commitment
authorization with assessment in the amount of $275
million gross for the maintenance of UNAMSIL for the
period from 1 July to 31 December 2001, pending
submission of the detailed UNAMSIL budget to the
General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.

4. On the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee (see A/55/874, para. 10 (c)) the General
Assembly, by its resolution 55/251 B of 14 June 2001,
authorized the Secretary-General to enter into
commitments in the amount of $275 million gross for
the maintenance of UNAMSIL for the period from 1
July to 31 December 2001, and decided that this
amount should be assessed on Member States.

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that
amounts totalling $1,040.2 million have been assessed
on Member States in respect of UNAMSIL since its
inception to 31 December 2001 and that contributions
received as at 30 September 2001 totalled $580.2
million. Outstanding balances amount to $460 million.

6. Cash balances of UNAMSIL amounted to $222.4
million as at 15 October 2001. The Advisory
Committee was informed that troop-contributing
countries had received payments totalling
$164,294,795 for the period from 1 November 1999 to
31 March 2001 and that an estimated amount of



2
A/56/621

$89,331,738 was still due for the period from 1 April to
30 September 2001. The Committee was also informed
that reimbursement to troop-contributing Member
States covering the months of April through September
2001 was expected to be made by the end of 2001,
subject to the availability of cash.

7. The proposed budget for UNAMSIL for the
period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 amounts to
$722,134,800 gross ($716,498,400 net), exclusive of
budgeted voluntary contributions in kind amounting to
$1,350,133. The Committee sought clarification of the
procedures to be followed in budgeting for additional
support account requirements related to UNAMSIL and
was informed that it would be the intention of the
Secretary-General, based on such decision as the
General Assembly may take on the additional resources
under the support account for peacekeeping operations,
to prorate the financing of the additional approved
resources for the support account among the missions
whose updated budgets would be considered during the
current fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly:
UNAMSIL, the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL), the United Nations Mission in
Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (MONUC) and the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).

8. As indicated in paragraph 5 of the proposed
budget, the estimated requirements for the period from
1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 represent a 31.3 per cent
increase in total resources (gross) in relation to the
apportionment for the financial period 2000/01. The
Committee notes from table 1 of the report that the
total increase of 31.3 per cent reflects a 38.5 per cent
increase in military personnel costs, a 42 per cent
increase in civilian personnel costs, a 9.9 per cent
increase in operational costs, a 73.4 per cent increase in
staff assessment and a 28.8 per cent increase in other
programmes. The Committee also notes from the table
that for the financial period 2000/01, expenditures
amounted to $493 million, leaving an unspent balance
of $57 million, compared to the appropriation of $550
million.

9. The Advisory Committee recalls that the
Secretary-General estimated requirements for the
Mission during the financial period from 1 July 2000 to
30 June 2001 at $562 million. The Committee
recommended an appropriation of $550 million, of
which $513.4 million was to be assessed, with the

balance of the assessment of $36.6 million to be
considered at a later stage. The reported expenditure of
$493 million is therefore $20.4 million less than the
amount of the assessment of $513.4 million
recommended by the Advisory Committee and, taking
into account the $36.6 million not committed, the
underexpenditure is about 13 per cent less than the
estimated requirements of $562 million proposed by
the Secretary-General. In this connection, attention is
drawn to the comments of the Advisory Committee
in its report of 16 March 2001, in which it expressed
doubt about the capacity of the Mission to commit
and use all the resources requested by the
Secretary-General (A/55/839, para. 53).

10. The Advisory Committee sought clarification of
the unspent balance of $57 million for the financial
period 2000/01 and was informed that it was mainly
due to the following:

(a) Reduced requirements for rations in the
light of delayed deployment of military personnel
($29.8 million under military personnel);

(b) Delayed deployment of civilian personnel
($3.9 million under civilian personnel);

(c) Reduced operational requirements (a total
of $22.9 million) due mainly to lower utilization of
generators ($4.4 million), lower cost of air operations
($4.8 million) and lower acquisition of equipment as
well as lower unit cost of equipment ($9.2 million).

The Committee was also informed that requirements
that are carried forward to the period from 1 July 2001
to 30 June 2002 amount to $4.4 million and relate to
the acquisition of 195 generators.

11. The Advisory Committee was provided with
information on estimated expenditure during the period
from 1 July to 31 December 2001, as at 16 October
2001, which is reproduced in annex I below. The
Committee observes that expenditure of $233.6 million
includes the amount of $49.8 million in unliquidated
obligations and $157.6 million in pre-encumbrances.
Upon enquiry, the following definition for “pre-
encumbrances” was provided by the Secretariat: “pre-
encumbrances act as the general reservation of funds
equivalent to requisitions. Pre-encumbrances in the
Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) are
a mandatory requirement prior to the obligation
(purchase order) stages and serve to set aside funds for
a given purpose”. This procedure, in effect, allows the



3
A/56/621

retention of funds that may not ultimately be obligated
and disbursed in their totality.

12. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 4
of the proposed budget that it does not contain any
additional resources that, in the view of the Secretary-
General, may be necessary for UNAMSIL to support
the forthcoming electoral process in Sierra Leone and
that the Controller intends to revert to the Advisory
Committee and the General Assembly should
additional resources be required. The Committee was
informed, upon enquiry, that it was the intention of the
Secretary-General to send experts to Sierra Leone to
follow the deliberations of the consultative conference,
the outcome of which would be known by the end of
November 2001. Moreover, the Committee was
informed that, as at the time of its consideration of the
Secretary-General’s report, no definite timetable had
been worked out for the preparation for and holding of
the elections. The Advisory Committee was informed
that the tentative date for the election is now 14 May
2002. The Advisory Committee regrets that there
appears to be a lack of proper and adequate
planning at Headquarters for the forthcoming
elections, including for the registration process.

13. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
incumbency situation of UNAMSIL, as at 17 October
2001, was as follows:

Category of personnel
Authorized

level Encumbered
Vacancy rate
(Percentage)

Military contingentsa 17 240 16 489 4.3

Military observers 260 245 5.7

Civilian police 60 54 10.0

International staff 333 284 14.7

Local staff 585 485 17.1

United Nations Volunteers 130 111 14.6

a The Advisory Committee was informed of the imminent
full deployment of the Nepalese contingent.

14. The Advisory Committee notes from the report of
the Secretary-General (A/56/487, annex I.C) that the
proposed estimates for UNAMSIL reflects the
following deployment assumptions:

(a) Under military contingents — the actual
deployment of troops for the months from July through
September 2001 and the full strength of 17,240
personnel during the remaining period of nine months;

(b) Under military observers — the actual
deployment of military observers for the months from
July through September 2001 and the application of a 5
per cent delayed deployment factor during the
remaining period of nine months;

(c) Under civilian police — the actual
deployment of police advisers for the months from July
through September 2001 and the application of a 5 per
cent delayed deployment factor during the remaining
period of nine months;

(d) Under international and local staff — a 10
per cent vacancy rate;

(e) Under United Nations Volunteers — the
actual deployment for the months of July through
September 2001, phased deployment for the period
from October 2001 to January 2002 and the full
strength of 168 Volunteers during the period from
February to June 2002.

Military personnel costs

15. The estimates under military personnel costs for
the financial period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002
are based on an authorized strength of 17,500 military
personnel, including 260 military observers. As
indicated in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/56/487, annex I.C, para. 4), the estimates for
reimbursement to troop-contributing countries for troop
costs are based on the new standard rates approved by
the General Assembly in its resolution 55/274,
reflecting two consecutive increases of two percentage
points, effective 1 July 2001 and 1 January 2002, on an
interim and ad hoc basis. The Committee also notes
that the requirements under military contingents do not
include the provision of bottled water since the mission
has installed water purification systems to provide
clean drinking water.

Memoranda of understanding

16. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-
General (A/56/487, annex I.C, para. 5), the estimated
requirements for contingent-owned equipment are
based on memoranda of understanding already
concluded or under active negotiation with current and
prospective troop contributors. The Committee was
informed, that out of a total of 68 memoranda of
understanding, 20 had been signed, 45 were under



4
A/56/621

negotiation (including 15 with a troop-contributing
country that had repatriated all of its 15 units) with 3
remaining to be negotiated. The fact that a troop-
contributing country would leave before a
memorandum was signed would indicate that the
process continues to be too slow.

Contingent-owned equipment and
self-sustainment

17. Total estimated requirements of $169.6 million
are proposed under contingent-owned equipment for
the reimbursement to troop-contributing countries for
major equipment they provide to their respective
contingents serving with the Mission ($86.2 million)
and under self-sustainment ($83.3 million). As
indicated in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/56/487, annex I.C, paras. 5 and 6), these
requirements are based on the new standard rates
approved by the General Assembly in its resolution
55/274. The Committee was informed that the status of
reimbursement to troop-contributing countries for
contingent-owned equipment and self sustainment, as
at 15 October 2001, is as follows: (a) an amount of
$7.1 million was reimbursed, (b) the amount owed is
estimated at $192.9 million, and (c) unliquidated
obligations are estimated at $144.8 million. The
Committee was also informed that accounts payable,
which relate to contingent-owned equipment and self-
sustainment, amount to $13.1 million. The Committee
points out that the latter amount, relative to the
total obligation of $144.8 million, appears to
indicate a very slow pace of processing claims for
contingent-owned equipment. It also illustrates that
there may be inadequate capacity in the
verifications process in the field and in the
processing of claims at Headquarters.

18. In this connection, the Advisory Committee
recalls that it had discussed, on a number of occasions,
shortcomings in the operation and management of the
new contingent-owned equipment arrangements (see,
in particular, A/55/874 and A/55/839). The Committee
also recalls that the issue of the application of the wet
lease arrangement at UNAMSIL was expected to be the
subject of an overall policy review (see A/55/839, para.
16). The Committee was informed that the overall
policy review had not been undertaken. Instead, the
Mission dealt with contingent-owned equipment and
self-sustainment deficiencies on an ad hoc basis

through increased efforts in pre-deployment
inspections and follow-up actions to remedy identified
weaknesses. Information is provided below, at the
Committee’s request, illustrating solutions to
contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment
deficiencies at UNAMSIL and their application to
some other peacekeeping operations (see annex II). The
Committee was assured that, as a result of the efforts
made, the capacity of contingents to discharge the
Mission’s mandate had, on the whole, improved after
deployment and while serving with the Mission. The
Committee commends the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and UNAMSIL for their
efforts to address the deficiencies in the Mission and
trusts the experience will be valuable for other
missions.

19. In the course of its deliberations, the Advisory
Committee was informed of instances where the United
Nations has taken over functions that contingents had
been expected to provide for themselves. This
development calls into question the applicability of
new contingent-owned equipment arrangements to
many troop-contributing countries that may not be in a
position to provide the required services for their
contingents. In this connection, the Committee was
informed that, under these circumstances, the related
memoranda of understanding are not always modified
in a timely manner and some are not modified at all.
The Committee is of the view that the matter needs
to be reviewed urgently.

20. The Advisory Committee discussed the issues of
verification and the need for qualified staff for
verification functions (see A/55/874, para. 29). The
Committee was informed that about 10 staff are
involved in verification functions at UNAMSIL (either
full or part time), however there was no procedure in
place to determine more accurately the need for staff
for these important functions. Taking into account the
magnitude of expenditures involved, as well as the
need to promote efficiency and thus reduce
operational costs, the Committee recommends the
development of benchmarks for determining
capacity for verification. Moreover, the Committee
reiterates its view that nationals from a troop-
contributing country should not normally be called
upon to review or verify equipment or operational
readiness of national contingents from their own
country.

A/56/621

Civilian personnel costs

21. The estimated requirements of $56.1 million for
civilian personnel, which represent a 42 per cent
increase compared with the apportionment for the
financial period 2000/01, would provide for 60 civilian
police, 390 international staff (168 Professional, 49
General Service, 137 Field Service and 36 Security
Service), 616 local staff and 168 United Nations
Volunteers. The proposed staffing reflects an increase
of 30 Professional posts (1 D-2, 3 D-1, 1 P-5, 1 P-4, 22
P-3 and 2 P-2/P-1), 3 General Service (Other level)
posts, 24 Field Service posts, 31 Local-level posts and
38 United Nations Volunteers. In addition, the staffing
proposal provides for the reclassification of nine posts
(1 D-1, 4 P-5 and 4 P-4). It also provides for the
establishment of a new unit, the Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration Management Unit,
within the organizational structure of the Mission.

22. The Advisory Committee expresses its concern
about the lack of clarity in the proposals for the
reclassification and transfer of posts. It is not easy
to distinguish between posts that are proposed for
reclassification from proposals for transfer of posts
between organizational units. The Committee notes
that proposals are made to reclassify a post
upwards followed by a second proposal to transfer
to another unit the same post at its original lower
level. This procedure confuses the initial post
classification and reclassification of the post.

23. The Committee points out that posts are
classified initially by the Secretary-General before
submitting his estimates to the General Assembly
with a request to establish a post at the level it has
been classified. Once the Assembly approves the
post, the Secretary-General can subsequently
request a reclassification of the post if the nature,
scope and content of the function have changed. The
proposals in the UNAMSIL budget estimates
amount to the carrying out of a second post
classification while proposing a transfer of the same
post previously approved by the Assembly. This
procedure results in a form of double counting
where one post in fact becomes two.

24. Accordingly, in instances where the Advisory
Committee has recommended approval of a
reclassification, it has made its recommendation
against the proposed redeployment of the post at its

former level. The table below clarifies new posts and
reclassification proposals.

25. The Advisory Committee recommends
acceptance of the request for six additional posts for
the Human Rights Office, however, it requests that
United Nations Volunteers be used wherever
possible.

26. The Advisory Committee notes from the report
(A/56/487, para. 26 (b)), that a P-5 post of the Chief of
the Office for Policy and Planning is proposed for
upgrading to the D-1 level and an additional P-4 post is



6
A/56/621

proposed in connection with the development and
implementation of a comprehensive mission-wide HIV
prevention programme in order to reduce the likelihood
of HIV transmission to and by UNAMSIL personnel.
Although the Committee had previously
recommended against the upgrading of this P-5 post
(A/55/839, para. 40), for the reasons explained in
para. 27 (b) of the report, it now recommends
acceptance of the proposal.

27. The Advisory Committee recommends the
establishment of the new P-4 post. At the same time
the Committee is of the view that there is a need to
formulate a Secretariat policy on how peacekeeping
missions should deal with the question of
HIV/AIDS. In this connection, the Committee
points out that the responsibility for health of
personnel before arrival is that of the contributing
authority. The policies to be developed should also
cover situations where it is later discovered that
individuals have HIV/AIDS.

28. A request for the reclassifications of a P-5 post to
the D-1 level is resubmitted for the Civil Affairs
Office. In addition, two new Professional posts (1 P-4
and 1 P-3) and 4 positions for United Nations
Volunteers are requested for the Office. The Committee
recalls that it did not support the reclassification of the
P-5 post in its report of 16 March 2001 (A/55/839,
para. 41). The Committee finds no sufficient
justification for changing its position.

29. With regard to the request for new Professional
posts and positions for United Nations Volunteers, the
Advisory Committee observes that responsibilities of
two additional posts for Electoral Officers (1 P-4 and 1
P-3) are described in the report of the Secretary-
General (A/56/487, para. 26 (c) (ii)). The Committee
has no objection to the requested establishment of
two posts (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) for Electoral Officers.
The report of the Secretary-General contains
information on the additional four positions for United
Nations Volunteers in the Civil Affairs Office
(A/56/487, para. 26 (b) (i)). The Committee has no
objection to the proposal with respect to the four
positions. At the same time, the Committee requests
that the staffing requirements of the Civil Affairs
Office be reviewed after the elections are held.

30. The proposed staffing structure for the new
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration
Management Unit provides for the establishment of

three Professional posts (1 P-5 and 2 P-4) and 20
positions for United Nations Volunteers. The Advisory
Committee notes that, in response to its request in its
previous report (A/55/839, para. 65), the Secretary-
General’s report contains information on the Mission’s
role in the disarmament, demobilization and the
reintegration programme (A/56/487, paras. 36-39). In
the course of its deliberations, the Committee was
informed that the disarmament programme was
proceeding well and was to be completed by the end of
November 2001. The Committee was also informed
that, as at the time of the preparation of the report of
the Secretary-General, about 22,000 combatants had
been disarmed (exclusive of child soldiers, who are
dealt with under a separate programme). The new unit
would manage demobilization and reintegration. The
Advisory Committee recommends approval of the
proposed staffing structure of the new unit (1 P-5, 2
P-4 and 20 United Nations Volunteers).

31. Seven additional local-level posts are proposed
for the Public Information Office. In this connection,
the Advisory Committee recalls that it has made a
number of observations and recommendations with
regard to the UNAMSIL public information
programme (see A/55/839, para. 44). The Committee
notes that, in response to its recommendation, the
report of the Secretary-General contains a concise
explanation of the public information programme
(A/56/487, paras. 29-35). The report also contains
information on the additional seven local-level posts (2
Community Liaison Assistants, 2 News
Coordinators/Producers/Translators, 1 Writer/Editor
Assistant, 1 Radio Producer and 1 Studio Technician)
(A/56/487, para. 26 (e)). The Committee recommends
acceptance of the proposal for these seven
additional local-level posts. At the same time, the
Committee draws attention to what appears to be a
lack of effective planning and implementation of the
public information programme. For example, for
the period ending 30 June 2001, only $115,100 out
of the apportionment of $457,400 was committed;
for the period from 1 July to 30 December 2001,
only $20,500 out of $228,800 was reported as
expenditure as at 16 October 2001. The
representatives of the Secretary-General were not
able to provide an explanation for this rate of
commitment. Updated information in this regard
should be provided to the Fifth Committee.



7
A/56/621

32. A request for the reclassification of a D-1 post to
the D-2 level is resubmitted for the Director of
Administration. In addition, a reclassification is
proposed for a P-4 post of Chief Budget Officer to the
P-5 level. The staffing proposal for the Office of the
Director of Administration also provides for the
establishment of three Professional and four General
Service posts (3 P-3, 2 GS and 2 LL) as well as four
positions for United Nations Volunteers.

33. The Advisory Committee recalls that it did not
support the reclassification of the D-1 post of the
Director of Administration (see A/55/839, para. 46).
The Committee finds no sufficient justification for
changing its position.

34. In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, no
compelling reason has been advanced to reclassify,
at this stage, the post of the chief of the budget
section from P-4 to P-5. In this connection, the
Committee is of the opinion that the function of
budgeting and monitoring of budget
implementation in the Mission should not be subject
to unnecessary frequent changes in personnel as
this would adversely affect efforts to develop budget
expertise and institutional memory for the effective
discharge of the budget function.

35. With regard to the proposed establishment in the
Office of the Director of Administration of two P-3
posts (Board of Inquiry Officers), one P-3 (Budget
Officer), two General Service and two local-level posts
(Budget Assistants) and four positions for United
Nations Volunteers (Secretaries, Board of Inquiry), the
Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of
these requests.

36. The Advisory Committee recalls that a request for
a D-1 post in the Office of Administrative Services was
not approved when the Committee reviewed the budget
proposal for the financial period 2000/01 (see
A/55/839, para. 47). The Committee finds no
sufficient grounds for changing its position.

37. Information on the proposed increase of one
General Service post (assistant to the Chief Civilian
Personnel Officer) and three local-level posts
(Personnel Clerks) in the Personnel Section is
contained in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/56/487, para. 27 (e)). As indicated therein, the
increase would “enable the Personnel Section to
effectively discharge the requisite personnel and
administrative responsibilities”. The Committee recalls

its observation in its report of 16 March 2001
(A/55/839, para. 30), that the Committee had doubts
“whether the Mission and Headquarters have the
capacity to recruit and place on board the requested
number of staff” within such a short period of time and
urged the Secretariat to accelerate the recruitment and
placement of civilian personnel in UNAMSIL. The
Committee is concerned that the capacity to recruit
and place staff on board appears to deteriorate
further. For example, the vacancy rates, which
amounted to 5.7 per cent among international staff
and 2.6 per cent among local staff as at 22 February
2001, have increased to 14.7 per cent and 17.1 per
cent, respectively, as at 17 October 2001. Under the
circumstances, the Committee recommends
acceptance of the proposals for the additional posts.

38. In the course of its deliberations, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the Mission is reluctant
to assume additional recruitment authority in the
absence of essential tools that are currently being
developed at Headquarters, including a roster of
candidates and generic job profiles. Moreover, the
Committee was informed of situations where
information concerning candidates was sent with no
essential elements to allow for the evaluation of the
candidates. The Committee requests that urgent
consideration be given to delegating to missions the
more routine and time-consuming issues that are
currently carried out at Headquarters, such as
home leave authorizations, family visits and
payment of hazard duty allowance.

39. The Advisory Committee concludes from the
testimony of representatives of the Secretary-
General that coordination between staff security
within the responsibility of the United Nations
Office for Security Coordination and UNAMSIL
needs clarification and improvement particularly as
regards training and readiness of staff in the same
location from United Nations funds and
programmes, agencies and from UNAMSIL.

40. The establishment of two local-level posts and
two positions for United Nations Volunteers is
proposed for the General Services Section (Travel
Unit) due to “the forward deployment of the Mission
and the consequent increase in its civilian component”,
as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/56/487, para. 27 (d)). The Advisory Committee
has no objection to the proposal.

A/56/621

41. A proposal for the upgrading of a P-5 post in
the Integrated Support Service to the D-1 level is
resubmitted for the financial period 2001/02. The
Advisory Committee has no objection to the
proposal in view of the additional responsibilities of
the Service for the functions taken over after the
termination of the logistical contract.

42. A proposal is made for the reclassification of a P-
4 post to the P-5 level and establishment of 10 Field
Service posts in the Building Management Support and
Engineering Section. The Committee was informed,
upon enquiry, that a P-4 post of the Chief of the
Section is currently encumbered by a P-5 staff member.
The Committee has no objection to the
regularization of this post.

43. With regard to the proposal for 10 new Field
Service posts, the Advisory Committee observes that
an additional 91 positions were approved for the
Section for the financial period 2000/01 (2 P-3, 84
local-level and 5 United Nations Volunteers),
increasing its staffing to the current level of 145
positions. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-
General (A/56/487, para. 27 (f)), the additional 10
Field Service posts are proposed to accommodate:
three Construction Supervisors, three Generator
Mechanics, one Head of the Air Conditioning Unit, one
Air Conditioning Technician, one Head for the
Generator Unit and one Administrative Assistant. The
Committee notes from the report of the Secretary-
General that the request for additional posts is due to
the substantial growth in engineering requirements.
The Committee stresses that all requests for
additional posts should be justified by workload
data and other objective criteria and should not be
couched only in terms of broad generalities, such as
“growth in requirements”, “increased workload”,
“additional responsibilities” and so forth. In view of
the recommendations of the Committee on the
increase in staffing of the Building Management
Support and Engineering Section for the financial
period 2000/01, the Committee recommends
approval of six additional Field Service posts to be
assigned in a manner to be determined by the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General.

44. The Advisory Committee does not find
sufficient justification for the upgrading of a P-4
post of the Chief of the Joint Movement Control
Section, which is proposed “in view of the expansion
of the Mission and the need to strengthen the

management of the air and ground transportation
control mechanism” (see A/56/487, para. 27 (g)). In
this connection the Committee reiterates the
comments made in its report of 16 March 2001
(A/55/839, para. 32).

45. A proposal is made for the reclassification of the
P-4 post of the Chief of the Supply Section to the P-5
level and the establishment of 15 P-3 posts and 5
positions for United Nations Volunteers in the Section.
The Committee recognizes the increased
responsibilities of the Chief of the Supply Section for
control, management and monitoring of the self-
sustainment and wet-lease arrangements of contingents,
as described in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/56/487, para. 27 (h)). The Committee, therefore,
recommends approval of the upgrading.

46. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-
General, the additional 15 P-3 posts and 5 positions for
United Nations Volunteers for the Supply Section are
proposed “in view of the expansion in the military
component of the Mission and therefore the
corresponding increase in contingent-owned and
United Nations-owned equipment” (A/56/487, para. 27
(h)). This proposal, if approved, would increase the
number of Professional staff of the Section from 2 to
17. The Advisory Committee recalls that it had already
recommended a significant increase in staff of the
Section for the financial period ended 30 June 2001
(including 1 P-3, 1 P-2 and 20 local-level posts). The
Committee also agreed that the P-3 and P-2 posts
should be converted into United Nations Volunteers
positions (see A/55/839, paras. 26, 49 and 51 and
annex I). The Committee sought and received
additional information in respect of the staffing
proposal, which appears to be driven, at least in part,
by the recommendations of the resident auditor of the
Office of Internal Oversight Services who called on
UNAMSIL to: (a) promptly conduct inspection,
verification and reporting of contingent-owned
equipment to ensure the operational readiness of
troops; (b) ensure that verification reports conform
strictly to the terms used in memoranda of
understanding to avoid payment for equipment wrongly
deployed to the mission area; and (c) the contingent-
owned equipment Management Unit be strengthened
with more qualified personnel now that the Mission
will be expanding owing to the deployment of more
troops. The Committee has no objection to the
proposal, in view of its comments and



9
A/56/621

recommendations in paragraphs 17 to 19 above and
the need to strengthen the management of
contingent-owned equipment.

47. The report of the Secretary-General contains
information on the proposed establishment of 11 Field
Service posts and 5 local-level posts in the Electronic
Support Services Section (A/56/487, para. 27 (i)). No
analysis is provided, however, which could indicate the
basis for the increase of 16 posts. The proposal, if
approved, would increase the number of personnel of
all categories of the Section from 74 to 90. The
Advisory Committee requests that a complete
detailed analysis of staffing requirements for the
Section be included in the budget estimates for the
financial period 2002-2003. In the meantime, the
Committee recommends the establishment of 5
Field Service posts and 3 local-level posts.

48. The current staffing establishment of the
Transport Section is 143 positions and it is proposed to
increase it by 3 Field Service posts, 12 local-level posts
and 3 United Nations Volunteer positions, to a total of
161 positions, that is by 12.5 per cent. As indicated in
the report of the Secretary-General (A/56/487, para.
27 (j)), the staffing increase is due to the establishment
of three additional sector workshops. The Committee
recommends the establishment of 3 Field Service
posts (Motor Transport Officers), 9 local-level posts
(Car Washer/Tire Repairers) and 3 United Nations
Volunteer positions (Vehicle Mechanics).

49. The report of the Secretary-General (A/56/487,
paras. 39-41) contains information requested by the
Advisory Committee (A/55/839, para. 29) on the
termination of the logistical contract. The Mission
asserts that “the contractor consistently failed to
perform its contractual obligations, continuously failed
to correct serious identified deficiencies and did not
have the required personnel to perform the tasks
identified in the contract” (A/56/487, para. 39). The
Mission analysed the matter and concluded that the
total monthly cost charged by the contractor (DynCorp)
at full mobilization was $409,530, compared to the
total monthly labour cost of $83,909 incurred by the
Mission. The Committee notes that UNAMSIL hired
seven international staff and 210 local staff to perform
the functions previously performed by DynCorp; the
hired staff was used in the following areas: two P-3
staff members in the Building Management Support
and Engineering Section, 2 Field Service staff in the
Transport Section and 3 Field Service staff in the

Aviation Support Section, 36 local-level staff in the
Transport Section, 3 local-level staff in the
Procurement Section, 20 local-level staff in the Supply
Section, 84 local-level staff in the Building
Management Support and Engineering Section, 10
local-level staff in the Joint Movement Control Section
and 57 local-level staff in the Aviation Section.

50. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon
enquiry, that various audit reports had pointed out that
UNAMSIL did not adequately supervise or monitor the
performance of the contractor. UNAMSIL responded
that the deficiencies were attributable to the lack of
personnel with the requisite experience to carry out
these functions. The Committee raised questions on
performance monitoring and whether payments were
withheld for bad performance and was informed that
“although UNAMSIL staff issued performance reports
from time to time, they were, however, not in the
normal quality assurance format as the Mission lacked
the capacity and the relevant training to perform the
evaluation, monitoring and rating functions of the
quality assurance as stipulated in the contract, and
therefore were not in a position to withhold payment”.
The Committee is of the view that the lack of ability
of the Mission and Headquarters to deal with
serious problems in managing the logistical
contractor is unacceptable. The Committee requests
that a thorough analysis be undertaken of all
aspects of the situation with the contractor and the
results of the lessons learned be made available to
the management of peacekeeping operations and to
the relevant departments and offices at
Headquarters.

Travel

51. The estimated requirements of $671,900 are
proposed for official travel between the Mission and
New York in connection with the travel of New York
Headquarters staff and senior Mission personnel for
political and military consultations, as well as to troop-
contributing countries in connection with the
inspection and transportation of contingent-owned
equipment to the mission area, as indicated in the
report of the Secretary-General (A/56/487, annex I.C,
para. 12). In the opinion of the Advisory Committee,
estimates for the travel programme detailed in the
report of the Secretary-General may be somewhat
overstated (A/56/487, annex II.A). Some items of the



10

A/56/621

travel programme reflect considerable cost growth;
travel from Headquarters is estimated at $110,600,
compared with $83,800 in the previous budget
submission and travel to troop-contributing countries is
estimated at $154,600, compared with $25,600 in the
previous budget submission. The Committee observes
that in response to its previous recommendation on the
travel programme of UNAMSIL (see A/55/839, para.
50), information is included in the report of the
Secretary-General on measures taken to reduce the cost
of travel, including regular bi-weekly videoconferences
between the Mission and Headquarters (A/56/487,
annex IV). Although the Committee recognizes the
increase in the cost of verification, it recalls its view
that further measures should be taken to reduce the
need for travel and/or to make it considerably less
costly.

Operational requirements

52. The proposed estimates of $161.5 million under
operational requirements reflect an increase of $14.5
million over the apportionment of $146.9 million for
the financial period 2000/01. Of the total of $161.5
million, an amount of $39.3 million is for non-
recurrent expenditures, including $15.9 million under
premises/accommodations, $11.3 million under other
equipment, $5.1 million under transport operations and
$4.8 million under communications. In some instances
there appears to be an overestimation of requests, for
example, an additional 71 vehicles are proposed for
purchase based on a 1:2.5 ratio for international staff.
On this basis, the number of United Nations civilian
pattern vehicles would be increased from 755 to 800.
Other ratios, such as those for communications,
accommodation, other equipment and supplies and
services, could, in the opinion of the Committee, also
lead to an overestimation of requirements. Except for
those ratios that have recently been authorized by
the General Assembly up to June 2001, many of the
standards currently in use may need to be further
reviewed in the light of past performance. The
Committee will revert to this question in the context
of its examination of the peacekeeping budgets for
the financial period 2002/03 in February/March
2002.

53. The largest element of operational requirements
falls under air operations estimated at $75.8 million.
These estimates reflect an increase of $18.9 million,

compared with the apportionment of $56.9 million for
the financial period 2000/01. The Advisory Committee
recalls its comments and observations with regard to
requirements for air operations for the financial period
2000/01, including those with regard to the executive
jet used by the Mission (see A/55/839, para. 57). The
Committee reviewed the Secretariat’s replies to its
questions about the recently acquired 8-seat
executive jet and noted that it is used only by
UNAMSIL, thus its cost is not shared with any
other United Nations entity. The Committee
questions the need for a change to this sort of
aircraft, particularly given improved local medical
facilities and the possibilities for commercial
medical evacuation.  The Committee requests that
the contract be urgently reviewed in order to find
alternatives to the use of the executive jet.

54. The Advisory Committee notes from additional
information provided to it that, due to uncertainties
highlighted in its report of March 2001 (A/55/839),
large underexpenditures have been reported. The
Committee draws attention to the fact that similar,
though not as extensive, delays could be experienced
in trying to process all actions to commit the entire
requested resources during the time left in the
financial period ending 30 June 2002.

55. Taking into account its comments and
observations in the paragraphs above, the Advisory
Committee recommends that the General Assembly
approve an appropriation of $692 million gross for
the maintenance of UNAMSIL for the period from 1
July 2001 to 30 June 2002, inclusive of the amount
of $275 million gross already appropriated and
assessed by the Assembly in its resolution 55/251 B
for the period from 1 July 2001 to 31 December
2001. The Committee recommends that the
Assembly assess the additional amount of $244
million gross for a total amount of assessment of
$519 million gross for the period from 1 July to 31
March 2002.

56. The Advisory Committee further recommends
that the amount of $132 million gross be assessed
for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2002, at a
monthly rate of $44 million gross, should the
Security Council decide to continue the mandate of
the Mission. Moreover, in view of the observations
of the Committee in the paragraphs above, the
General Assembly may wish, in addition, to
authorize the Secretary-General to enter into



11

A/56/621

commitments (without assessment) in the amount of
up to $41 million, for the period from 1 April to 30
June 2002, should the Security Council decide to
continue the mandate of UNAMSIL beyond 31
March 2002. Thus, the total authority available for
the period from 1 April to 30 June 2002 would be
$173 million.

Annex II
Solutions to contingent-owned equipment and self-
sustainment deficiencies in the United Nations Mission
in Sierra Leone

1. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was established on
the general basis that all contingents capable of providing all major contingent-
owned equipment on a wet-lease basis and fully self-sustaining in all relevant
categories would be accepted for service (nuclear, biological and chemical
protection, for example, was assessed as not required). This included the “rehatted”,
already deployed, contingents of the former Military Observer Group of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG). The table below
summarizes the operational problems encountered with this approach and the
solutions adopted. It also indicates where UNAMSIL specific solutions have been
used as guidance in the set-up of more recent peacekeeping operations, namely the
United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUC) and the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).

Serial Problem Solution Application  to other peacekeeping operations

1. Ex-ECOMOG and after May
2000, other contingents prove
unable to provide, replace or
maintain the required contingent-
owned equipment, particularly
vehicles, or to provide
themselves with essential support
in the areas of communications,
electrical (power generation and
distribution), water supply, fuel
storage, minor engineering and
other minor areas.

Letter of assist established with a
Member State to provide
temporary support in the form of
vehicles and self-sustainment
services. United Nations-owned
equipment issued to supplement
the letter of assist. After several
extensions of the letter of assist,
contingents induct necessary
equipment and United Nations
builds capacity to provide
additional support. Letter of
assist to finally expire
31 October 2001.

A major contingent is deployed
on the basis that the United
Nations will provide major and
self-sustainment electrical
(power generation and
distribution) support.

Most contingents in MONUC are
provided with electrical and
minor engineering support by the
United Nations. MONUC guard
units are provided with
refurbished accommodation by
the United Nations.

2. Ex-ECOMOG and after May
2000, other contingents prove
unable to deploy sufficient
armoured personnel carriers or
heavy trucks to the Mission.

Memorandum of understanding
with a Member State established,
which provides over 200
armoured personnel carriers and
200 heavy trucks that are
distributed to other contingents.
The Member State provides
training in vehicle use and full

Armoured personnel carrier
provided to a contingent in
UNMEE by another Member
State.
Similar measures initially
considered for MONUC but not
required as contingents can
provide for themselves.

A/56/621

Serial Problem Solution Application  to other peacekeeping operations

maintenance (wet-lease) support.
100 trucks retained by the
Member State contingent to form
general support transport
company for all Mission
requirements.

Memorandum of understanding
established with a Member State
to provide a logistics battalion,
which includes a transport
company to further reduce
deficiency in transport assets.

3. Several contingents prove unable
to provide sufficient
communications assets.

In addition to letter of assist and
United Nations-owned
equipment provided on loan, a
memorandum of understanding is
established with a Member State
to provide a complete
communications battalion to
support contingent and general
Mission operations.

4. The Field Administration and
Logistics Division identifies a
pending shortfall of contingent’s
abilities to provide field defence
stores to construct protective
fortifications. Field defence
stores include barbed wire,
timber, sandbags, metal stakes,
metal sheets and associated
construction supplies. These are
heavy, bulky, not cost-effective
to buy or ship in small quantities
and frequently cannot be
recovered for use later.

The United Nations assumes
responsibility for providing field
defence stores for a number of
deployed contingents and new
contingents start with this
system.

Field defence stores provided in
bulk by the United Nations for
MONUC and UNMEE

5. Several contingents are unable to
provide or maintain adequate
tentage.

The United Nations acquires 385
tents from a Member State on
donation and purchases 400 tents
from another Member State to
make up the shortfalls.

Tentage provided to most
UNMEE contingents on
deployment.

6. Contingents found to be unable
to provide sufficient basic
furniture, catering facilities and
laundry/dry cleaning capabilities
to meet the standards as detailed

The Contingent-owned
equipment Manual standards
amended to allow contingents to
receive full reimbursement,
provided national standards are

Applied for MONUC and
UNMEE as appropriate.

equipment Manual.

met and essential health and
safety criteria are not
compromised (e.g. some African
contingent catering
arrangements, while not strictly
complying with the Manual, are
the norm for their operations in
field environments).

7. Contingents found to be deficient
in ability to provide satisfactory
medical support.

The United Nations seeks
donation of medical (level 1)
equipment from a Member State.
Donation of Swedish level 2
medical equipment to be
operated by the Ghanaian
contingent arranged and the
United Nations provides medical
consumables.

8. A troop-contributing country
offers a sector headquarters and
level 2 hospital, but can provide
only the personnel.

The United Nations accepts the
offer and provides all contingent-
owned equipment and self-
sustainment support to both
units.

MONUC contingents are
supported by an agreed mix of
self-sustainment providers prior
to deployment.

9. A Member State offers a
battalion but can only partly
meet the contingent-owned
equipment requirement and
needs assistance with
communications and some other
self-sustainment items.

The United Nations accepts offer
and undertakes to provide
required contingent-owned
equipment (United Nations-
owned equipment, third party
troop-contributing country,
armoured personnel carrier and
trucks). A Member State donates
funds to procure 12 additional
light vehicles as United Nations-
owned equipment, to be used by
the battalion. Another Member
State commences procedures to
donate communications
equipment to the United Nations
for use by the battalion.

10. Several contingents are unable to
provide sufficient night vision
goggles either on cost grounds or
because of issues concerning
high-technology transfer by other
Member States.

The United Nations commences
procurement action to make up
the shortfalls. While equipment
is not the latest technology, it
conforms to current United
Nations standards and is
operationally satisfactory.



16

A/56/621

Serial Problem Solution Application  to other peacekeeping operations

11. Several contingents request help
with transportation of
contingent-owned equipment,
spare parts and self-sustainment
supplies from home countries.

The United Nations permits
troop-contributing country to
utilize rotation flights to the
maximum of the aircraft’s
otherwise unused cargo capacity.
This allows small quantities in
the order of 2-3 tonnes per
aircraft to be transported at no
additional cost to the United
Nations. A troop-contributing
country request to rotate troops
by ship under a letter of assist at
no additional cost to the United
Nations is assessed as
operationally satisfactory and
accepted. The troop-contributing
country uses the opportunity to
induct significant quantities of
contingent-owned equipment and
other supplies.
