Financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration
in East Timor

Financial performance report of the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor for the period
from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 and proposed budget of
the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions*

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the
Secretary-General on the financial performance of the
United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET) for the period from 1 July 2000 to
30 June 2001 (A/56/922) and the proposed budget of
the proposed successor mission, the United Nations
Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 (A/56/932).

2. UNTAET was established by the Security Council
in its resolution 1272 (1999) of 25 October 1999 for an
initial period until 31 January 2001. By its resolution
1338 (2001) of 31 January 2001, the Council extended
the mandate of UNTAET until 31 January 2002,
stressed, among other things, the need for a substantial
international presence in East Timor after
independence and requested the Secretary-General to

make detailed recommendations in that regard within
six months of the adoption of the resolution. On 31
January 2002, by its resolution 1392 (2002), the
Council decided to extend the mandate of UNTAET
until the date of independence, 20 May 2002.

3. The Secretary-General has outlined plans for the
successor mission to UNTAET in a number of reports
to the Security Council, the latest of which is contained
in document S/2002/432 and Add.1 (see also
S/2001/719, S/2001/983 and Corr.1 and S/2002/80 and
Corr.1). In his report to the Council, the Secretary-
General proposed a mandate for the mission, as well as
a comprehensive mandate implementation plan for the
United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
(UNMISET) (S/2002/432, paras. 64 and 69-98). The
proposed budget of UNMISET (A/56/932) is based on
that plan and on the assumption that the Council would
approve the plan, establish UNMISET and entrust it
with the mandate outlined in the report of the
Secretary-General to the Security Council. The
Advisory Committee notes that the Security Council
has yet to consider the Secretary-General’s proposal.
The Committee considered the proposed budget of

* The performance report for UNTAET and proposed
budget for UNMISET were considered by the Advisory
Committee on 9 and 10 May 2002 on the basis of advance
texts in English. The Advisory Committee’s draft report
was approved by it on 16 May 2002 and sent for
processing on that date.

UNMISET on the basis of the above assumption and
on the understanding that should modifications be
made pursuant to decisions of the Security Council,
the Secretary-General would report to the General
Assembly no later than September 2002.

Financial performance report for
the period from 1 July 2000 to
30 June 2001

4. By its resolution 55/228 A of 23 December 2000,
the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $563
million gross ($546,051,600 net) for the operation of
UNTAET for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June
2001, inclusive of the amount of $292,069,000 gross
($283,688,500 net) authorized by the Assembly in its
resolution 54/246 C of 15 June 2000. As indicated in
the report of the Secretary-General on the financial
performance of UNTAET (A/56/922, para. 12),
expenditures for the period totalled $527,587,900 gross
($513,143,900 net), inclusive of $191,803,400 in
unliquidated obligations. In addition, budgeted
voluntary contributions amounting to $60,000 were
provided during the reporting period. The resulting
unencumbered balance of $35,412,100 gross
($32,907,700 net) represents, in gross terms,
approximately 6 per cent of the appropriation.

5. As indicated in annex II to the performance
report, the unutilized balance was attributable primarily
to reduced requirements under civilian personnel,
premises/accommodation, infrastructure repairs,
transport operations, naval operations, communications
and other equipment, offset in part by additional
requirements for consultants, general temporary
assistance, air operations, supplies and services and air
and surface freight.

6. The Advisory Committee points out that although
the underexpenditure of $35,412,100 represents 6 per
cent of the appropriation for the period, taken together
with the $29.4 million reduction in the original
estimate of $592.4 million (see A/55/443 and Corr.1-
3), recommended by the Committee in its report of 30
October 2000 (A/55/531, para. 62), the percentage of
originally requested resources that were not required
amounts to approximately 11 per cent. In this
connection, the Committee has noted a number of
weaknesses related to budget formulation and
implementation, as indicated below.

7. Additional information provided to the
Advisory Committee shows instances of
shortcomings in the monitoring and recording of
expenditures by the Secretariat. For example, the
Committee notes, in particular, that overexpenditures
under military personnel for standard troop cost
reimbursement ($2,594,300) and clothing and
equipment allowance ($299,500) relate to excess
obligations of $2.7 million and $310,000 respectively,
which was revealed after the completion of
comprehensive adjustments and revisions in troop
strength reports relating to the previous financial
period and the 2000/01 period. The Committee has
commented on the need to improve the process of
compiling and reporting on troop strength in its general
report on peacekeeping operations (A/56/887, para.
32).

8. The Advisory Committee is also of the view
that the $19,024,000 shown in paragraph 15 (b) of
the performance report as other income for the
cancellation of prior period obligations indicates a
tendency to obligate funds without an adequate
analysis of the need for such obligations.

9. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
cash position of UNTAET as at 29 April 2002
amounted to $176.2 million and that unliquidated
obligations for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June
2001 as at 31 March 2002 amounted to $81.5 million,
of which $70.6 million was Government-related and
$10.9 million was not. The Committee was also
informed that the total amount assessed on Member
States in respect of UNTAET since its inception
amounted to $1,281.3 million, and that, as at 30 April
2002, payments received totalled $1,180.3 million, or
approximately 92 per cent of the amount assessed. The
Committee recalls that as at 30 June 2001, unliquidated
obligations amounted to $109.8 million. One year later,
the amount of unliquidated obligations still stands at
$81.5 million, despite the fact that the cash position of
UNTAET is so favourable.

10. It appears to the Advisory Committee that the
processing of liquidations for UNTAET takes an
unduly long period of time, indicating a need to
improve the process of reviewing and paying claims.
This process should include both troop-contributing
countries and the Administration. In this
connection, the Committee recalls the
recommendation of the Board of Auditors in its
report on United Nations peacekeeping operations



3
A/56/945

that the Administration intensify its efforts to
address the delays in processing and certifying
claims for payment to troop-contributing
countries.1

11. The Advisory Committee was further informed
that an amount of $208.7 million had been reimbursed
for troop costs to troop-contributing countries for the
period from 1 February 2000 to 31 January 2002, and
that $14.6 million was owed for the period from 1
February to 31 March 2002. In respect of death and
disability claims, as at 31 March 2002 an amount of
$769,503 had been paid for 23 claims for the period
ending 30 June 2002, unliquidated obligations
amounted to $3.7 million, and 58 claims were pending.

12. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at
29 April 2002, only $16.6 million had been reimbursed
for contingent-owned equipment for the period ending
30 June 2002, while an estimated amount of $158.3
million was owed. Upon enquiry, the Committee was
informed that this was due to delays in the signing of
memorandums of understanding. The efficiency of the
processing of claims for contingent-owned
equipment needs to be improved.

13. As indicated above, the performance report
shows instances of substantial under- and
overexpenditure. In the opinion of the Advisory
Committee, the explanations as to the reasons
therefor are not always satisfactory. Both under-
and overexpenditures point to the need for better
planning and, in some cases, improved efficiency in
procurement and contract management. In
connection with the latter, the Committee was
informed, for example, of an underexpenditure of
$154,400 under alteration and renovation of premises
owing to the non-implementation of three planned
projects. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed
that the bidding and contracting processes could not be
completed on time and that the projects were therefore
not implemented. The Committee was also informed of
an overexpenditure of $578,800 under premises and
accommodation for maintenance supplies, but no
adequate explanation was provided in the performance
report.

14. In connection with procurement, the Advisory
Committee notes that the unutilized balance of
$6,010,300 under communications was due largely to
the cancellation of the procurement of 1,100 mobile
asset locator units for UNTAET vehicles (see

A/56/922, annex II, para. 26). Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that the implementation of
the system had been abandoned because a pilot project
had shown it to be very expensive. In this connection,
the Committee recalls that the same thing had
happened in the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea (see A/56/887/Add.9, para. 18). In the
opinion of the Committee, an adequate evaluation
of the need for the system, as well as a market
survey and technical assessment, should have been
completed prior to a request being made for funds
to implement the project.

15. The Advisory Committee notes that the unspent
balance of $12,366,600 under civilian police was
attributable largely to lower average deployment of
personnel during the reporting period, coupled with a
reduction in the mission subsistence allowance rate
from $109 to $95 per day effective 1 February 2001
(see A/56/922, annex II, para. 6). Savings of
$6,775,100 under international and local staff were due
primarily to a lower average grade level of
international staff than was budgeted, higher than
estimated vacancy rates for local staff (the average
vacancy rate was 11 per cent, whereas a vacancy factor
of 5 per cent had been budgeted) and lower
requirements for common staff costs for mission
appointees, offset in part by additional requirements for
consultants, general temporary assistance and official
travel.

16. As indicated in the performance report (A/56/922,
annex II, para. 11), total requirements for general
temporary assistance for the period amounted to
$1,503,100 against an apportionment of $60,000. The
Advisory Committee was informed that the
overexpenditure of $1,443,100 was related to the
employment of 880 short-term staff (365 security
guards, 265 cleaners and 250 other building
maintenance workers) to provide services to premises
in Dili and in the 13 districts.

17. Under consultants, against the apportionment of
$200,000, total requirements amounted to $3,087,000.
The overexpenditure of $2,887,000 related to the hiring
of 98 consultants in various fields of expertise in
support of the East Timor Transitional Administration
and UNTAET (ibid., para. 10). In addition, the
overexpenditure of $1,217,800 under mission
subsistence allowance includes $937,800 for the
payment of mission subsistence allowance to
consultants (ibid., para. 12). The total requirements for



4
A/56/945

contractual services amounted to $7,294,200, against
an apportionment of $6,730,800; additional
requirements of $563,400 related to the settlement of
$1.7 million in outstanding charges related to the
1999/2000 financial period and to catering services for
a 200-person transit camp, as well as medical treatment
and services, data-processing services and bank
charges (ibid., para. 31).

18. The Advisory Committee is of the view that
the overexpenditure cited above could have been
avoided through better budget preparation. In this
connection, the Committee recalls its comment in its
general report on peacekeeping operations, in which
it drew attention to the fact that, even though the
General Assembly authorized the Secretary-
General to exercise flexibility in implementing the
overall budget of peacekeeping missions, that
flexibility must be exercised in a manner that does
not call into question the basis on which the initial
estimates were prepared and submitted to the
Assembly (A/56/887, para. 19).

19. The treatment of staff costs in both the
performance report (A/56/922) and the proposed
budget (A/56/932) should be reviewed to ensure that
the procedures followed conform to United Nations
practice. Staff costs for posts in UNTAET have been
charged to various objects of expenditure, including
general temporary assistance, consultants and
contractual services, as well as to international and
local staff salaries. The Committee points out that
this practice weakens internal control and
complicates accounting and reporting. The use of
general temporary assistance for ongoing functions
is a departure from the purposes for which it is
intended, namely, to handle brief periods of peak
workload and to replace staff on maternity and sick
leave. Similarly, consultants are to provide specific
expertise that is not otherwise available through the
use of United Nations staff within a prescribed time
frame.

20. The Advisory Committee notes the
overexpenditure of $1,057,200 for official travel
(A/56/922, annex II, para. 13). The amount of travel
undertaken during the reporting period appears to
the Committee to be excessive, especially travel
from Headquarters (see also para. 48 below).

21. The Advisory Committee notes the
underexpenditure of $1.9 million for United Nations

Volunteers (ibid., para. 14), owing to the slower than
expected deployment of Volunteers, resulting in an
average vacancy rate of 32 per cent. In view of the
fact that the use of United Nations Volunteers is
resorted to precisely when there is a need to deploy
quickly, the delayed deployment should have been
explained fully.

22. The Advisory Committee notes the considerable
underutilization of flying hours reported for both
helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Of a total of 13,875
planned hours for 22 helicopters, actual hours flown
totalled 12,381 for 21 helicopters, representing 89 per
cent utilization of planned hours; of 4,500 planned
hours for five fixed-wing aircraft, a total of 3,146 hours
were flown, representing 70 per cent utilization (ibid.,
paras. 21-22); (see also para. 44 below).

23. The action to be taken by the General Assembly
in connection with the financing of UNTAET for the
period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 is indicated in
paragraph 15 of the performance report. The Advisory
Committee recommends that the unencumbered
balance of $35,412,100 gross ($32,907,700 net) for
the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, as well
as interest and other income in the amount of
$29,140,000, be credited to Member States in a
manner to be determined by the General Assembly.

Information on performance for the
current period

24. The Advisory Committee was provided with
expenditure data for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30
June 2002 (see annex I). As at 31 March 2002,
expenditure for the period amounted to $401,154,900,
against an apportionment of $455,000,000 (excluding
provisions for the support account for peacekeeping
operations and the United Nations Logistics Base at
Brindisi, Italy).

25. The Advisory Committee was also provided with
information concerning positions encumbered as at 30
April 2002, which is set out in the accompanying table.

Cost estimates for the period from
1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003

26. As indicated in the proposed budget of the United
Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (A/56/932,
para. 1), estimated requirements for the Mission are
based on the mandate implementation plan for the
successor mission, as outlined in the report of the
Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 17
April 2002 (S/2002/432 and Add.1) and on the
assumption that the Security Council would approve
the plan, establish UNMISET and entrust it with a
mandate as described in the report (see also para. 3
above and A/56/932, paras. 5-13). Accordingly, as
indicated in paragraph 3 above, the present report of
the Advisory Committee is based on the same
assumption.

27. The proposed mandate of the United Nations
Mission of Support in East Timor is: (a) to provide
assistance that is crucial for the stability of East Timor
and the viability of its emergent public administration;
(b) to assist in the development of a law enforcement
agency in East Timor operating in accordance with
international human rights standards; and (c) to
contribute to the maintenance of external and internal
security (see S/2002/432, para. 64). The Secretary-
General also proposes a mandate implementation plan
consisting of three key programmes: stability,
democracy and justice; internal security and law
enforcement; and external security and border control
(ibid., sect. III.A). The Mission would ensure that all

operational responsibilities were fully devolved to the
East Timorese authorities through a phase-out process
to be carried out over a two-year period (ibid., annexes
I-IV).

28. The proposed budget for the operation of
UNMISET for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June
2003 amounts to $318,490,200 gross ($309,254,400
net), inclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in
kind in the amount of $60,000. This amount represents
a 30-per-cent decrease ($136.6 million) in gross terms
in relation to the apportionment of $455 million
approved by the General Assembly in its resolution
56/249 of 24 December 2001 for the operation of
UNTAET for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June
2002. The proposed budget reflects decreases of
$63,143,500, or 32 per cent, in military personnel
costs; $56,810,800, or 35.6 per cent, in civilian
personnel costs; $11,965,800, or 14.3 per cent, in
operational requirements; $1,305,100, or 74.1 per cent,
under other programmes; and $3,344,600, or 26.6 per
cent, under staff assessment (see A/56/932, paras. 2
and 3 and table 1).

29. The Mission would be headed by the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, assisted by a
Deputy Special Representative who would also be the
Resident Coordinator of the United Nations
Development Programme in East Timor. The Mission
would include civilian, police and military
components. The headquarters of UNMISET would be
located in Dili, with regional offices to be maintained
in Dili, Baucau, Oecussi, Maliana and Suai. Liaison
offices in Denpasar and Jakarta and the
logistical/administrative rear base in Darwin, Australia,
would also be maintained. The Office of the Special
Representative would include focal points for gender
affairs and HIV/AIDS. The civilian component would
comprise a group of experts to provide assistance to the
emergent Government (the Civilian Support Group), a
Serious Crimes Unit and a Human Rights Unit (see
ibid., para. 13).

30. The Advisory Committee commends the
Secretariat and UNTAET for the efforts they have
made to formulate an implementation plan and an
exit strategy. In this connection, the Committee
recognizes the difficult circumstances under which
the budget for UNMISET has been prepared.
Nevertheless, it is of the opinion that more could
have been done to translate the implementation
plan set out in document S/2002/432 and Add.1 into



6
A/56/945

an operational budget. For example, the Committee
notes that the estimates contain no overall plan for
the drawdown of civilian staff.2 In this connection,
the Committee recalls its previous comment that the
provision of detailed plans to the Security Council
does not obviate the need to fully justify resource
requirements in documentation submitted to the
General Assembly (A/56/7/Add.8, para. 6).

31. The proposed budget for the downsizing of the
peacekeeping force in four phases over two years,
ending in June 2004. The budget period under review
would cover two phases, which reflect the phased
reduction of the military component from 5,000
personnel, including 120 military observers, in July
2002 to 3,870 personnel by December 2002 (A/56/932,
para. 11). Upon request, the Advisory Committee was
provided with details concerning the planned
deployment of military personnel for the period from 1
July 2002 to 30 June 2003 (see annex II below and
S/2002/432, annex IV). The Committee notes from the
report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council
that the target strength of the East Timor Defence
Force is 1,500 regular soldiers, supported by a reserve
of a further 1,500 (see S/2002/432, para. 23).

32. Initially, the civilian police component would
comprise 1,010 personnel, to be gradually reduced to
500 by the end of the budget period, with the
progressive development of the East Timorese Police
Service (see A/56/932, para. 10 and annex I.C, para. 9,
and S/2002/432, annex III).

33. The estimated requirement of $102,770,800 under
civilian personnel costs represents a decrease of
$56,810,800, or 35.6 per cent, as compared with the
apportionment for UNTAET for the period ending 30
June 2002 and provides for a total of 1,673 civilian
personnel (455 international staff, 977 local staff and
241 United Nations Volunteers), which is a reduction
of 2,258 posts (755 international staff, 1,044 local staff
and 459 United Nations Volunteers) as compared with
the current authorized level for UNTAET (see
A/56/932, table 1 and sect. VIII).

34. The Advisory Committee stresses the
importance of the conclusion of a formal agreement
between the United Nations and independent East
Timor with respect to the expectation that the
Mission would end as proposed by the Secretary-
General and approved by the Security Council. In
this connection, the Committee was informed that

two agreements were under preparation, on the
executive police function and on the peacekeeping
military function, to be signed upon independence
on 20 May. The Committee welcomes this
development.

35. The proposed establishment of the Civilian
Support Group, comprising 100 experts/advisers who
would provide support and guidance to the Government
in such areas as financial and central services, internal
systems in various ministries, essential services and the
legal/justice systems is explained in paragraphs 8, 28
and 29 of the proposed budget. The Civilian Support
Group is to comprise 8 United Nations Volunteers and
92 experts at a cost of approximately $12.9 million.

36. Of the 92 experts/advisers, 24 are included in the
cost estimate for consultants at an estimated cost of
$3.6 million, and 68 are included under general
temporary assistance at an estimated cost of $9.1
million. The Advisory Committee was informed that
the estimated cost of the 8 United Nations Volunteers
was $252,300. Five of the experts are to be co-funded
by the International Monetary Fund. While the
Committee considers appropriate the funding of
experts under the budget item for consultants, it
questions the use of general temporary assistance
funds, which are intended to be used for periods of
peak workload and for the replacement of staff on
maternity and sick leave (see para. 19 above).

37. The Advisory Committee notes from the report of
the Secretary-General to the Security Council that the
recruitment of the 100 experts/advisers for the Civilian
Support Group is under way (see S/2002/432, paras. 71
and 72). The Committee was informed that 66
candidates had been identified for recruitment. Upon
request, the Committee was provided with a list of
functional titles and indicative levels of the
experts/advisers (see annex III).

38. The establishment of an office comprising one P-
4, two P-3 and one General Service (Other level) posts
is proposed to manage the Civilian Support Group (see
A/56/932, paras. 8 and 29 and annex V.A). The
Advisory Committee questions the necessity of
establishing a special unit within UNMISET to
manage the Civilian Support Group.

39. The Advisory Committee notes that the increase
in the staffing of the Serious Crimes Unit, the Public
Defender’s Office and Special Panels (formerly the
Serious Crimes Unit) from 24 to 60 posts would reflect



7
A/56/945

the consolidation of judges, prosecutors, public
defenders and other specialists working on serious
crimes into one group (see ibid., paras. 24 and 27). A
description of the progress of work of the unit is given
in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security
Council (S/2002/432, paras. 34 and 35). The
Committee commends the Mission for its
achievements in this area and requests that an
assessment of lessons learned be made for the
benefit of other missions.

40. The Advisory Committee recommends that the
Mission begin work as soon as possible on lessons
learned, and suggests that, in addition to the
assessment to be made in connection with
paragraph 39 above, areas to be looked at could
include gender mainstreaming and preparations for
handing over public information activities.

41. The Advisory Committee notes that the staffing
of the Human Rights Unit is to be reduced from 58 to
30 posts, and that the Unit is to have field presence.
Proposed activities of the Unit are outlined in the
report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council
(see A/56/932, para. 24 and S/2002/432, para. 67).

42. The authorized staffing of the Division of
Administration of UNTAET for the current period is
2,449. The administrative component of UNMISET,
proposed at 1,321 (see A/56/932, sect. VIII), appears
to the Advisory Committee to be unduly large and
should be reviewed so as to achieve greater
efficiency.

43. Upon enquiry concerning the proposed increase
of 43 United Nations Volunteers for the Division (ibid.,
paras. 21 and 34), the Advisory Committee was
informed that this was related to the withdrawal of the
Force Logistics Squadron provided by the Australian
contingent, comprising 145 personnel. The Committee
is of the opinion that, in a mission that is
downsizing, such withdrawal of personnel could
have been compensated for without additional
personnel.

44. With regard to air operations, the Advisory
Committee observes that the proposed changes in the
aircraft fleet are minimal. For the current period, the
UNTAET fleet consists of 21 helicopters and 4 fixed-
wing aircraft; the proposal for UNMISET is for 19
helicopters, to be reduced to 17 for the period from
January to June 2003, and 2 fixed-wing aircraft (see
ibid., annex I.C, para. 30). The Committee was

provided with details concerning air operations costs
and estimated flight hours for both UNTAET and
UNMISET (see annex IV). The Committee
recommends that, in order to maximize efficiency,
the composition of the air fleet, including the need
for heavy-lift capability, be kept under review. In
addition, in view of the underutilization of flying
hours consistently reported for UNTAET (see para.
22 above), the Committee is of the opinion that the
estimate for air operations ($43,069,800) could be
adjusted downward.

45. The proposed vehicle fleet for UNMISET is 950
United Nations vehicles and 1,257 contingent-owned
vehicles (see A/56/932, annex I.C, para. 27). It appears
to the Advisory Committee that the ratios used by the
Mission to determine the size of fleet needed have
resulted in the excessive retention of vehicles. The
estimate for transport operations ($5,088,700) could
therefore be adjusted downward.

46. The Advisory Committee notes that the estimate
of $209,000 for training of 192 Mission personnel (see
ibid., para. 46) represents an increase of 68 per cent
over the provision for UNTAET for the period ending
30 June 2002. In this connection, the Committee
questions such an increase and recalls its statement
in its general report on peacekeeping operations
that it remained concerned about what appeared to
be unwarranted overexpenditure in training
activities in some missions, even in cases where the
mission should begin to plan to downsize (A/56/887,
para. 74).

47. The Advisory Committee notes that an amount of
$685,400 is estimated for other travel (see A/56/932,
annex II.A, item 18). Bearing in mind its comments
on the performance report in paragraph 18 above,
the Committee expects that strict controls will
result in savings.

48. The Advisory Committee notes that, travel costs
for civilian police are estimated at $2,250 per one-way
trip (see ibid., item 2). The performance report for
UNTAET for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June
2001 showed that travel costs for civilian police had
been overestimated for the period. According to the
additional information provided to the Committee, the
actual cost of one-way travel was $1,045. This
expenditure should be carefully monitored.

49. The Advisory Committee also notes that
estimated requirements for data-processing services



8
A/56/945

have increased substantially, from $20,833 per month
to $37,167 (see ibid., item 49). The reasons for this
increase should be provided to the Fifth Committee.

50. The estimate for communications costs has
increased from $3.9 million to $4.1 million (see ibid.,
annex I). Within that estimate, the cost of a new
transponder lease is estimated at $15,417 per month
(ibid., annex II.A, item 45). The Advisory Committee
requests that clarification of that requirement be
provided to the Fifth Committee. Also under
commercial communications, local telephone charges
have increased from $1,677 to $12,000 per month.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the
item had previously been underbudgeted.

51. The Advisory Committee notes that the estimate
for hire/charter costs under naval operations has
increased from $1.09 million to $1.10 million, owing to
a change in contract (ibid., item 43). Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that the previous vendor had
reneged on services and that the contract had had to be
cancelled. The Committee enquired as to whether any
penalty had been incurred, but received no clear
answer. The Committee requests that this
information be provided to the Fifth Committee.

52. The action to be taken by the General Assembly
in connection with the financing of UNMISET for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 is indicated in
paragraph 4 of the proposed budget. Taking into
account its comments and observations in the
present report, in particular paragraphs 38 and 42
to 47, the Advisory Committee recommends the
appropriation and assessment of an amount of $292
million gross for the operation of UNMISET for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003, subject to
a decision of the Security Council regarding the
mandate of the Mission. The recommended amount
reflects a reduction of 8 per cent of the amount
proposed by the Secretary-General. The Committee
also recommends approval of the use for UNMISET
of the special account established for UNTAET.

Session, Supplement No. 5 (A/56/5), vol. II, chap. II,

2 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed
that implementation plans were under preparation for the
Serious Crimes and the Human Rights Units.
