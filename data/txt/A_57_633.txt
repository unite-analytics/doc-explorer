Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the note by the Secretary-General on the financial arrangements for the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) for the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 (A/57/619). During its consideration of the note, the
Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided
additional information.

2. As indicated in paragraph 1 of the Secretary-General’s note, pursuant to
General Assembly resolution 56/251 B of 27 June 2002, the question of the
apportionment of the balance of the appropriations for UNAMSIL in the amount of
$167,369,100 was left to be considered in connection with possible adjustments to
the Mission’s military and civilian components.

3. As indicated in paragraph 3 of the note by the Secretary-General, based on
Security Council resolution 1436 (2002) of 24 September 2002 and the current
status of expenditures for UNAMSIL, expenditures for the period from 1 July 2002
to 30 June 2003 are estimated at $602,912,100 and the related staff assessment
income at $6,293,700. In paragraph 4 of his note, the Secretary-General requested
that the amount of $100,804,800 be apportioned among Member States for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. The Advisory Committee ascertained that
this amount was arrived at by deducting the unutilized balance of $66,564,300 gross
for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 from the $167,369,100 balance left
to be assessed.

4. The Advisory Committee points out that a brief note such as that
contained in A/57/619 is not sufficient to justify an assessment of more than
$100 million. The Committee requested detailed information on financial
performance and expenditures, but in the short time available it was not
possible to provide material that was of use to the Committee. The Committee
stresses that future submissions must be accompanied with full supporting
detail and justification. Under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee
recommends an assessment of $90 million.
