Preface

1. The major functions of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions, as defined by the General Assembly in its resolution 14 (I) of
13 February 1946, are:

budgets of the specialized agencies and proposals for financial arrangements with
such agencies;

(d) To consider and report to the General Assembly on the auditors’ reports
on the accounts of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies.

The Advisory Committee also reports on the financing of peacekeeping operations,
the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda. In addition, the Committee reports on administrative budgets
and other matters to the governing bodies of the United Nations Development
Programme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Population
Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (voluntary
funds), the United Nations Environment Programme (Environment Fund), the
United Nations Human Settlements Programme, the United Nations Institute for
Disarmament Research, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, the
United Nations University, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees in the Near East.

2. Under rule 156 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the
members of the Advisory Committee, no two of whom shall be nationals of the
same State, shall be selected on the basis of broad geographical representation,
personal qualifications and experience.

3. The Advisory Committee has the following membership:

Vladimir V. Kuznetsov (Chairman)

4. The present report contains the conclusions and recommendations arrived at by
the Advisory Committee on the basis of the Secretary-General’s proposals for the
programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, supplemented, to the extent
possible, by additional information supplied orally or in writing by representatives
of the Secretary-General. As in the past, provision is made in certain sections of the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 for expenditures to which
some Member States have objections in principle. At the same time, the Committee
considered that the controversy concerning such items did not fall within the
province of the Committee, which, under rule 157 of the rules of procedure, is
responsible for expert examination of the programme budget of the United Nations.

Chapter I
General comments, observations and recommendations

1. For the biennium 2006-2007, the Secretary-General proposes a programme
budget in the amount of $3,803,788,900 for the expenditure sections and
$464,458,400 for the income sections (at 2006-2007 rates).1 On a net basis, the
estimates total $3,339,330,500. The General Assembly, in its resolution 59/278 on
the budget outline, invited the Secretary-General to prepare his proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 on the basis of a preliminary
estimate of $3,621,900,000 at revised 2004-2005 rates.

2. In table 1, the estimates for 2006-2007 (at 2006-2007 rates) are compared with
the revised estimates for 2004-2005, as approved by the General Assembly in its
resolution 59/277, and with final expenditure and income for the biennium 2002-
2003. The increase in the expenditure estimates for 2006-2007 as compared with the
revised estimates for 2004-2005 is 5.4 per cent.

Net 2 539 073.0 3 164 322.0 3 339 330.5 216 221.5 6.8

3. The extrabudgetary resources that are likely to be available to the Organization
in the coming biennium are estimated at $5,631,120,100. They comprise
$883,675,400 for support activities, $1,676,666,100 for substantive activities and
$3,070,778,600 for operational activities (see A/60/6, Introduction, table 1). The
grand total, including the net estimate for the regular budget, would therefore be
$8,970,450,600.

4. The estimates do not include the cost of peacekeeping operations or the
International Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The Advisory
Committee was informed that for the periods from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 and
1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, the estimates for peacekeeping operations, excluding
the costs of special missions covered under the regular budget, would total nearly
$8 billion.

5. The revised appropriations for 2004-2005 for the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (see
General Assembly resolutions 59/273 and 59/274) total $585,227,400 gross
($529,943,500 net).

A. Format and presentation of the proposed programme budget

6. The format of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007
remains basically unchanged from that of 2004-2005. In accordance with the terms
of General Assembly resolution 58/269, the programme narratives of the budget
fascicles are identical to those in the biennial programme plan.2 As indicated in
paragraph 43 of the Introduction to the proposed programme budget (A/60/6
(Introduction)), there are no new or revised mandates that would result in
differences between the biennial programme plan as adopted by the General
Assembly and the programmatic aspects of the proposed programme budget for
2006-2007, with the exception of section 33, relating to the newly established
Department of Safety and Security, for which there is currently no separate
programme in the biennial programme plan. While in the past, security matters were
reflected under programme 24, Management and support services, and programme
26, Jointly financed activities, the related programme narratives for safety and
security in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 are
presented under a new programme, Safety and security (see A/60/16, paras. 62-27).
Under the terms of General Assembly resolution 58/269, the new programme on
safety and security was submitted to the Committee for Programme and
Coordination for its consideration during its session held at Headquarters from
6 June to 1 July 2005.3

Presentation of the logical framework

7. The Advisory Committee notes the progress that has been made in the
presentation of the logical framework. However, despite those efforts, the
Committee notes that many of the comments and observations on outputs,
expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and objectives made in its
report on the proposed programme budget for 2004-2005 are still valid. It is
still difficult to ascertain the extent to which the outputs contribute to the
attainment of the objectives and expected accomplishments for each of the
subprogrammes. Moreover, an attempt should be made to specify the resource
implications of the outputs (see paras. 15 and 23 below). The Committee points
out that, in many cases, it is still not possible to determine what the
consequential impact on expected accomplishments would be if some outputs
were not implemented. Such a linkage is one of the basic requirements of the
logical framework. There is also a need, in the view of the Committee, to
identify outputs mandated by legislative bodies (non-discretionary outputs) and
those initiated by the Secretariat (discretionary outputs) (see also para. 16
below).

8. The Advisory Committee reiterates its view about the importance of fine-
tuning the definition of terms and guidelines as the Organization acquires more
experience in applying results-based budgeting (see A/55/543, para. 12). An effort
should be made to simplify the logical framework while taking care to reflect
the specificities of particular activities. The Committee is of the view that the
definition of an “output” requires further refinement since the term comprises
practically all activities of the Organization, whether they are substantive or
support functions; continuing services or one-time action; easily measurable or
difficult to quantify. There should also be uniform application Organization-



5
A/60/7

wide of the term “output”, thus ensuring compatibility among the departments
and offices of the Organization.

9. The Advisory Committee believes that a distinction should be made
between outputs of substantive areas and support services. The way results-
based budgeting is applied to support and administrative functions is not very
helpful. Rather than focusing on vague and subjective indicators of
performance such as the percentage of respondents expressing satisfaction in
client surveys or the percentage of offices reporting, effectiveness should be
illustrated by workload benchmarks for comparison with industry standards.
Information on efficiency gains in support services should also indicate one-
time projects and the time frame for their implementation.

10. In its report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the
United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/59/736), the Advisory Committee made
a number of comments and observations that apply equally to the proposed
programme budget of the United Nations. In particular, the Committee called for
improving the measurability of indicators of achievement and outputs as well as the
setting of time frames for implementation to facilitate monitoring and reporting.
Moreover, the Committee emphasized the importance of developing links
between the financial systems and the programme monitoring systems, which is
an essential element of results-based budgeting.

11. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that indicators of achievement
and performance measures need to be presented in a quantifiable and more
transparent and consistent manner. For example, the performance measure
“amount of efficiency gains resulting from business process improvements” for the
expected accomplishment “improved business processes” is not specific enough, nor
does it permit an understanding of what improvements should be implemented in
business processes so that efficiency gains can be achieved; moreover, while the
performance measure “percentage of offices in the Secretariat reporting efficiency
gains” is quantitative, it leaves a lot of room for interpretation since it does not
provide for the measurement of efficiency gains, but simply indicates the number of
offices reporting efficiency gains. Furthermore, the percentage of expenditure
compared to funds available is given as an indicator of achievement for “efficient
and effective use of resources” or in a few cases for “full and efficient utilization of
resources”, with a target of 100 per cent for 2006-2007. In this connection, the
Committee points out that the “full” utilization of resources alone is not
necessarily indicative of their efficient and effective use; what is important is
not whether the money was spent, but how it was spent in attaining targets
within mandated programmes. A more appropriate indicator in this case could
be a reduction of delays in processing funding for approved purposes or a
reduction in the number of negative or critical audit observations on the
administration of funds. Furthermore, it is important that indicators of
achievement be realistic and, indeed, achievable.

12. The application of regulation 5.6 of the Regulations and Rules Governing
Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of
Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8) is discussed in
paragraph 16 of the Introduction to the budget. The Secretary-General reports that a
total of 3,019 outputs will be discontinued in 2006-2007, reflecting the outcome of a
review of the outputs delivered in 2004-2005. The Advisory Committee was



6
A/60/7

informed that 2,006 of those outputs related to the category of completed or non-
recurrent outputs. The Committee recalls that a total of 912 outputs were proposed
to be discontinued for the biennium 2004-2005. In that connection, the Committee
notes the Secretary-General’s statement in paragraph 3 of the Introduction that “in
the forthcoming biennium growth in priority areas would in very large part be
funded through the reallocation of resources”.

13. The Advisory Committee also notes that the budget document identifies
weaknesses and inconsistencies encountered by the Secretariat in the application of
regulation 5.6, including the categorization of outputs, the treatment of changes in
output quantities from one biennium to the next and the identification and treatment
of non-recurrent outputs. Annex III to the Introduction of the budget provides
information on the identification of activities and outputs that have been completed
or are obsolete, of marginal usefulness or ineffective.

14. The Advisory Committee welcomes the progress achieved and the efforts
to identify outputs that would be discontinued in 2006-2007. At the same time,
the Committee notes the limited and inconsistent compliance with regulation 5.6, in
particular the absence, in a number of sections of the budget, of any
recommendations for the deletion of outputs or reference to an analysis explaining
why no such outputs were identified.

15. The information on the discontinued outputs as initiated by the
Secretariat or as mandated by the legislative bodies could also have been more
useful if the budget document had identified those new outputs and activities
that are being proposed in lieu of activities and outputs proposed for
termination. Similarly, the Advisory Committee is of the view that where
discontinued outputs are not to be specifically replaced by proposed new
outputs, attempts should be made to identify the quantum of resources to be
made available for redeployment as a result of the proposed termination of
activities and outputs (see para. 23 below).

16. Moreover, the Advisory Committee recognizes the distinction that should
be made between the outputs that were originally initiated by the Secretariat
(discretionary outputs) and those that were originally mandated by legislative
bodies (non-discretionary outputs). As indicated in paragraph 28 of annex III to
the Introduction, the termination, curtailment or modification of non-discretionary
activities or outputs, in the vast majority of cases, requires prior approval by the
intergovernmental body that made the request. The Committee was informed, upon
enquiry, that in the context of budget preparation, the legislative bodies listed in
table 2 had received and reviewed advance copies of the programmes of work within
the area of their substantive responsibilities.

17. The Advisory Committee has consistently called for greater participation
of the programme-formulating bodies in the programme-planning process. The



8
A/60/7

Committee reiterates its position that the General Assembly needs to be able to
rely on the contribution of the specialized bodies to review and refine or
reformulate the programme of work; the work of the specialized bodies is
critical for the implementation of results-based budgeting and it is those
specialized bodies that are most qualified to determine whether the activities
they had initially authorized for inclusion in the proposed programme budget
are producing the intended results (see para. 44 of the Committee’s first report
on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-20054).

18. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that intergovernmental bodies
of the United Nations need to pay increased attention to all stages of
programme planning and implementation and to participate closely in the
identification of activities and outputs that are obsolete, of marginal usefulness
or ineffective. Moreover, the extent of participation of the intergovernmental
bodies in formulating programmes related to activities funded from the regular
budget of the United Nations should be clearly identified in the programme
budget.

19. The Advisory Committee finds the presentation of external factors in
many cases to be vague or of doubtful relevance. For example, objectives stated
in many budget fascicles are expected to be achieved subject to full cooperation on
the part of “stakeholders”, by which the Secretariat very often means its
departments, offices and divisions. In this regard, the Committee reiterates its
previous observation that cooperation among units of the Secretariat should be a
given; any indication to the contrary would point to management problems. The
Committee also recommends that in future budget submissions the term
“stakeholders” be spelled out and not be considered as an external factor if it
refers to the organizational entities of the United Nations.

20. The Advisory Committee notes that significant changes have been introduced
in programme planning by the General Assembly and other intergovernmental
bodies; these need to be reflected in the regulations and rules to give clear guidance
on results-based budgeting as it stands today. For example, the term “performance
measure” is not defined in the programme planning regulations. The Committee
therefore recommends that consideration be given to updating the Regulations
and Rules Governing Programme Planning (last issued in 2000) with a view to
reflecting all the changes in the process of programme planning, monitoring
and evaluation that have been enacted by the General Assembly.

21. In this connection, the Advisory Committee stresses that it is of
fundamental importance that the basic terms employed in results-based
budgeting and the roles and responsibilities of all involved in the process be
fully and precisely defined. There is also a need to pursue a coordinated United
Nations system approach to definitions of basic terms related to results-based
budgeting techniques. The Committee was informed that work had commenced
in this regard within the relevant structures of the United Nations System Chief
Executives Board for Coordination.

22. The Advisory Committee is of the view that the successful implementation
of results-based budgeting requires increased attention to expected
accomplishments before, during and after budget implementation. The
Committee recalls that the shift from input budgeting to programme budgeting
was initiated in 1974 in order to provide Member States with a full description



9
A/60/7

of the activities of each organizational unit of the Secretariat and of the
resources required for the delivery of outputs. This has not, however, led to a
reduced focus by the General Assembly on input control at a detailed level.
While such detailed attention to input may enforce a measure of control with
respect to resources, it does not enable Member States to determine whether or
not the programme outputs are effective in meeting the objectives of the
programme.

23. The issue of how to quantify the resources devoted to outputs has, in one form
or another, been around for many years. For its part, since the 1970s the Advisory
Committee has consistently indicated that any system to be developed must be cost-
effective and easy to maintain. Most recently, the Committee for Programme and
Coordination, in paragraph 349 of its report on its forty-fourth session,5

recommended that the Secretary-General develop improved tools for identifying the
cost of activities and outputs and report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth
session on options for applying cost-accounting techniques drawing on best
international practices (see also General Assembly resolution 59/275 and decision
59/549). A statement of the programme budget implications of those
recommendations was submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/59/13, para. 5).
The development of cost-effective and easy-to-maintain cost-accounting systems
could facilitate analysis of the cost of activities, including the related resources
that could be released as a consequence of the discontinuation of outputs.

24. The Advisory Committee emphasizes that intensified commitment is
required to avert the risk of results-based budgeting becoming a paper exercise.
Indicators of achievement and performance measures often appear to be
written to meet the requirements of the budget process rather than to reflect
the management plan of the entities involved. The Committee points out that
results-based budgeting is not an end in itself. Up to now, the main emphasis
has been on creating and refining that mechanism. In the opinion of the
Committee, the time has come to begin using results-based budgeting to
improve both management and accountability in the Secretariat as well as to
allow the General Assembly to shift its attention to policy-setting and to focus
on the results to be expected from the investment of the required resources. The
Committee cautions that without an effective system for programme planning,
monitoring of programme budget implementation and evaluation and
performance reporting (see para. 29 below), these intended shifts will be
compromised.

Monitoring and evaluation and management reviews

25. Pursuant to paragraph 20 of General Assembly resolution 58/269, the proposed
programme budget identifies within each section resources related to monitoring
and evaluation. The Secretary-General acknowledges that except for departments
and offices in which there are identifiable monitoring and evaluation functions for
which specific resources are allocated, the identification of resources for those
functions has proven to be a difficult exercise (see A/60/6 (Introduction), para. 49).
Table 3, provided by the Secretariat, indicates, in a consolidated format, resources
related to monitoring and evaluation.

26. The Advisory Committee points out that not all budget sections contain
information on resources related to monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, according
to the clarification provided to the Committee upon enquiry, resources for
monitoring and evaluation that have been included in the budget sections represent,
in most cases, very approximate and predominantly notional requirements. In the
opinion of the Committee, the intent of the General Assembly in making its
request was to elicit clear information on the evaluation and monitoring
functions. The information provided does not appear to meet the expectations
of the Assembly, since there is little or no description of how the evaluation and
monitoring functions are being carried out. The Committee trusts that the
presentation will be improved and that in future the budget submissions will
include information on the effectiveness of the Organization’s investment in
monitoring and evaluation.

27. The Advisory Committee was informed that the resources shown in table 3
reflected by and large requirements for self-monitoring and self-evaluation. While
encouraging self-monitoring and self-evaluation as valuable tools in the
implementation of results-based budgeting and lessons learned, the Committee
emphasizes the continued importance of independent monitoring and
evaluation functions, such as those carried out by the Office of Internal
Oversight Services, as a source of objective analysis of the achievements and
shortcomings of United Nations programmes and activities. It is important that
the roles and responsibilities of the various organizational units vis-à-vis
monitoring and evaluation, as well as self-monitoring and self-evaluation, be
clearly assigned and delineated. It should also be emphasized that a large part
of the regular budget is devoted to administrative and support functions. For
those, the absence of quantified means of assessing efficiency and productivity
is a serious shortcoming that must urgently be overcome. The Committee
intends to discuss these issues with the Office of Internal Oversight Services
when it takes up its revised programme budget proposal.

28. Management reviews are an important tool to ensure that work programmes
are administered and implemented with efficiency. Upon enquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that, while programmatic reviews were made in the
process of preparing the budget, comprehensive management reviews had not been
undertaken by most entities for the past several years. The Committee welcomes
programmatic reviews, especially if their results are timely and can be taken
into account during the preparation of a proposed programme budget. It also
believes that comprehensive management reviews should be conducted on a
periodic basis, particularly when there is a shift in the organizational
environment, a change in the mandate or a variation in the level of resources
available.

Performance and reporting

29. The Advisory Committee recalls its observation made in its first report on the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-20054 that no effective
mechanism exists to monitor, evaluate and measure the results and impact of the
programmes and activities of the United Nations, nor does there exist the necessary
financial link to programmes and activities. The Committee also pointed out that the
investment in technology and staff training already made and to be made in the short
and long term should be exploited more fully in order to remedy those deficiencies.



12

A/60/7

Only by making progress in this area would programme managers be able to fulfil
the goal embodied in the results-based-budget framework and would Member States
be able to receive timely and accurate data and information when decisions are
being taken (see A/58/7, paras. 14 and 15). The Committee points out that
tangible results have still not been achieved.

30. The Advisory Committee requested information on the further development of
the Integrated Monitoring and Document Information System (IMDIS) and the
extent to which programme managers could obtain information from existing
systems in order to monitor implementation and performance and ensure the
systematic entry of data. The Secretariat has acknowledged that a new version of
IMDIS should be developed in consultation with programme managers to increase
their use of it as a management and monitoring tool.

31. The Advisory Committee recalls that it had previously commented extensively
on the need for the further development of IMDIS (see A/58/7, paras. 10-13). The
Committee also recalls that enhancement of IMDIS was planned for the biennium
2004-2005 whereby user departments and offices would be able to access financial
data generated by the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) in IMDIS;
it appears that the enhancement has not been accomplished. Moreover, the
Committee has been informed that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
which has provided the bulk of support to the development and operation of IMDIS,
has indicated that it will likely reduce its support in favour of other priorities. The
Committee is concerned that this will result in the elimination of an existing
user-friendly performance monitoring system. Instead of relying on the
resources of one department — the Department of Economic and Social
Affairs — with sporadic contributions from the Office of Programme Planning,
Budget and Accounts and the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the
Committee urges that increased attention be paid to the development of IMDIS
and requests that the Secretariat report on progress in this area in the context
of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Furthermore,
the Committee recognizes that the qualitative emphasis of programme
evaluation should complement the quantitative focus of IMDIS; due care
should be taken by programme managers to ensure that specific qualitative
data are introduced to the system.

32. On a related matter, the Advisory Committee recalls that it was the Secretary-
General’s intention to eventually integrate the report on programme performance
into the report on accomplishments, which, together with information on
expenditures, would provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the outputs
delivered, the accomplishments achieved and the resources utilized. The Secretary-
General has also indicated that the report on accomplishments would be used to
increase the accountability of programme managers in the implementation of the
programmes (A/54/456, paras. 39 and 40). The Committee points out that the
declared intention has not materialized, although the issue is being reviewed in the
context of the preparation of the programme performance report for 2004-2005 (see
A/60/6 (Sect. 29), table 29.16).

33. In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, more should be done to provide
it with the most up-to-date financial information and other relevant statistics.
Given the investments of the Organization in technology and in training of
staff, performance data should cover, as a rule, the period ended 31 March of



13

A/60/7

the second year of a biennium. The Committee is also of the view that the lead
time in the budget preparation cycle, which is approximately 15 months before
the start of the next biennium, is far too long. The Committee recommends that
a thorough analysis be undertaken of the current budget practices with a view
to minimizing the lead time.

34. The Advisory Committee notes that a number of budget fascicles contain
information on the implementation of recommendations of the Committee and
oversight bodies that pertain to specific budget sections. The Committee believes
that it would also be beneficial for the Secretariat to address the cross-cutting
issues contained in chapter I of the Committee’s reports on the proposed
programme budgets. The Committee requests that, in future, action taken on
such recommendations as may have been approved by the General Assembly be
reported in a separate annex.

B. Methodology

35. As indicated in paragraph 27 of the Introduction to the budget, the
methodology used to prepare the financial requirements remains unchanged from
that used for the current biennium, as endorsed by the General Assembly in its
resolution 47/212 A of 23 December 1992. The proposed budget includes a
provision of $59.6 million related to the delayed impact of costing new posts
approved in 2004-2005 and a provision of $4.5 million for the delayed impact of
non-post-related security provisions that had previously been budgeted for only the
second year of the biennium 2004-2005; the proposed budget also reflects a
deduction of one-time costs of $87.9 million approved for 2004-2005. In addition,
resources in the amount of $356 million are included for special political missions,
reflecting the resource level approved for the maintenance of such missions as from
December 2004. Additional requirements for special political missions, should they
become necessary, will continue to be subject to the provisions of General Assembly
resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986.

36. The Advisory Committee points out that a number of developments since
1994, including the growth of special political missions and requirements for
special conferences and for security, call for refinements in the methodology
now being used. Moreover, the introduction of results-based budgeting
presupposes a shift of focus on the part of Member States from input analysis to
review of results and expected accomplishments (see para. 24 above). As such,
the presentation of budget and financial data to the General Assembly must be
clear and transparent in order to avoid an inordinate amount of time being
spent on trying to fully understand the data. While the Committee does not
recommend a return to the complex methodology of the past, it is of the opinion
that thought should be given as to how best to update the current methodology.

37. In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes the statement in paragraph
13 of the Introduction that “total positive real growth at the section level amounts to
$50.1 million for 20 sections, which is balanced by reductions of $49.8 million in 13
sections, resulting in a net additional appropriation request of $276,600”; this is
equivalent to an increase of less than 0.1 per cent in real terms (ibid., para. 6). The
term “real growth” is also used in a number of other places in the Introduction (see,
e.g., para. 3). The Committee observes in this connection that the concept of real



14

A/60/7

growth, as used in programme budgeting until 1994, is no longer applied and
the use of that term should be avoided unless accompanied by the related
analysis, which not only provides for the deduction of one-time costs of the
previous biennium, but also adds the delayed impact of new proposals adopted
during the biennium in progress.

38. The treatment of what is called the “maintenance base” is another matter
that requires further refinement and clarification. As currently used, the
maintenance base is simply equated to the level of the revised appropriation
approved by the General Assembly at the end of the first year of the biennium
in progress. However, such a simplified treatment may not reflect the effect of a
number of variables, such as non-recurrent items, and the delayed impact of
new additions to the budget for the biennium in progress. Moreover, the
Advisory Committee has noted an attempt to consider the maintenance level as
the totality of resources that have already been accepted and therefore as a
base; the Committee points out that the Assembly has never adopted a purely
incremental approach and that all resources must be justified.

39. Another area where refinement is necessary is the treatment of special political
missions. On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee in paragraph 23 of its
first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003,6

starting in the biennium 2004-2005, the undistributed provision for special political
missions has been treated as recurrent. The Committee notes, however, that in the
various tables that contain information on requirements by object of expenditure,
amounts relating to special political missions are included under “other expenses”,
thus distorting the analysis of individual objects of expenditure and giving the
appearance that the requirements under those objects of expenditure that relate to
special political missions are, in fact, non-recurrent. The Committee notes, for
example, that travel of staff shows a decrease of 33.4 per cent in comparison with
2004-2005, which the Committee was informed was due largely to the non-recurrent
nature of the travel requirements for special political missions. After the deduction
of all non-recurrent requirements, the actual overall decrease for travel amounted to
only $768,600, or 1.8 per cent (see para. 89 below).

40. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with a notional
projection of requirements for special political missions for the biennium 2006-2007
by object of expenditure (see table 4). Given the magnitude of the provision for
special political missions, the Committee believes that a methodology is now
needed to more accurately reflect the recurrent nature of the individual objects
of expenditure within the provision so that proper analysis can be undertaken.
The Committee trusts that the proposed programme budget for 2008-2009 will
take this into account.

41. The Advisory Committee observes that while supplementary information
is provided to it containing limited data on the costing standards and unit rates
used during the preparation of the budget for replacement of personal
computers (at all duty stations) and printers (at Headquarters only), no
information is provided on costing standards and unit rates for supplies and
materials, furniture and maintenance of office automation equipment. The
Committee believes that such information should be provided to it together
with a full justification of the standard costs and unit rates that are already
being used in the cost estimates.

C. Cooperation and coordination

42. The Advisory Committee points out that the various departments of the United
Nations Secretariat, the regional commissions, the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the funds and programmes have built
independent in-house capacity in such areas as statistics, analysis and information
technology systems. This has resulted in overlap and duplication of effort and
processes. The Committee believes that greater effort should be exerted to
foster deeper cooperation and coordination across the United Nations system
with a view to bringing about synergy, enhancing complementarity and
removing avoidable redundancies. The fact that some of these entities have
their own intergovernmental bodies for policymaking and guidance does not
preclude the harmonization of efforts in areas of common interest. The
Committee therefore recommends that, in future, information be provided on
the extent, forms and results of cooperation among the various structures of the
United Nations system on activities implemented by more than one
organizational unit. Particular attention should be paid to reflecting



16

A/60/7

cooperation among such entities as the Department of Political Affairs, the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Safety and
Security or UNCTAD, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the
regional commissions to avoid overlap or duplication of effort. The Committee
has commented in detail on this, where relevant, in chapter II below.
Furthermore, the Committee is of the view that future budget submissions
should clearly indicate the role and contributions of other programmes, funds
and agencies in the implementation of specific outputs.

D. Personnel matters

43. The staffing resources available for carrying out the work programme of the
Organization include established posts, temporary posts, temporary assistance,
contractual services, consultants and ad hoc expert groups and overtime; these
resources are financed from the regular budget and from extrabudgetary funds.

44. For the biennium 2006-2007, the cost of posts is estimated at $1,970,219,700
(at 2006-2007 rates) and other staff costs at $197,816,900, for a total of
$2,168,036,600 (excluding staff assessment) under the expenditure sections. If the
estimate under income section 3, Services to the public, of $28,954,100 for posts
and other staff costs is added, the total amounts to $2,196,990,700.

45. The cost of extrabudgetary posts (including related other staff costs) is
estimated at $2,168,149,600, including staff financed from the support account for
peacekeeping operations. It can thus be said that personnel costs to be financed from
the regular budget and extrabudgetary resources would amount to an estimated
$4,365,140,300 in 2006-2007.

46. Statement V of the financial statements of the United Nations for the biennium
ended 31 December 20037 indicates that out of total expenditure of $2,964.6
million, some $2,300.2 million, or approximately 77.6 per cent, related to salaries
and common staff costs.

47. The Advisory Committee points out that, as can be seen from the figures
cited in the preceding paragraphs, staff costs represent by far the largest share
of the proposed programme budget. For this reason, as well as the fact that the
proposed budget represents limited growth in comparison with the previous
biennium, the efficient and effective management of human resources takes on
even greater importance. Moreover, during the course of the Committee’s
budget review, a number of important human resources-related issues arose.
Accordingly, the Committee has devoted considerable attention to the matter in
the present report.

48. The Advisory Committee has always striven to make specific
recommendations in clear language. Accordingly, it has attempted to address a
number of human resources issues by providing very specific, unambiguous
recommendations. While understanding that political realities may require
them to be altered during the deliberations of the General Assembly, the
Committee trusts that the essence of its recommendations will provide an
impetus for positive change.

49. In recent years, the Advisory Committee has noted, with increasing
concern, a blurring of the lines between the policy-setting role of the General



17

A/60/7

Assembly and the administrative responsibilities of the Secretary-General.
Indeed, the Committee recalls that in paragraph 8 of its first report on the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 1998-19998 it expressed its view that there was
a danger that the balance between the role of the Secretariat and the various organs
of the United Nations, as embodied in the Charter, would not function as intended.
At that time the Committee recalled the Secretary-General’s proposal that the
General Assembly review the current distribution of functions and responsibilities
with a view to restoring the balance that was envisioned when the Organization was
established (see A/51/950, para. 48).

50. The effective functioning of the Organization requires that the respective
responsibilities be understood and respected. It is the prerogative of Member
States to make policy, confer mandates, specify results desired and allocate
resources. The Advisory Committee emphasizes that the Secretariat’s proper
role is to execute the policies adopted by Member States; it should not attempt
to legislate its own policy directives (see, for example, A/59/736, para. 32). Its
impartiality and competence are of fundamental importance, consistent with
Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations (see General Assembly
resolution 59/266, sect. II, para. 1). For his part, the Secretary-General — if he
is to be held accountable — has the responsibility to use the means he considers
best suited for implementing those mandates conferred upon him. In the
opinion of the Committee, the Secretary-General should exercise his authority
under the Charter as chief administrative officer of the United Nations; such a
step would lessen the tendency for the General Assembly to “micromanage”
and would also better enable the Assembly to focus on policy issues.

51. The Advisory Committee comments in detail on the role of the Department of
Management in chapter II, section 28A below. As for the particular role of the
Office of Human Resources Management, the Committee reiterates that it
should be kept in mind that the Office provides support to managers in
carrying out the substantive work of the Organization; its goal should be the
placement, based on merit, of qualified personnel where needed as
expeditiously as possible, guided always by the policies adopted by the
Organization, including geographical distribution and gender balance, as well
as the encouragement of staff and career development so that the Organization
can achieve the maximum benefit from its human resources (see A/59/446,
para. 4). The Committee makes reference below to the difficulties described
during its hearings, especially in the areas of recruitment and placement of
staff. The Committee notes a tendency by the Office to initiate complex, often
piecemeal, solutions to old problems, with the net effect that personnel
management in the Organization has become so convoluted that very few
managers actually understand how the system works. The time dedicated by
managers to unravelling the intricacies of the system and the frustration they
experience at the inability to control this key aspect of their function are
indications of serious deficiencies in personnel management. The time thus
wasted, if it could be quantified, could well represent a substantial loss of
managerial resources, which, in turn, could have a significant budgetary and
financial impact. The Committee intends to take up human resources
management comprehensively at the sixty-first session of the General
Assembly, including the issues raised below, on the basis of its consideration of
the relevant reports of the Secretary-General.



18

A/60/7

Management of the Secretariat as a whole

52. In its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-
2005,4 the Advisory Committee stressed the need to manage the Secretariat as a
whole. In response, the General Assembly, in paragraph 14 of its resolution 58/270,
decided, on an experimental basis, to make up to 50 posts Organization-wide
available for redeployment. In the first performance report on the programme
budget for the biennium 2004-2005, it was reported that it had not been possible to
identify any surplus staffing resources within a particular programme that were
available for redeployment to another programme (A/59/578, para. 53).
Subsequently, in a note by the Secretary-General (A/59/753), it was reported that 5
posts had been identified for redeployment on a permanent basis and that 12 would
be redeployed between sections under temporary administrative arrangements to
meet immediate needs by utilizing vacant posts pending completion of the
recruitment and placement processes. While the Advisory Committee welcomes
these developments, it expresses its disappointment that the directives set out in
resolution 58/270 have not been more fully implemented. The Committee sees
the 50-post redeployment flexibility as a sort of pilot project meant to further
the establishment of ways and means to manage the Secretariat as a whole.

53. The Advisory Committee continues to discern a lack of central direction
in the management of the staffing table. Resource planning in the Secretariat
should be undertaken on an Organization-wide basis to make judgements on
new needs and challenges that must be responded to and on opportunities for
redeployment. The responsibility for this should be clearly defined. The
Administration has not fully exercised its authority to manage the utilization
and deployment of the staffing resources Organization-wide. The Committee is
of the view that the staffing table of the Secretariat will need to be administered
with considerably greater flexibility and creativity if the Organization is to
respond to new challenges. The Committee reiterates its contention that
departments do not “own” particular posts at particular grade levels and, in
this regard, again stresses the need to view the allocation of posts as dynamic,
rather than static (see A/59/601, para. 22).

54. The Secretary-General is entrusted, under Article 97 of the Charter, with
the role of Chief Administrative Officer of the Organization. Although General
Assembly resolution 51/226 may be interpreted by some as limiting the
authority of the Secretary-General, the Committee finds nothing in that
resolution which is inconsistent with the Charter. The Secretary-General must
be willing to exercise his authority to administer the staff of the Organization,
and the departments subordinate to him must accede to that authority. The
Committee therefore urges the Assembly to strengthen the Secretary-General’s
role as Chief Administrative Officer by granting him the flexibility necessary to
effectively manage the staff and other resources of the Organization and by
encouraging him to fully utilize his authority, it being understood that all
personnel actions must be consistent with the Staff Regulations and that any
which have financial implications should be treated in accordance with the
Financial Regulations.

55. In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls paragraph 35 of General
Assembly resolution 57/300 by which the Assembly, inter alia, took note of the
request of the Secretary-General in his report entitled “Strengthening of the United



19

A/60/7

Nations: an agenda for further change” (A/57/387 and Corr.1) for a degree of
flexibility to reallocate resources between programmes and between allocations for
personnel and other allocations within a single budget period and in exceptional
circumstances. The Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to develop
criteria for the use of any such authorization, propose modalities for reporting the
duration and programmatic impacts of reallocations, including specification of the
exceptional circumstances in which the authority would be used, and to report
thereon to the Assembly, through the Advisory Committee, for its consideration at
its fifty-eighth session. In paragraph 13 of its resolution 58/270, the Assembly
reaffirmed those provisions. The requested report should be provided to the
Assembly at the main part of its sixtieth session, in time for its consideration in
conjunction with the proposed programme budget.

Accountability

56. The Advisory Committee notes with interest that the Secretary-General has
undertaken a number of initiatives designed to deal with the matter of accountability
in the Secretariat. Among these are:

(a) The establishment of a Management Performance Board to assess the
performance of senior managers;

(b) The establishment of an Oversight Committee for the Secretariat to
ensure that appropriate management action is taken to implement the
recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of
Auditors and the Joint Inspection Unit;

(c) The issuance of a whistle-blower policy;

(d) The preparation of recommendations to expand the scope of financial
disclosure required of senior officials;

(e) The preparation of a comprehensive anti-fraud and corruption policy.

The issue of accountability has been of long-standing concern to the Advisory
Committee; however, until and unless there are sanctions in place for failure to
perform, such measures will have no real impact. The Committee recalls, in this
connection, that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to
enhance managerial accountability “with respect to human resources management
decisions, including imposing sanctions in cases of demonstrated mismanagement of
staff and wilful neglect of, or disregard for, established rules and procedures”
(resolution 59/266, sect. I, para. 14).

57. It strikes the Advisory Committee that the notion of sanctions should be
broadened to apply not only to human resources decisions, but also to
performance as a whole in accordance with results-based-budgeting principles.
If sanctions are to be imposed, they must first be defined. In this connection,
the Committee points out that the idea of sanctions has been referred to
frequently over the years as the means by which accountability is enforced;
however, without concrete measures, little or no progress will be made. In the
opinion of the Committee, there should be a whole range of specific
disincentives for failure to perform satisfactorily, up to and including dismissal,
as well as incentives for excellent performance. The Organization now finds
itself in a position where, through the proper application of the Performance



20

A/60/7

Appraisal System, it has the tools to measure performance against specific
benchmarks and goals; it is the view of the Committee that the time has come
to move away from theoretical to practical application of results-based-
budgeting principles and truly performance-based management. The
Committee makes a number of suggestions below that can be seen as first steps
and that are not all-inclusive. For example, the question of dismissal and/or the
non-renewal of contracts can be discussed further in the context of the
consideration of the administration of justice and related issues. As indicated in
paragraph 51 above, the Committee intends to address this issue
comprehensively during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.

58. The Advisory Committee was informed that performance compacts, which
include an annual commitment to the Secretary-General to achieve measurable goals
with regard to various programmes and management objectives, particularly with
respect to human resources planning, have been introduced for Under-Secretaries-
General. Upon its request for a sample compact, the Committee was informed that
they were confidential. In the first place, as the goals presumably tie in with the
objectives and expected accomplishments that form the basis of the proposed
programme budget, the Committee questions whether it is wise to insist on
confidentiality vis-à-vis Member States and the Secretariat itself. In fact, if
accountability is a serious goal, it would seem to make sense to make such
commitments known. Second, the Committee is of the view that such compacts
should be extended to the Assistant Secretary-General level and that a specific
set of sanctions (up to and including termination of employment) should be put
in place to deal with failure to perform or poor performance, bearing in mind
that Under-Secretaries-General and Assistant Secretaries-General are engaged
by means of letters of appointment for specific periods.

59. At the United Nations, for the most part, the personnel responsible for
managing day-to-day operations in the Secretariat are senior staff at the D-1 and
D-2 levels, who, in many cases, hold permanent contracts. As things now stand,
when such staff fail to perform they either remain in their position or there is a
prolonged effort to place them in another job at the same level. The Advisory
Committee recommends that consideration be given to instituting an
arrangement in the United Nations by which managers at the D-1 and D-2
levels are no longer assured of retaining their grade if they fail to perform
satisfactorily. In this scenario, the P-5 level would be considered the base level
for managers; managers at the D-2 and D-1 levels who failed to perform
satisfactorily could be placed in another position at a lower level, down to D-1
or P-5. A similar system could apply to levels P-5 and below, where the base
level could be P-3.

60. Conversely, provisions should be put in place to reward staff whose
performance exceeds expectations; a staff member who shows unusual promise
or leadership qualities should not be impeded by age or seniority. The Advisory
Committee recalls section I, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 51/226, in
which the Assembly expressed regret concerning the unsuccessful efforts to develop
a management environment and culture in the Organization that would enable staff
members to contribute their maximum potential, effectiveness and efficiency. It
appears to the Committee that that observation remains valid today, more than
eight years later. In the opinion of the Committee, measures should be put in
place to provide the necessary flexibility to accelerate the promotion of



21

A/60/7

deserving staff, which would reinvigorate the Organization. In this connection,
the Committee notes the pay-for-performance pilot project being carried out by
the International Civil Service Commission. It should also be pointed out that
to the extent that managers are truly held accountable for their performance,
they must also be given the authority necessary to manage effectively.

61. In a related matter, the Advisory Committee notes an increasing trend in
the Secretariat to appoint deputies to senior managers. The Committee believes
that the addition of an intermediate bureaucratic layer is undesirable in most
cases and views this as symptomatic of a tendency to avoid hands-on
management, which can only exacerbate the feeling of disconnection between
staff and management. Moreover, it also dilutes the direct accountability and
personal responsibility of the most senior managers.

Staff selection, recruitment and placement

62. In the course of its discussions on the proposed programme budget, the
Advisory Committee heard many complaints regarding the staff selection system
from managers throughout the Secretariat. These range from delays relating to the
required translation of vacancy announcements (in at least one case, more than 70
days) to a lack of procedures for dealing with advertising in advance for vacancies
likely to result from internal promotion. The Committee notes that the effort to
empower programme managers in the selection of staff has been coupled with
cumbersome provisions for ensuring transparency, including a time-consuming
reporting process. While the Committee believes that a means for ensuring
transparency is important, more practical and realistic reporting requirements
would, in fact, create an incentive for managers to fully comply with what is
requested of them.

63. In this connection, the Advisory Committee requested clarification of the
figures provided in section 28C, tables 28C.6 and 28C.9, of the proposed
programme budget on recruitment time lines. The Committee was informed that the
average number of days a post remains vacant in departments and offices in New
York is estimated at 410 days for 2004-2005 and that the target for 2006-2007 is 350
days. The Committee was further informed that the average number of days a post
remains vacant is a measure of the time between the separation of a staff member
and the assumption of duty by his/her successor. The Committee requests that a
uniform standard for measuring recruitment time lines be applied throughout
the Secretariat.

64. Over the years, the Advisory Committee has been provided with many
statistics regarding the length of time required for recruitment. Sometimes the
criteria for measurement change, but they have all pointed to the simple fact that it
takes too long to fill vacancies at the United Nations. The Committee believes that
bold action is necessary to break this long-standing impasse. It therefore
recommends imposing a requirement that all posts which become vacant as the
result of planned retirements must be filled within 30 days; otherwise the
programme manager involved should be held accountable and his or her
performance should be evaluated accordingly. Succession planning is a serious
problem, and managers will have to begin the recruitment process well in
advance of a planned retirement. As for other vacant posts and new posts, the
Committee expects more rapid progress towards the approved target of 120



22

A/60/7

days. If this is achieved, delayed recruitment factors will need to be reviewed.
The Committee recalls, in this connection, that as far back as 1997 the General
Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to instruct all programme managers
to inform the Office of Human Resources Management of all vacancies immediately
and of all foreseen vacancies six months before the posts become vacant (resolution
51/226, sect. III.B, para. 11).

65. One way for managers to shorten the selection process is to have recourse to
the roster of candidates who have been endorsed by a central review body but who
were not selected for the post for which they applied. Such candidates may be
placed on a roster, valid for one year, for future vacancies with similar functions at
the same level. Should an eligible roster candidate be suitable for a vacancy, the
programme manager may recommend his or her immediate selection without
reference to the central review body. The Advisory Committee considers the
roster as one important tool to expedite the staff selection process, as it
provides a way for full advantage to be taken of the work done by the Office of
Human Resources Management, programme managers and the central review
bodies, as well as the resources expended, for each vacancy. Moreover, with its
potential to shorten and simplify the recruitment process, the roster system
provides an incentive for managers to look outside their circle of professional
acquaintances at qualified (and vetted) candidates, and likewise provides
candidates with the opportunity to be truly considered for positions for which
they are qualified; this will have added importance if the staff mobility
programme is implemented as planned. In view of the protracted recruitment
process, the Committee is of the opinion that consideration should be given to
the best way of managing the roster, including the time period that candidates
remain on it. The Committee encourages the Secretary-General to address the
roster system in his forthcoming report on efforts to reduce delays in the
process of selection, recruitment and placement of staff to be submitted to the
General Assembly at its sixty-first session pursuant to Assembly resolution
59/266 (sect. II, para. 4). In this connection, the Committee reiterates its view
that effective management of such a roster, including the automatic electronic
notification of programme managers concerning eligible roster candidates,
could provide a means for shortening the recruitment time line (see A/59/446,
para. 16).

66. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that a roster
management system was soon to be introduced. Previously, the human resources
case officer for each vacancy was obliged to manually search in the Galaxy
electronic staffing system for relevant rostered candidates. The Committee was
informed that the new system would pull all relevant cases automatically and that
the case officer would make the determination as to similarity of functions. The
Committee trusts that the system will be further refined to make it more automatic
by eliminating the need for the case officer to review the rostered candidates. The
Committee notes with concern that the new staff selection system was put into
place in 2002 without an adequate means of handling the rosters that were to be
a part of it.

67. Problems with the Galaxy system continue to plague the staff selection
process. Though improvements have been planned since inception of the system, the
Office of Human Resources Management continues to find itself inundated with
more applications for announced vacancies than it can easily handle. The other side



23

A/60/7

of the equation is that users find that applying online through the personal history
profile, which, according to the electronic introduction to the system, should take
approximately 30 to 40 minutes to complete, can require hours of frustrating work.

68. In the context of arrangements for regularizing the budgetary and technical
support for Galaxy and transferring responsibility for the system from the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations to the Department of Management, the
Secretary-General has stated his intention to undertake a review to establish the
most appropriate technological infrastructure for the Galaxy system, including the
possible use of “off-the-shelf” packages to support some of its functions
(A/59/265/Add.1, para. 7). In this connection, the Advisory Committee reiterates
its recommendation that lessons learned with regard to Galaxy should be fully
documented and analysed and that the experiences of other large organizations
that have installed similar systems should be reviewed (see A/59/736, para.
120). Given the well-known problems with Galaxy, the Committee welcomes the
intention of the Secretary-General to evaluate alternative electronic staffing
systems.

Staff mobility

69. The Advisory Committee has repeatedly stated its support for the promotion of
mobility of staff as a means to develop a more flexible and multi-skilled workforce.
However, the administrative and financial implications of the reassignment
programme, which will require staff to move every five years beginning in 2007,
have not been addressed. The Committee points out that the proposed programme
budget contains no reference to the cost of this exercise. In this connection, the
Committee notes that the General Assembly, in section VIII, paragraph 5, of its
resolution 59/266, has requested the Secretary-General to develop a strategic plan
with indicators, benchmarks, time lines and clear criteria for the implementation of
mobility policies and to report thereon, including with information on the financial
implications, to the Assembly at its sixty-first session. That report should also
include measures to ensure appropriate monitoring and accountability.

National professional officers

70. In its most recent reports on peacekeeping operations, the Advisory Committee
devoted considerable attention to the need to promote the widest possible use of
national staff at both the Professional and General Service levels (see A/59/736).
The United Nations has an obligation to foster the sustainability of the assistance it
delivers by encouraging the development of national potential and the creation of a
durable human resources infrastructure. The presence of national staff in United
Nations field offices and peacekeeping operations also permits the Organization to
be more sensitive to the capacity-building needs and priorities of the local
population. Although opportunities for the employment of national staff in
regular budget activities are more limited than they are for peacekeeping, the
Committee nevertheless encourages a sustained effort to attract and employ
this category of personnel wherever practical and feasible, such as in the
regional commissions, the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the United
Nations information centres. Activities financed through extrabudgetary
resources, where opportunities may be more prevalent, would also benefit from
this type of outreach.



24

A/60/7

71. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that thought should be given to
authorizing programme managers during the implementation of a particular
budget to flexibly utilize international posts for national officers if they
consider it a more effective means of attaining programme objectives, with
associated savings remaining available to promote programme implementation.
The Secretary-General should report thereon in the next proposed programme
budget.

Regular budget established and temporary posts

72. Under the expenditure sections and income section 3, Services to the public, of
the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, the Secretary-General
requests a total of 9,630 posts. In table 5, the request for 2006-2007 is compared
with the authorized staffing table for 2004-2005.

a Includes a reduction of one post under income section 3.

73. A detailed discussion and comprehensive analysis of the proposed staffing
appears in paragraphs 17 to 26 of the Introduction to the proposed budget. A
summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget posts by
section of the programme budget is contained in table 5 of the Introduction.

74. The Advisory Committee requested information on the total number of regular
budget and extrabudgetary posts authorized since 2000, as well as on the total
number of approved and projected posts in all peacekeeping operations from 2002 to
2006. That information is contained in annex I to the present report. The
Committee requests that, in future, information be provided concerning posts
on loan as well. Annex II contains a list of new and abolished posts by section of
the proposed programme budget.

75. The Advisory Committee found that the budget fascicles and the
supplementary information provided to it offered little justification to substantiate
the creation of new posts or the reclassification of existing posts. During the course
of its hearings, in order to properly consider such requests, the Committee had to
seek additional oral and written information from the Administration. The
Committee underlines that the supplementary information provided to it
should include workload statistics to justify new posts, while changes in the
nature and scope of responsibilities should be indicated to justify the
reclassification of existing posts.



25

A/60/7

76. In addition, the Advisory Committee has noted a tendency for organizational
units to borrow posts and to seek their regularization as new posts. The Committee
stresses that this practice lacks transparency and should be avoided in favour
of straight redeployment. In a related matter, the Committee notes that four
posts have been proposed for redeployment between budget sections for 2006-
2007, as follows:

• One P-5 post to be transferred from section 28A, Office of the Under-
Secretary-General for Management, to section 10, Least developed countries,
landlocked developing countries and small island developing States

• One P-4 post to be transferred from section 10 to section 28A

• Two General Service (Other level) posts to be transferred from section 2,
General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference
management, to income section 3, Services to the public

Annex III contains a list of posts proposed for redeployment; except for the posts
listed above, all are for internal redeployment.

Reclassifications

77. A total of nine posts are proposed for reclassification as follows:

• Two P-5 posts to D-1

• One P-3 post to P-4

• One P-3 post to P-2

• One P-2 post to P-3

• One Field Service post to P-3

• One General Service (Other level) post to P-2/1

• Two Trades and Crafts posts to General Service (Other level)

The Advisory Committee recalls that in its first report on the proposed programme
budget for 2004-2005,4 it made extensive comments on the subject of
reclassification of posts (paras. 68-79). In paragraph 74 of that report, the
Committee recommended that the existing authority for the Secretary-General to
reclassify posts be refined so as to provide the ability to reclassify posts from G-1 to
G-6 and from P-1 to P-5, provided that the overall number of posts in each grade did
not change. Although the General Assembly granted approval for up to 50 posts to
be made available for redeployment Organization-wide (resolution 58/270, para. 14;
see also para. 52 above), the above–cited recommendation of the Committee was not
specifically addressed. The Committee reiterates that recommendation at this
time for the reasons given in its previous report. The observations and
recommendations of the Committee on the reclassification of posts for the
biennium 2006-2007 are contained where appropriate in chapter II of the
present report.

Vacancies

78. Vacancy rates are discussed in paragraphs 31 and 32 of the Introduction to the
budget. As indicated, a uniform rate of 4.9 per cent for Professionals and 1.5 per



26

A/60/7

cent for the General Service and related categories is proposed for continuing posts.
The Advisory Committee notes that an adjusted vacancy rate of 1.5 per cent for
continuing General Service posts is proposed for 2006-2007 (down from 3.8 per
cent in 2004-2005) in anticipation of the lifting of the suspension of recruitment
action for new vacancies in General Service posts (see paras. 79-82 below); as a
result, a provision of $20.8 million is incorporated under recosting.

Staff ratio

79. As shown in table 5 above, approximately 57.8 per cent of regular budget
established and temporary posts requested are in the General Service and related
categories. The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information
provided to it that the General Service and related categories account for 65.8 per
cent of extrabudgetary posts. This compares with 58.7 per cent of regular budget
and 64 per cent of extrabudgetary posts in 2004-2005.

80. By paragraph 25 of its resolution 58/270, the General Assembly requested the
Secretary-General to suspend recruitment action for new vacancies in General
Service posts for the biennium 2004-2005. The reasoning behind the recruitment
freeze was that technological advances had reduced the need for support staff and
that the time had come therefore to reduce the ratio of General Service to
Professional staff. According to the Secretary-General, the proposed abolition of 90
General Service posts in 2006-2007 largely reflects the Organization’s return on
investment in the automation of work processes (A/60/6 (Introduction), para. 21; see
also para. 81 below). The Secretary-General also indicates that the ratio of General
Service to Professional posts will decrease from 1.41 to 1 in 2004-2005 to 1.36 to 1
in 2006-2007 (ibid., para. 22). There has, however, been a downside to the freeze, in
that many departments have reported increasing difficulty in implementing
individual programmes of work as a result of the suspension of General Service
recruitment, as noted in the first performance report on the programme budget for
the biennium 2004-2005 (A/59/578, para. 42).

81. Despite the attribution of reductions in General Service staff to efficiency
gains, the Committee notes that the proposed abolition of General Service posts is
nearly offset by requirements for new Professional posts, many of which are at the
junior Professional levels. While the Committee appreciates the statement that
this demonstrates the “continuing and concrete efforts of the Organization to
revitalize and rejuvenate the Secretariat at the junior Professional levels”
(A/60/6 (Introduction), para. 23), it does not escape the attention of the
Committee that the proposed post abolitions in the General Service category
are nearly cancelled out by the posts to be established in the Professional
category. Similarly, the Committee has noted an increase in extrabudgetary
General Service staff. Although this may not necessarily amount to tactics for
getting around the General Service recruitment freeze, the Committee does not
believe that it is in the best interest of the Organization to hold vacant those
General Service posts which have evolved into an important support function
in some areas. Clearly there is a need for such staff, which is being met in a
variety of ways.

82. While the Advisory Committee firmly believes that there may be some
General Service functions that could be combined or posts that could be
abolished as a result of advances in information technology and measures to



27

A/60/7

reduce duplication and inefficient administrative processes, it is of the view that
the suspension of General Service recruitment across the board may have been
too broad a measure.

83. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that the suspension of
recruitment be lifted. The Committee further recommends that a
comprehensive analysis of the functions performed by the General Service staff
be undertaken with a view to more accurately determining which posts can be
eliminated without detriment to the work of the Organization. This should
form part of the report to be submitted to the General Assembly at the
beginning of its sixtieth session in accordance with section VIII, paragraph 7, of
Assembly resolution 59/276. The Committee notes that the Secretary-General
will also be submitting a report on a time-bound plan for reduction of
duplication, complexity and bureaucracy in United Nations administrative
processes and procedures (see A/59/16, para. 348). The Committee also notes, in
this connection, that the proposed vacancy rates for General Service staff
anticipate the lifting of the suspension (see para. 78 above).

E. Other staff costs, consultants and experts and contractual services

84. The Advisory Committee has been commenting for many years on the
requirement that consultants should be hired only in instances where expertise does
not exist within the staff of the Secretariat. Consultants should be hired for specific
time-limited projects and the existing procedure for evaluating their work should be
strictly followed; this evaluation should be used when deciding upon any future
assignment. These considerations and a number of others are embodied in
administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/7 on consultants and individual contractors,
promulgated pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/221. Nevertheless, the
proper use of consultants requires strengthening of control at the central and
departmental levels, as this is an area subject to misuse and abuse. The
Committee has noted that, in a number of cases, funds for consultants are
simply shifted from one subprogramme to another in the same amount. An
example of this is given in the discussion on the Economic Commission for
Europe, under section 19 of the proposed programme budget (see chap. II, part
V, below). While this may be considered a type of redeployment, it is usually
not explained as such. The Committee emphasizes that resources for
consultants should be determined on a case-by-case basis and limited to specific
activities for which necessary expertise is not available in-house. The
Committee requests that special attention be paid to this matter and that the
United Nations regulations on the use of consultants be applied strictly.

85. As in the past, the Advisory Committee emphasizes that a clear distinction
should be made between resources for consultants and those for expert groups.
Furthermore, care should be taken to distinguish between use of general temporary
assistance and consultancy funds and to ensure consistent application of the
procedures for use of personal service contracts when they are to be financed by
general temporary assistance. Moreover, consultants should not be hired over and
over again for prolonged periods, and functions of a continuing nature should be
accommodated from within the staffing table.



28

A/60/7

86. It has come to the attention of the Advisory Committee that a number of
departments are including requirements, under contractual services or consultants,
for external translation and editing of materials that should ordinarily have been
handled by the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management.
This is ostensibly due to the fact that the Department is so overburdened with
parliamentary documentation that some publications and other materials receive
low-priority treatment; in other cases, departments have missed the “slot” for
processing their material or did not request processing in a timely manner.
Departments have therefore hired their own external translators and editors.

87. In the view of the Advisory Committee, all formal translation of
publications and documents emanating from the United Nations Secretariat
into official languages of the Organization should be handled centrally by the
Department for General Assembly and Conference Management. If it is
perceived that translation is not possible internally within a reasonable time
frame, then there should be recourse to contractual translation through the
Contractual Translation Unit of the Department. The advantages of central
management of contractual translation and related work include economies of
scale relating to the administrative overhead costs, a favourable bargaining
position in contract negotiations with external translators and, perhaps most
importantly, assurance of quality control. The Committee has commented on this
matter in detail in chapter II in the context of its consideration of section 2, General
Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, of
the proposed programme budget.

88. In a related matter, the Advisory Committee is aware of an increased interest
on the part of the Secretariat in outsourcing. Outsourcing can be a useful method of
achieving economies as long as a number of important criteria are met. Among these
are that the activity is not required to be under the direct authority of the Secretary-
General for political considerations or for reasons of confidentiality and/or security
and that quality and timely provision of the service can be assured. Recourse to
outsourcing is governed by the provisions of General Assembly resolution 55/232.
The Committee continues to encourage creative ideas, within those guidelines, on
ways and means of delivering the services required by the Organization.

F. Travel

89. Travel is an area on which the Advisory Committee has commented for many
years, yet it remains an area of concern. Resources for travel of staff, which are
estimated at $28,516,500 (before recosting), show a decrease of $14,273,700, or
33.4 per cent, as compared with 2004-2005 (see A/60/6 (Introduction), table 4). The
Committee was informed that the decrease was due largely to the non-recurrent
nature of the travel requirements for special political missions in 2004-2005. The
Committee recognizes that the provision for special political missions in 2006-2007
is proposed as an undistributed amount. Upon request, however, the Committee was
provided with a notional projection of travel requirements included in the provision
for special political missions, which amounted to $13,771,800 (see table 4 above).
The Committee was informed that after all non-recurrent travel provisions were
deducted, the overall actual reduction under travel of staff was $768,600, or 1.8 per
cent. Travel to be financed from extrabudgetary resources is projected at $136.4



29

A/60/7

million for 2006-2007, an increase in comparison with the $134 million estimated
for 2004-2005.

90. The Advisory Committee has observed from its consideration of the individual
budget sections and its discussions with the representatives of the Secretary-General
that a significant portion of the provision is devoted to travel by senior management.
The Committee firmly believes that senior managers should spend most of their
time at their home duty station managing the day-to-day functions of their
departments or offices. In this connection, the Committee is of the opinion that
there may well be a link between increased travel requirements and the
increased number of requests for deputy posts (see para. 61 above). It is logical
that a need for a deputy begins to be felt if the manager is often away. The
Committee is concerned that travel may have begun to be viewed as a
perquisite of senior management. While the Committee does not deny the
importance that networking and face-to-face consultation have in a global
organization such as the United Nations, it is of the view that travel by senior
managers could be reduced considerably through greater recourse to
videoconferencing and other electronic means of communication wherever
possible.

91. The Advisory Committee notes that the Joint Inspection Unit has issued a
report on the harmonization of travel throughout the United Nations system
(A/60/78). The Committee will take up the matter in the light of the comments of
the Secretary-General on the report, which are to be issued at the end of July or the
beginning of August 2005. The Committee does wish, however, to comment on
recommendation 1 of the Unit, in which it recommends a review of the criteria used
to determine the class of travel of staff members.

92. The Advisory Committee recalls, in this connection, its report on standards of
accommodation for air travel, in which it stated its opinion that the time had come
for a reconsideration of the whole question of first-class travel (A/59/573, para. 10).
The Committee observed that in recent years, many airlines had significantly cut
back, if not entirely eliminated, first-class sections on aircraft, choosing instead to
offer enhanced business-class options. The Committee pointed out further that the
differences in the level of accommodation between those classes appeared to be
minimal. Taking those developments into account, the Committee noted that the
General Assembly might wish to provide further guidance on the use of first-class
travel with a view to its use in only the most exceptional circumstances. The
Assembly took note of the Committee’s report in its decision 59/559. The
Committee trusts that those considerations will be addressed in the review
recommended by the Joint Inspection Unit.

G. Administration of justice

93. In its interim report on administration of justice in the Secretariat (A/59/715),
the Advisory Committee recommended that the Secretariat be authorized, using
existing resources, to proceed with its efforts to eliminate current backlogs in:
(a) conducting administrative reviews in the Office of Human Resources
Management and preparing respondents’ replies to the Joint Appeals Board; (b)
processing and considering appeals in Geneva and Nairobi; and (c) the work of the
Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management related to the administration



30

A/60/7

of justice. The Committee expressed its intention to revert to the matter in the
context of its consideration of the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2006-2007, with the expectation that a progress report would be available at that
time.

94. That plan, however, has been somewhat overtaken by events, in that the
General Assembly, on 13 April 2005, adopted a rather detailed resolution on the
matter (resolution 59/283) in which it, inter alia, decided to form a panel of external
and independent experts to consider redesigning the administration of justice
system, which is to present its findings to the Assembly by the end of July 2006.
Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with a breakdown of the
additional resource requirements for administration of justice, included in the
current estimates for 2006-2007 (see table 6). The Committee’s observations and
recommendations on the estimated resource requirements relating to the
administration of justice are contained in chapter II below, under the relevant budget
sections. The Committee will revert to the matter of administration of justice when
it considers the report of the redesign panel established pursuant to Assembly
resolution 59/283.

H. United Nations common system of salaries, allowances and benefits

95. The Advisory Committee is becoming increasingly concerned about the
disparity among common system organizations in the treatment of entitlements for
staff recruited internationally for service in non-family missions. Many of the
United Nations funds and programmes are moving towards the special operations
approach, under which the staff member and his or her family are installed in an
administrative place of assignment at a location near the non-family duty station.
Such staff receive the normal entitlements associated with the place of assignment,
including post adjustment, mobility and hardship allowance and assignment grant,
as well as a special operations living allowance (which is similar to mission
subsistence allowance) at the non-family duty station. Staff members recruited by
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for assignment to a non-family mission
receive only mission subsistence allowance (in lieu of post adjustment, assignment



31

A/60/7

grant and mobility and hardship allowance), and the family remains in the home
country.

96. The Advisory Committee understands the attraction that the special operations
approach has for the field-based organizations in that it provides a means for staff
members who are required to serve on longer-term assignments in non-family duty
stations to remain close to their families and that it is seen as a way to attract and
retain experienced and high-performing staff. Mission subsistence allowance, on the
other hand, represents the total contribution of the Organization towards the living
expenses incurred by staff who are appointed exclusively for mission service and is
determined on the basis of accommodation, food and miscellaneous expenses at the
duty station. It has the advantage of administrative simplicity, which can be an
important factor when dealing with large numbers of personnel on short notice or
for shorter periods, and can be easily adjusted as prevailing conditions in the
mission area change.

97. Notwithstanding these factors, however, the Advisory Committee is
concerned about the implications that discrepancies in terms and conditions of
employment may have for the morale of staff who are working side-by-side in
the same mission area, as well as about the competition for personnel that this
is likely to engender among the United Nations and its funds and programmes
in the field. The Committee has commented on this matter in its general report on
peacekeeping operations, in which it noted that the special operations approach, in
general, provides for a more generous package of entitlements than are given to
United Nations staff (see A/59/736, para. 63). The Committee therefore
recommends that the General Assembly, when it considers the comprehensive
report on conditions of field service to be submitted to it at its sixty-first session
in accordance with section X, paragraph 6, of Assembly resolution 59/266, give
due consideration to preserving not only the letter but also the spirit of the
United Nations common system of salaries, allowances and other conditions of
service, which was intended, inter alia, to prevent competition for personnel
among United Nations system organizations, facilitate the exchange of staff,
afford economies of scale in the central maintenance of salaries and allowances
and foster a sense of equity among staff working for different organizations in
the same system.

I. Establishment of a reserve fund

98. Paragraphs 35 to 40 of the Introduction to the budget deal with the
establishment of a reserve fund for additional expenditures arising from currency
fluctuation, inflation in non-staff costs and statutory cost increases for staff. The
Secretary-General proposes that the General Assembly approve, in principle, the
establishment of a reserve fund for the biennium 2008-2009 subject to the
procedures outlined in annex II to the Introduction.

99. The Secretary-General indicates that the reserve would be funded from
assessed contributions and replenished through savings due to variations in the
forecast included in the programme budget in respect of currency fluctuations,
inflation in non-staff costs and statutory increases for staff, or through further
assessed contributions, as necessary. As concerns the level of the reserve, the level
of $150 million initially proposed by the Secretary-General (A/44/665) may be



32

A/60/7

considered as a starting point for the reserve fund. Under the procedures for the
reserve fund, in off-budget years the General Assembly would decide on the level of
the fund, which would be included in the proposed programme budget for the next
biennium.

100. The Advisory Committee points out that in the past, it has commented
extensively on the question of additional expenditures deriving from inflation and
currency fluctuations. For example, the Committee, having reviewed the practices of
specialized agencies, concluded that there was an unavoidable cost associated with
mitigating the effects of inflation and currency fluctuation and that the Assembly
might accordingly wish to consider the continuation of the current system, whereby
the estimate of requirements is adjusted annually on the basis of the most recent
forecast by the Secretary-General of inflation and exchange rates (see A/43/929).
Subsequently, the Committee expressed a number of difficulties with the idea of
financing the reserve fund from the outset through assessment, pointing out that it
would not allow Member States a more precise idea of the final total amount to be
paid than was currently the case and, in addition, would result in advance payment
for requirements that might or might not materialize (see A/44/729). The Committee
has also commented recently on the issue of additional expenditures deriving from
inflation and currency fluctuations (see A/57/7/Add.14 and A/58/7 and Add.5).

101. The Advisory Committee reiterates its past position on the matter and, at
this stage, recommends the continuation of the current system, whereby
requirements are adjusted annually on the basis of the most recent forecast by
the Secretary-General of inflation and exchange rates.

J. Efficiency measures and gains

102. The Advisory Committee was provided, upon request, with information on
efficiency measures introduced by the Secretariat during the past few years that
would have an impact on resource requirements for the biennium 2006-2007. The
Committee had previously commented on this topic in paragraphs 63 to 65 of its
first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.6 The
Committee’s comments and observations on efficiency measures and gains are
reflected under various sections in chapter II below. The Committee points out that
much of the impact of efficiency measures is cost avoidance rather than direct
savings, although some measures would have a direct impact on staff costs and other
resource requirements. The Committee is of the view that considerable
improvements need to be made in reporting on efficiency gains, which should
be based on a well-established methodology, a common approach and
standards, objective measurement tools and identifiable and realistic
benchmarks and time frames. The issue of incentives and disincentives for
programme managers to achieve efficiency gains should also be addressed. The
Committee emphasizes the leading role and responsibility of the Department of
Management in developing a coordinated approach in encouraging and
reporting on efficiency gains. The Committee requests that, in future, a
summary of efficiency measures and gains should be included in the
introduction to proposed programmed budgets and that detailed information
on such measures and gains should be reflected in supplementary information
provided to the Advisory Committee.

A/60/7

K. Extrabudgetary resources

103. Estimates of extrabudgetary resources, which are shown in the regular budget
for information purposes, account for a significant portion of United Nations
expenditures. The bulk of extrabudgetary resources are related to the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Human Settlements
Programme (UN-Habitat) (see table 7).

Subtotal 1 369 602.3 24.3

Total 5 631 120.1 100.0

104. The Advisory Committee reviews and submits reports on the related
administrative budgets to the various programmes mentioned in section A of table 7
(see Preface and para. 121 of the present report). For the most part, the Committee
examines other extrabudgetary resources maintained in special accounts in the
context of its review of the proposed programme budget. The Committee also
receives information biannually on the status of trust funds. Under the terms of
section II, paragraph 2, of General Assembly resolution 35/217 of 17 December
1980, the Committee considers proposals for all new posts at the D-1 level and
above funded through extrabudgetary sources that are not otherwise subject to
scrutiny by an intergovernmental body. The Committee reiterates its position that
all such extrabudgetary posts should be managed with the same degree of care
as is exercised with regular budget posts.

105. As shown in table 7, some $1.37 billion in extrabudgetary resources relates to
technical cooperation, reimbursement and trust funds. The Advisory Committee
notes the information summarized in paragraphs 73 to 75 of the Introduction to the
budget, including the statement that the level of extrabudgetary resources to be



34

A/60/7

received during a biennium and the number of posts to be funded cannot be
determined with complete precision owing to the nature of voluntary contributions.
In a number of instances, the Committee was informed by programme managers that
additional funds were in the pipeline or that pledging conferences were to be held in
the near future. The Committee recalls paragraph 130 of its first report on the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005,4 in which it requested
once again that steps be taken to improve forecasting techniques and recommended
that the Secretary-General, wherever feasible, provide broad explanations of
variances in projected extrabudgetary resources. The Committee notes that the
overview of each budget section contains summary information on extrabudgetary
resources and that, in some cases, that information was expanded to cover
significant factors affecting the estimates for 2004-2005 and 2006-2007. The
Committee trusts that an effort will continue to be made to improve the
accuracy of projections and to provide meaningful explanations of variances in
extrabudgetary resources, both when comparing projections from one
biennium to the next and when analysing the difference between projections
and realized amounts.

106. With the continued increase in extrabudgetary resources available to the
United Nations through voluntary contributions from Governments and the
expanding trend and emphasis on obtaining funding from the private sector,
the Advisory Committee believes that attention must be given to ensuring that
extrabudgetary expenditures are subject to a greater measure of scrutiny and
control. In this connection, the Committee reaffirms the statement it made in a
report to the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session9 that the information
on extrabudgetary resources included in the proposed programme budgets
should be structured in such a way as to permit an examination of the trust
funds and extrabudgetary programmes by the Committee and to enable it to
comment with specificity on proposals related to the administrative and/or
support costs of the activities concerned, including the creation of new posts.
With this in mind, the Committee recommends that the presentation of
extrabudgetary resources be revised, with a view, in particular, to making it
more compatible with results-based-budgeting principles.

107. Particularly in view of the expanded emphasis on obtaining funding from
the private sector, the Advisory Committee believes that it is increasingly
important that the Secretary-General establish that the receipt of the funding
and the utilization of the funds will not in any way alter the priorities
established by Member States in the relevant forums; that United Nations
financial and personnel regulations and rules be adhered to; that, where donors
require additional accountability, documentation and standards be established
for those requirements; and that any additional support costs entailed in
managing the funds be reimbursed on an agreed basis (see A/58/7, para. 133).

108. Posts anticipated to be financed during 2006-2007 from extrabudgetary
resources are summarized in table 2 of the Introduction to the proposed programme
budget. It is estimated that extrabudgetary resources will finance a total of 9,587
posts, as compared with 8,808 for 2004-2005. The total initially estimated for the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 was 7,527 posts. The
Advisory Committee was informed that the total included posts for support services
and substantive activities (including posts financed from operational funds at



35

A/60/7

established United Nations offices and those financed from the support account for
peacekeeping operations).

109. In accordance with the terms of section II, paragraph 2, of General Assembly
resolution 35/217, the Advisory Committee, since submitting its first report on the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005,4 has concurred with the
request by the Secretary-General to establish a D-1 post for the Director of the Latin
American Institute for Economic and Social Planning and an Assistant Secretary-
General post to head the Partnerships Office. The Committee also concurred with
upgrading from the P-5 to the D-1 level five posts of heads of field offices in the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for its operations in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and the regional offices in
Central/East Africa, West Africa and South Asia. The concurrence of the Committee
was also sought for the reclassification of the post of Director of the new
Coordination and Response Division of the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs from D-1 to D-2. In view of the fact that the Division is
responsible for implementing one of the core mandates of the Office, the Committee
recommended that a request for the establishment of a D-2 post of Director under
the regular budget be prepared and submitted.

L. Information technology

110. The proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 includes a
provision of $234.8 million for information technology, an increase of $15.7 million
compared with the current biennium. Information on the distribution of the total
information technology resources of $234.8 million by budget section, as well as the
Secretary-General’s vision for the utilization of those resources during the coming
biennium, is provided in paragraphs 58 to 64 of the Introduction to the budget. The
Secretary-General indicates that proposals for 2006-2007 reflect the increasing
importance of information technology in the work of the Organization and the
resulting investment in information technology within individual budget sections,
often through the reallocation of resources from non-information technology areas.

111. While recognizing the effort that has been made, the Advisory Committee
points out that numerous problems remain to be resolved, such as multiple
database systems that are incompatible with each other; the need to integrate
financial and performance monitoring systems (see para. 10 above); and the
need to eliminate redundancy and duplication while improving business
processes and the reliability of data. Moreover, the concept of results-based
budgeting implies that more attention should be paid to reporting on expected
accomplishments and results to be achieved, and this aspect is missing in
reporting on information and communication technology requirements for the
coming biennium.

112. The Advisory Committee is of the view that the Office of Central Support
Services should play a leading role in the coordination and implementation of
the information and communication technology strategy and that it should
enjoy the strong backing and full cooperation of the Organization’s senior
officials. The Secretariat should pay increased attention to the need to eliminate
duplication and parallelism in such projects. It also needs to take into account
that the requirements for information and communication technology are



36

A/60/7

different in the various units of the Secretariat (see chap. II, sect. 28 D below).
The Committee reiterates, in this connection, its view that, given the magnitude
of resources the Organization spends on information and communication
technology, the creation of a new senior position of Chief Information Officer of
the United Nations who would be responsible for developing the information
and communication technology strategy, operational policies and procedures
and the most appropriate structure for the service, would appear to be
justified. The Committee stressed the importance of appointing to the post an
expert with extensive professional expertise in the day-to-day running of a
complex information technology system (see A/58/7, para. 126). Other
comments, observations and recommendations on information and communication
technology issues are reflected below in the Committee’s review of section 28D of
the proposed budget.

M. Hospitality

113. The total estimate for hospitality in the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2006-2007 is slightly more than $1 million (before recosting). While this
is a comparatively small amount, its misuse or a lack of transparency in its use can
convey an improper image both inside and outside the Secretariat. It is thus
important to ensure that it is used in strict accordance with guidelines. The provision
and use of hospitality funds is governed by administrative instruction ST/AI/2002/8.
However, the Advisory Committee has observed no clear rationale for the estimates
under this heading in the various sections of the proposed programme budget. Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that the estimates were based on past
experience. The Committee believes that there should be greater consistency in
the provision of funds for hospitality and trusts that the Secretary-General will
do his utmost to ensure transparency in future budgeting of such costs. In this
connection, the Committee requests the Board of Auditors to review the matter
at its earliest possible convenience.

N. Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs and Repertoire of
the Practice of the Security Council

114. The report of the Secretary-General on the Repertory of Practice of United
Nations Organs and the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council
(A/59/189) provides an update of the efforts undertaken to reduce the backlog in the
publication of the Repertory and the Repertoire, in accordance with General
Assembly resolution 58/248.

115. Concerning the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs, the Advisory
Committee was informed that during the past 12 months, studies pertaining to
volume I of Supplement Nos. 7, 8 and 9 and volumes IV and VI of Supplement Nos.
8 and 9 had been finalized. However, in 2004 the pace of preparation of the studies
had slowed down considerably owing to a lack of funds, which has affected the
progress of the work of practically all departments. The current pace of work raises
the risk of increasing the backlog of volumes for which it had been gradually
reduced in the past, such as volumes II and V of Supplement No. 8. It is likely that
in 2005 the backlog will start to accumulate in volumes IV and VI, where it had



37

A/60/7

been almost eliminated. This contrasts markedly with previous years, when steady
progress in the preparation of studies has resulted in a reduction in the backlog. The
Committee trusts that a way can be found to achieve as much progress on the
Repertory as on the Repertoire.

116. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 58/248, the General Assembly encourages
cooperation with academic institutions in reducing the backlog. The Secretary-
General reports that several externs assisted in the research for a study on Article 2,
paragraph 4, of the Charter for a period of a few months. That experience
demonstrated that, while this type of cooperation was certainly useful, it could be
considered only a complementary resource for researching and collecting data
during the preparatory phase of the studies. The bulk of the work of writing up the
studies requires experienced Secretariat staff.

117. With regard to the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council, the
Advisory Committee was informed that, as requested by the Member States, the
Secretariat was in the process of upgrading the United Nations website to introduce
multiple search capabilities. Advance versions of individual chapters are posted on
the website once they have been completed and approved, eliminating the lengthy
delays involved in their preparation for external publication. A significant increase
in the use of the published supplements to the Repertoire already posted on the
United Nations website has been noted.

118. According to the Secretary-General, the preparation and production of the
Repertoire would not have been possible without the continued support of the
General Assembly. Nonetheless, voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund for the
Updating of the Repertoire remain an important element in sustaining progress in a
situation where there are financial constraints.

119. The Secretary-General states that the consolidated reporting on the Repertory
of Practice of United Nations Organs and the Repertoire of the Practice of the
Security Council has contributed to a lack of clarity regarding the respective
mandates and scope of the two publications (A/59/189, para. 16). The Advisory
Committee does not agree with this assessment. Any confusion between the two
should be addressed through the proper dissemination of appropriate
information. Otherwise, the Committee recommends that the General Assembly
deal with the Repertory and the Repertoire, taking into account the suggestions
of the Secretary-General in paragraphs 10 and 17 of his report.

O. Publications

120. The Advisory Committee has commented extensively about publications over
the years. The Committee has noted considerable progress in this area, where steps
have been taken to use technological advances to streamline the publication process
and to disseminate a number of publications electronically. Moreover, greater
outreach is being attempted through the use of electronic media. The Committee
calls for continued attention in this important area and looks forward to a
renewed and more vigorous Publications Board, which has recently been
reconstituted by the Secretary-General.

Q. Format of the report of the Advisory Committee

122. The present report follows the format used in the Advisory Committee’s
review of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, in which the
Committee attempted to minimize the duplication of information already available
in the budget document and to focus on providing analyses; major emphasis was
placed on observations and recommendations aimed at improving the management
and utilization of resources that could facilitate decision-making in the General



40

A/60/7

Assembly. It should be noted that all references to budgetary resources in the
present report are at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting) unless
specifically identified as being at 2006-2007 rates.

R. Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions

123. It should be noted that estimates for the Advisory Committee itself for 2006-
2007 include an additional four weeks of meeting time in comparison with the
initial estimates for 2004-2005. This is necessitated, inter alia, by the expansion in
the number, scope and complexity of peacekeeping operations (see A/59/736, paras.
29 and 30) and represents a trend for the work programme of the Committee in
recent years. In this connection, the Committee points out that the number of reports
it has issued increased from 93 in the biennium 1994-1995 to 137 in the biennium
2002-2003 and is continuing to increase, despite a concerted effort to limit the
number by consolidating reports on related subjects. Without this effort, it is entirely
possible that the number of reports issued in recent years would be at least twice
what it was in 1994-1995. Given these developments, the Committee and its
secretariat are finding their time and human capacity stretched to the limit. The
Committee is now in almost continuous session throughout the year, meeting twice a
day, every day, compared with a more flexible daily schedule in the past. The time
available for members to study documents and prepare for meetings is thus limited
to nights and weekends. Obviously, such a situation was not foreseen when the
Committee was first established. The General Assembly may wish to discuss this
issue and provide appropriate guidance in this regard.

S. Overall position of the Advisory Committee on the initial budget
estimates for the biennium 2006-2007

124. During its consideration of the proposed programme budget, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the estimates pertaining to a number of sections
might be significantly affected by decisions yet to be taken on the Secretary-
General’s latest proposals for reform. Moreover, the Committee was informed
that the Secretary-General intended to submit revised estimates for the Office
of Internal Oversight Services and that the General Assembly would be
receiving an implementation report on measures approved for the newly
created Department of Safety and Security. In addition, and in accordance with
approved procedures, revised estimates will be submitted for the International
Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO. The Committee intends to deal with these
matters as they arise during the sixtieth session of the Assembly. In the
meantime, the Committee has adopted a step-by-step approach and has dealt
with the estimates placed before it on their own merits.

125. The Advisory Committee has consistently pointed to the need to go beyond
incremental budgeting and to evaluate and consider the entire quantum of
resources necessary to carry out the programmes and activities mandated by
the General Assembly and other organs. Nevertheless, after a thorough
consideration of the estimates, the Committee finds itself, by and large, in
agreement with the overall budget level proposed by the Secretary-General.
The Committee, in chapter II of the present report, has made a number of



41

A/60/7

specific recommendations regarding posts and other objects of expenditure, but
the reductions recommended do not significantly affect the overall level of the
budget. In this connection, the Committee has refrained from providing a total
costing for those recommendations since, if they are accepted by the General
Assembly, they will be taken into account in the recalculation traditionally
made by the Secretariat and furnished to the Fifth Committee before the
adoption of the budget by the Assembly. In its specific recommendations in
chapter II, the Advisory Committee has also pointed to a number of areas in
which economies can be achieved without making a specific recommendation
for a reduction. Such savings should be reported in the performance report.

126. In this period of restrained budgetary growth, it becomes increasingly
important to ensure that resources are used to effectively meet changing
priorities and requirements. The Advisory Committee has therefore
concentrated its efforts on making recommendations aimed at the most efficient
use of resources. As indicated above, there are a number of serious deficiencies
in the administration and management of the United Nations. With the
increasing emphasis on results and the demand of Member States for
accountability, it is absolutely essential to provide specific guidelines and
objectives for achieving greater productivity and efficiency. The Committee
trusts that its efforts will result in a positive contribution towards that end.

of the total number of posts by source of funds and grade level is
contained in annex I below.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

I.1 The establishment of one P-5 post is proposed for a Senior Conflict
Management Officer in the Office of the Ombudsman (A/60/6 (Sect. 1), para. 1.75).
The Advisory Committee notes that this post, which the Committee recommended
establishing for the biennium 2004-2005, is being resubmitted. The functions of the
post have been modified, however, to include the review, analysis and interpretation
of systemic trends that come to light through the cases dealt with by the Office, the
identification of problems and issues and the preparation of conclusions regarding
the scope of work of the Office. These functions are in addition to assisting the
Ombudsman and the Director of the Office on individual cases of conflict
resolution. It is anticipated that the Office will make recommendations directly to
the Secretary-General on the basis of such analysis. The Committee is concerned
that this may overstep the mandate of the Office. The Committee is of the opinion
that the Office of the Ombudsman should address high-priority operational
issues to the maximum extent possible. Analysis of issues beyond the mandate
of the Office should be left to entities such as the Office of Internal Oversight
Services and the Office of Human Resources Management. That being said, the
Committee recognizes the increased workload in conflict resolution cases
requiring senior-level involvement. The Committee therefore recommends
approval of the post for the purpose of assisting with the caseload of the Office.

I.2 The establishment of one P-3 post is proposed for an Information Advocacy
and Outreach Officer in the Office of the Ombudsman (ibid.). This post is requested



43

A/60/7

to assist in efforts to strengthen the communication and outreach strategy of the
Office and to provide information on the role of the Ombudsman and procedures for
conflict management. In this connection, the Advisory Committee was informed
that, of the Office’s constituency of approximately 27,600 staff members worldwide,
25 per cent is located at Headquarters, 32 per cent at offices away from
Headquarters and 43 per cent in the field missions. Furthermore, approximately
68 per cent of the staff members in the field are recruited locally. In view of the
distribution of the constituency of the Office of the Ombudsman, the
Committee believes that the outreach function is extremely important. It
therefore recommends approval of this post.

I.3 The establishment of two General Service (Other level) support staff is
requested for the Office of the Ombudsman (ibid.). The Advisory Committee was
informed that the workload of the Office had increased steadily since its
establishment — with 138 staff members seeking assistance in 2002, 405 in
2003, 420 in 2004 and 200 in 2005 as at 31 May. In view of the increasing
workload, the Committee recommends approval of the request for two General
Service support staff.

I.4 As noted in paragraph 1.69 of the proposed programme budget, by its
resolution 59/261 the General Assembly requested the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict to continue to submit reports to
the Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. Accordingly, resources from
the regular budget have been provided, as part of the revised appropriation for the
biennium 2004-2005, to maintain the Office of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General to December 2005. Funding beyond 2005 would be contingent
upon the availability of voluntary contributions and subject to the review of the
mandate of the Special Representative at the sixtieth session of the General
Assembly. Consequently, no provisions have been made for the biennium 2006-
2007. The eight posts in the Office would therefore be discontinued. The staffing of
the Office consists of one Under-Secretary-General, one P-5, three P-4/3, one
General Service (Principal level) and two General Service (Other level) posts.

Other comments and recommendations

Presentation

I.5 It appears that little account has been taken of the Advisory Committee’s
recommendation that an attempt should be made to refine the results-based-
budgeting presentation under executive direction and management (A/58/7, para.
I.16). The expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement (see A/60/6
(Sect. 1), table 1.20) read word-for-word as they did in the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 2004-2005. The results-based-budgeting presentation is
included for executive direction and management on the basis of a recommendation
made by the Committee for Programme and Coordination,10 which was endorsed by
the General Assembly in its resolution 56/253. The Committee points out, however,
that executive direction and management does not form part of the biennial
programme plan for the period 2006-2007; there would appear to be nothing,
therefore, preventing the Secretary-General from refining the objectives, expected
accomplishments and indicators of achievement. Accordingly, the Committee
reiterates its recommendation that an effort be made in the next proposed
programme budget to make the presentation for executive direction and



44

A/60/7

management more specific and to incorporate some of the advances in results-
based budgeting exhibited in other sections of the budget (see A/58/7, para.
I.16).

I.6 With regard to the presentation of the logical framework for the Office of the
Ombudsman, the Advisory Committee notes that the programme narrative in
paragraph 1.71 of the proposed programme budget contains hard data concerning
the number of cases brought to the Office as well as the percentage of those
resolved to the satisfaction of the staff member, which could have been used to
quantify performance measures. Upon enquiry concerning the indicator of
achievement which reads “reduction in the number of instances of recourse to the
formal grievance process”, the Committee was informed that there had been a
reduction of 30 per cent by 2003 in the number of cases submitted to the Joint
Appeals Board at Headquarters and a further reduction of 14 per cent by 2004. The
Committee recommends that quantifiable performance measures be included in
the next programme budget.

I.7 In a related matter, the Advisory Committee believes that consideration
should be given to including a results-based-budgeting presentation for the
secretariats of policymaking organs as well. The Committee understands the
difficulties entailed in formulating expected accomplishments and quantifiable
indicators of achievement for the secretariats of such entities; however, an
effort should be made to conform the presentation of this subsection with the
rest of the proposed programme budget.

General Assembly

I.8 Estimated resource requirements for backstopping of the Presidents of the
General Assembly by the Department for General Assembly and Conference
Management amount to $1,052,600 before recosting, an increase of $946,200 over
the appropriation for 2004-2005. The increase reflects the decision by the Assembly
to make available five additional posts to supplement the current support provided
to the Presidents of the Assembly, of which three are to be filled on an annual basis
following consultations with the incoming President (resolution 58/126). Two
positions have been identified (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) within the existing establishment of
the Department; the additional resources requested are to cover general temporary
assistance for the remaining three posts (1 D-2, 1 D-1 and one General Service).
The Advisory Committee believes that the provision of such support to the
Presidents of the Assembly is extremely important. The Committee notes,
however, that the Assembly, under the terms of resolution 58/126, had intended
that those costs be met from within existing resources. Therefore, while it does
not recommend a reduction in the amount proposed for 2006-2007, the
Committee urges that further efforts be made to identify existing resources that
could be used for that purpose for the biennium 2008-2009.

Board of Auditors

I.9 Regular budget resources requested for 2006-2007 for the Board of Auditors,
including its secretariat, amount to $5,587,400 before recosting (A/60/6 (Sect. 1),
table 1.13), reflecting an increase of $15,500 over the appropriation for 2004-2005.
In addition, a total of $11,951,400 in extrabudgetary resources is projected for the
biennium, an increase of approximately 19 per cent over the estimate for 2004-2005;



45

A/60/7

those resources relate to peacekeeping operations, United Nations funds and
programmes and other extrabudgetary programmes. In this connection, the
Advisory Committee recalls its observation that the percentage of external
audit costs charged to the regular budget appeared high in comparison with
that charged to peacekeeping operations (see A/58/7, para. I.23). The
Committee welcomes the more equitable distribution of costs as reflected in the
estimates for 2006-2007 (see table I.1 below).

I.10 The Advisory Committee was informed that the audit fee for 2006-2007 was
estimated at $16,279,300 and included an increase of $1,883,100 ($215,400 from
the regular budget and $1,667,700 in extrabudgetary resources). The Committee was
further informed that the increase was due to: (a) new activities, such as the audit of
the UNRWA Area Staff Provident Fund and peacekeeping missions in Burundi, Côte
d’Ivoire, Haiti, and Liberia; (b) unfavourable exchange rate movement for the
United States dollar; and (c) increased audit coverage. With the exception of the
continuation of the annual report on the capital master plan, which was requested
during the biennium 2002-2003, no additional requests have been made to the Board
thus far for special audits that would require separate or additional resources during
the biennium 2006-2007.

I.11 Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with information on the
growth in the total cost of external audits since the biennium 1998-1999 (see table
I.1).

(i) A reduction of $32,460 in the audit fee for the United Nations Institute for Training and

Mission in Kosovo.

I.12 Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with the actual audit
costs as against available resources for the four bienniums since 1998 (see table I.2).
The present practice for determining the amount of the audit fee is that the Board
presents the allocation of audit assignments to the Committee for concurrence. The
audit work is then divided among the three members of the Board and, at the end of
each year, the auditors submit a summary of their fees. They are reimbursed up to
the maximum amount approved by the General Assembly. The amount appropriated
by the Assembly is normally shared equally among the three members. However,
should there be a special audit undertaken by only one Board member, the Board
may decide to allocate those fees to that member. The Committee was informed that
only one of the three Board members reported costs higher than available resources.
The Committee intends to continue to monitor the adequacy of the audit fee.

I.13 The Advisory Committee requested information concerning the resources
spent on outside expertise relating to audit assignments. It was informed that for the
biennium 2002-2003, outsourcing costs amounted to $408,823, while the estimate
for 2004-2005 was $296,297.



47

A/60/7

I.14 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that it was estimated
that the number of on-site auditor-weeks in 2004-2005 would amount to 2,213. For
2006-2007, the proposal included 2,430 on-site auditor-weeks.

Committee for Programme and Coordination

I.15 As indicated in paragraph 1.32 of the proposed budget, by its resolution 31/93
of 14 December 1976, the General Assembly authorized the payment of travel
expenses and subsistence allowance to the members of the Committee for
Programme and Coordination as a special exception to the basic principles
contained in paragraph 2 of resolution 1798 (XVII). This arrangement was approved
for an experimental period beginning in 1978 and was to have been reviewed by the
Assembly at its thirty-fourth session. The Committee notes that the results of the
experiment have not yet been assessed. The estimates in the proposed programme
budget are based on the assumption that those arrangements are still in place and
that the Committee will meet for six weeks in the off-budget year and for four
weeks in the budget year, even though the mandate of the Committee has changed
considerably. The estimates thus represent a continuation of the current level of
resources.

Executive Office of the Secretary-General

I.16 Proposed regular budget resources for the Executive Office of the Secretary-
General amount to $23,209,000 before recosting, a decrease of $713,700, or 3 per
cent, in comparison with the appropriation for 2004-2005. The reduction is
attributable mainly to the non-recurrence of the one-time provision for activities
carried out by the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General to enhance international
peace and security in 2004 (see A/60/6 (Sect. 1), para. 1.41).

I.17 The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General has undertaken a
reorganization of the Executive Office, including strengthening the Office of the
Chef de Cabinet and establishing a Scheduling Office. The goal of the establishment
of the Scheduling Office is to allow the Secretary-General to make well-informed
decisions regarding the use of his time and to ensure that he receives the talking
points, briefing materials and operational support he needs to make the most of his
meetings and other activities. In order to implement the reorganization, the Office of
External Relations has been abolished. Most of its functions have been redistributed
among the Department of Management, the Department of Public Information, the
Department for General Assembly and Conference Management and the United
Nations Fund for International Partnerships. A number of functions have been
retained in the Executive Office, in the Scheduling Office and in the Office of the
Deputy Secretary-General, such as coordinating the participation of the Secretary-
General in events at and away from Headquarters and convening periodic meetings
of the interdepartmental working group of focal points on non-governmental
organization/civil society issues. The staffing complement of the Office of External
Relations consisted of one Assistant Secretary-General, one D-1, one P-4, one P-3
and two General Service (Other level) posts. The Assistant Secretary-General post
has been redeployed to the Office of the Chef de Cabinet, with the functional title of
Deputy Chef de Cabinet, and the remaining five posts have been redeployed to the
Scheduling Office (ibid., para. 1.39). The Committee has commented in chapter I
above on the growing tendency to establish deputy posts in the Secretariat.

I.18 In the course of discussions on the Offices of the Directors-General, the
Advisory Committee enquired as to measures to ensure accountability. It was
informed that each of the Directors-General was required to sign a compact with the
Secretary-General committing to the achievement of various programme and
management objectives, which included benchmarks in such human resources
planning areas as gender balance, geographical distribution and vacancy
management. The Committee has commented on the compacts in some detail in
chapter I and has expressed its view, inter alia, that an effective tool should be
developed to ensure accountability and responsibility with regard to the
commitments made in the compacts.

United Nations Liaison Office at Addis Ababa

I.19 The United Nations Liaison Office at Addis Ababa was established in 1998 to
strengthen cooperation with the Organization of African Unity (now the African
Union). Since the establishment of the Office, there have been many developments
in preventive diplomacy and peacemaking in Africa, including the establishment of
a number of special missions and offices of special representatives, advisers and
envoys of the Secretary-General,11 which, directly or indirectly, also communicate
with the African Union. The Advisory Committee once again expresses its
concern that these offices may begin to duplicate one another (see
A/56/7/Add.8, para. 11). While the Committee recognizes that there may be a
need for a focal point for cooperation and coordination with the African Union,
especially in view of the fact that there are a number of United Nations entities
dealing with the African Union, it recommends that consideration be given to
the feasibility of integrating such functions within the Economic Commission
for Africa and/or some other entity in the region as a separately defined
responsibility.

United Nations Office at Brussels

I.20 A grant in the amount of $519,500 is proposed for the United Nations Office at
Brussels to supplement the existing resources of the Office, which is currently
operated by UNDP. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the
posts currently funded by UNDP in the United Nations Office at Brussels were as
follows: one D-2, three P-5, one P-4, two P-2 and four General Service posts. The
Committee was provided with a breakdown of the grant in terms of estimated
equivalent post and non-post resources, as follows:

Posts $414,500
Travel $6,000
Rental of premises $60,000
Communications $24,000
Maintenance of office automation equipment $7,000
Supplies $2,000
Acquisition of office automation equipment      $6,000

Total $519,500

The Committee was informed that the post resources of $414,500 would fund 50 per
cent of the equivalent biennial cost of one P-5, one P-4 and one General Service
post.

A/60/7

I.21 The rationale for the proposed level of support to be provided by the United
Nations and the provision of that support in the form of a grant has not been
explained to the Advisory Committee. Moreover, the Committee was informed that
the status of the Office vis-à-vis the Government of Belgium was still unresolved.
The Committee understands that the Director of the United Nations Office at
Brussels is also the head of the United Nations country team, which includes the
regional United Nations information centre and participating United Nations
agencies. The Committee recommends that, instead of a grant, traditional
procedures for cost recovery be followed whereby the United Nations would
reimburse UNDP on the basis of actual expenditure incurred by it on behalf of
the United Nations. Any payment made should be reflected in the performance
report. A more transparent explanation of the purposes of the grant, the status
of the Office and the participation of other entities should be provided in the
next proposed programme budget.

Office of the Ombudsman

I.22 The Advisory Committee was informed that since the creation of the Office of
the Ombudsman in 2002, there has been a significant decline in the number of cases
submitted for formal resolution to the Joint Appeals Board at Headquarters. The
number of cases submitted to the Board had declined by 30 per cent by 2003 and by
a further 14 per cent by 2004.

I.23 The Advisory Committee notes, as indicated in paragraph 1.74 of the proposed
budget, that any additional requirements for the Office of the Ombudsman arising
from decisions contained in General Assembly resolution 59/283 on the
administration of justice at the United Nations would be presented in the context of
the revised estimates for 2006-2007. By that resolution, the Assembly decided, inter
alia, that the Secretary-General should establish a panel of experts to consider
redesigning the system of administration of justice. The findings and
recommendations of the panel are to be submitted by July 2006.

I.24 Upon enquiry as to additional activities foreseen pursuant to resolution 59/283,
the Advisory Committee was informed that an area of great concern to the Office
was the need to provide services on an equitable basis worldwide, and, to that end,
the establishment of regional outposts was under consideration. As noted in
paragraph 1.72 of the proposed programme budget, the percentage of cases
originating at Headquarters is on the decline. The Committee was informed that the
results of the pilot project undertaken at the United Nations Office at Vienna, which
was mentioned in paragraph I.26 of the Committee’s first report on the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005,4 had been very positive. In this
connection, the Committee recalls its statement that it trusted that the Office of the
Ombudsman at Headquarters would provide leadership for ombudsmen throughout
the United Nations and in the peacekeeping operations and that the Ombudsman
should be involved in setting up such offices, where appropriate, as well as in
setting standards and operating procedures (ibid., para. I.27). The Committee notes
the intention to broaden the scope of services provided to field offices and locally
recruited staff. The Committee expects that any such attempt will take full
account of lessons learned, capacity and means and methods employed in field-
based organizations.

United Nations Administrative Tribunal

I.25 The Advisory Committee notes that, in accordance with paragraph 36 of
General Assembly resolution 59/283, the resources of the United Nations
Administrative Tribunal are to be transferred from section 8, Legal affairs, to
section 1 starting with the biennium 2006-2007; the budget fascicles for sections 1
and 8, which were prepared prior to the adoption of resolution 59/283, will have to
be amended accordingly.

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

I.26 The establishment of one P-3 post for an Information Technology Programmer
in the Planning and Coordination Section, Division of Conference Services, Nairobi
is proposed (A/60/6 (Sect. 2), para. 2.83). A new P-3 post is requested to manage the
information and performance monitoring system, enhance the development of
meeting and documentation applications, implement the electronic processing of
documentation and lead the technical support effort for further automation
initiatives. This is a resubmission of a request made for the biennium 2004-2005, for
which the Advisory Committee had recommended approval. The Committee was
informed that the Division of Conference Services did not have a dedicated
information technology component and therefore relied on the Information
Technology Service at Nairobi, which did not have the capacity to fully support the
conference services. As a consequence, the Division had been obliged at times to
get help from other duty stations. The Committee continues to believe that this
post will be required, particularly in view of the continued emphasis of the
Department on the eventual full electronic processing of documentation; it
therefore recommends approval of this post.

I.27 The establishment of 11 Reviser/Translator posts (9 P-4 and 2 P-3) is proposed
in the Translation and Editorial Section, Nairobi (ibid., para. 2.87). These posts are
requested in lieu of posts currently funded on a reimbursable basis from the
extrabudgetary resources of UNEP, UN-Habitat and other United Nations agencies,
funds and programmes. The Advisory Committee points out that the request is in



51

A/60/7

accordance with General Assembly resolution 52/220, by which the Assembly
requested the Secretary-General to bring the financial arrangements of the United
Nations Office at Nairobi into line with those of similar United Nations
administrative offices and to provide UN-Habitat with the capacity to improve its
financial and administrative management. However, the time frame for
implementing this policy has not been specified. The Committee has no technical
reason for objecting to any of the transfers; it will be for the Assembly to decide
on whether all should be effected in 2006-2007.

I.28 A total of 25 posts under the regular budget, plus two through cost-sharing, are
proposed for abolition under section 2 due largely to the Organization’s return on
investment in technology and the implementation of organizational measures such
as streamlined administrative and workflow processes, consolidation of reports and
enforcement of page limits. The posts to be abolished are as follows: (a) in New
York: 16 General Service (Other level) posts (1 under executive direction and
management, 1 each under subprogrammes 1, 2 and 3 and 12 under subprogramme
4) and 2 Trades and Crafts posts (under subprogramme 4); (b) in Geneva: 7 General
Service (Other level) posts relating to distribution, reproduction and text-processing
activities; and (c) in Vienna: 2 General Service (Other level) posts relating, inter
alia, to a reduction of workload in text-processing and reproduction. Upon request,
the Advisory Committee was provided with a breakdown of proposed abolitions by
duty station and office (see table I.3). The Committee trusts that the abolition of
the posts in question will not be offset in future by requests for Professional
staff to perform essentially similar functions.

I.30 In addition, it is proposed to redeploy two General Service (Other level) posts
in New York to the Department of Public Information under Income section 3,
Services to the public, reflecting a transfer to that Department of responsibilities for
managing overall sales and dispatch activities relating to United Nations
publications (see A/60/6 (Sect. 2), para. 2.39). Upon enquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that there were currently six staff members in the Sales
Dispatch Unit. The proposal is to transfer all the functions of the Unit to the
Department of Public Information, together with two General Service (Other level)
posts and one General Service staff member already financed by the Department of
Public Information through general temporary assistance. The three remaining
General Service (Other level) posts in the Sales Dispatch Unit have been proposed
for abolition. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the incumbents of
those posts would be reassigned to existing vacancies within the Publishing Section,
where they would be performing similar distribution functions. The Department
acknowledges that this will partly negate the efficiency gains; however, this is
considered the best possible solution at this time in terms of staffing because the
Department is faced with the matter of placing the three staff members in positions
that match their skill profiles.

Recommendations on non-post requirements

I.31 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the overall decrease
of $8.7 million for other staff costs under section 2 consisted of reductions of
$8,313,700 in temporary assistance for meetings, $35,000 in general temporary
assistance and $354,300 in overtime. These reductions relate mainly to: (a) the
transfer of some resources to contractual translation in line with the current policy
of the Department to increase reliance on contractual translation services as a more
cost-effective way of having certain types of materials translated; and (b) to
anticipated savings owing to such organizational measures as consolidation of
reports and enforcement of page limits and streamlining and re-engineering of
workflow processes. The Committee notes that the reductions are offset in part by
an increase of $5,599,200 under contractual services. The Committee held a detailed
discussion with representatives of the Secretary-General concerning all of these
matters.

I.32 The Advisory Committee notes that the estimates for contractual services
under subprogramme 2, Planning, development and coordination of conference
services, in New York include a $1.4 million phased information technology project
(see para. I.42 below).

Other comments and recommendations

I.33 At the end of its session on the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007,
the Advisory Committee received an advance copy of a report of the Secretary-
General on reform of the Department for General Assembly and Conference
Management (A/60/112). The Committee questions the timing of the submission of
the report. Surely its contents should have been taken into account in the
consideration of section 2 of the proposed programme budget. The Committee will
have to take up the report at its next session. The Committee reiterates that
reports relating to matters covered in the proposed programme budget should
be submitted in time for the Committee to consider them in conjunction with
the proposed programme budget.

A/60/7

Presentation

I.34 The Advisory Committee commends the Department for General
Assembly and Conference Management for its continued improvement of the
presentation of the budget fascicle and its attention to recommendations of the
Committee. It notes in particular the level of detail provided in annex III to section
2 on the status of implementation and expected benefits of major information
technology projects; however, in some cases a clearer indication is needed
concerning the state of progress on particular information technology projects (see
para. I.45 below).

I.35 With regard to the logical framework, the Advisory Committee notes that the
awkward phrasing, using two negatives, of the indicator of achievement “decreased
percentage of representatives and Member States at intergovernmental organs and
members of expert bodies expressing dissatisfaction with the quality of conference
services”, which forms part of the framework for subprogramme 2, Planning,
development and coordination of conference services, for each of the duty stations,
renders the formulation of performance measures a little difficult. The Committee
understands that this is an approved text that figures in the biennial
programme plan; however, it would recommend a positive reformulation for
this and other such indicators of achievement for the next biennium.

I.36 The Advisory Committee was informed that the surveys used to measure the
percentage of client “dissatisfaction” received a response rate of only 12 to 15 per
cent. It may well be that users respond to such surveys only when they have
something to complain about, in which case the low response rate is good news;
however, if performance is truly to be measured, the Department will need to come
up with new tools or innovative ways to motivate response. The Committee was also
informed that the Department had been constrained in formulating the wording of
the surveys by the need to have responses that fit into the logical framework.

I.37 A further complication in the logical framework is the inclusion of indicators
that read more like external factors. For example, the indicator “decreased
percentage of documents not submitted by author departments/offices in accordance
with the required deadline” is something that the Department can encourage but
cannot control; it should therefore be the responsibility of the submitting
departments. In fact, it was reported to the Committee that the Department was
encountering difficulty in enforcing adherence to page limits and the deadlines that
emanate from the slotting system. The Department reported that it might be that the
only avenue open to it was “naming and shaming” of those submitting offices that
consistently submitted their reports late or exceeded the page limits. The Advisory
Committee believes, in fact, that this indicator of achievement should form part
of the logical framework for each of the submitting departments rather than
for the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management.

I.38 The Advisory Committee notes that there is something of a disconnect
between the budget narrative and the results-based-budgeting presentation. In
particular, the Committee points out that performance measures are expressed in
different units than are used in the workload indicators used in the supplementary
information provided to the Committee. The performance measure for translation,
for example, is expressed in pages, whereas workload indicators are given in
thousands of words. The Committee requests that these tables be harmonized.



55

A/60/7

I.39 With regard to the “optimal mix” of various modes of translation, which is
included as an indicator of achievement under subprogramme 3,
Documentation services, the Advisory Committee suggests that, in future,
performance measures be expressed in percentages rather than number of
pages.

Efficiency gains

I.40 Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with information
concerning efficiency gains reflected under section 2 of the proposed programme
budget. It is estimated that the gains represent a total of $13,138,000, broken down
roughly as follows: $3.9 million relating to the abolition of 27 posts (see para. I.28
above), $7.2 million relating to reduced workload and decreased requirements for
general temporary assistance, temporary assistance for meetings and overtime and
$2 million resulting from the expansion of the use of contractual translation.

Information technology

I.41 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that estimated resource
requirements under section 2 for information technology amounted to $23,580,400
(see table I.5). The information in table I.5 was provided, in part, in response to the
request of the Committee in paragraph I.68 of its first report on the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2004-20054 for clear identification of the
information technology function, including total cost, staffing and other
requirements. It does not, however, as the Committee also requested, give an
indication of the benefits relative to the costs of proposed projects. The Committee
reiterates its request that such information be provided in the next proposed
programme budget.

technology project to design and develop an application to integrate systems at
conference-servicing offices in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi with the aim

of implementing global management and integrating the management of meetings
and documentation. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with

I.43 The Advisory Committee welcomes this initiative and trusts that real
progress will be made during the biennium in, among other things, ensuring
interactive capability among the various document-tracking systems in use at
the four main duty stations and in developing an electronic means of
determining workload across duty stations, as previously recommended by the
Committee (A/58/7, para. I.63). Without these very basic tools, global
management will remain a mere concept.

I.44 As mentioned in paragraph I.34 above, the Advisory Committee welcomes the
inclusion of annex III on the status of implementation and expected benefits of
major information technology projects in section 2 of the proposed programme
budget. However, the shorthand used in the column headed “Progress —
milestones” makes a re-read necessary in some cases to determine which items have
been completed, which are in progress and which have not yet been started, and
even then it is difficult to be sure of the correct interpretation. In fact, time lines for
the completion of some projects are conspicuously missing from the annex. There is
no indication, for example, of whether work has even started on the electronic
documentation planning and monitoring system.

I.45 The Advisory Committee was informed during its hearings on section 2 that
progress in information technology in the Department had, in general, been slower
than projected. As one of the largest departments in the Secretariat, the Department
for General Assembly and Conference Management is under pressure to develop
systems to streamline work processes and increase efficiency, and every biennium
ambitious plans are made; however, as the Committee has commented in the past
(see ibid., paras. I.69 and I.70), many of the projects reappear biennium after
biennium with no clear picture given of progress achieved, leaving the impression
that the obstacles to implementation are insurmountable. The Committee believes
the Department needs to have realistic goals for its information technology



58

A/60/7

projects. It must also commit to a time frame for achieving each of those
projects, and, if unforeseen obstacles to implementation are encountered, an
explanation should be provided and an alternative plan of action proposed.
Furthermore, if it turns out that a project does not yield the desired results, the
Department should drop it so as to minimize the waste of resources.

I.46 The Advisory Committee notes, in this connection, that translation is an area
in which information technology investments have not provided the expected results
or savings. Most of the financial return on investment has been realized in the areas
of meetings planning, publishing and text-processing. The Committee recognizes
that achievement of savings is not the only end; measures to improve quality
and accuracy are important as well, particularly in an environment in which
consideration is being given to outsourcing more and more of the work of the
Department (see paras. I.59-I.62 below); however, the Committee reiterates its
request that the benefits relative to the costs of proposed projects be indicated
in the proposed programme budget (see para. I.41 above).

I.47 Nevertheless, the Advisory Committee notes that great strides have been made
in some areas of technological innovation. Electronic meeting scheduling and
resource allocation through e-Meets and the interpreter assignment programme, for
example, both appear to be quite successful. The Committee also notes that the e-
Folder system, through which reference material is provided electronically to
translation staff and contractual translators, has been used to some degree since
2002. The Committee understands there has been some resistance to its use, with
some translators printing out their own hard copies of reference materials, but this
will, in all likelihood, change with time. It may be that the reference function will
then need to be refashioned to involve a core of staff doing more in-depth
research and/or database development. Other areas, such as computer-assisted
translation and work on making the document-tracking systems compatible among
the duty stations, seem to go on with little progress reported from biennium to
biennium.

Workload and staffing requirements

I.48 Estimated regular budget requirements for posts and other staff costs for 2006-
2007 amount to $476,278,400 before recosting, a decrease of $11,005,100, or
2.3 per cent, as compared with the appropriation of $487,283,500 for 2004-2005.
The estimates include a decrease of $8,703,000 under staff costs, owing in large
measure to reduced requirements for temporary assistance for meetings as the result
of streamlined workflow processes, the implementation of measures aimed at
consolidating reports and enforcing page limits and increased reliance on
contractual and off-site translation.

I.49 The Advisory Committee recalls once again General Assembly resolution
57/283 B, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to develop
methods and indicators for assessing the performance of conference services from a
full-system standpoint, recognized the need to develop or update existing workload
standards and invited the Secretary-General to further develop the performance
indicators in order to evaluate the functions performed by the language services. In
order to allow sufficient time for the Secretariat to prepare a report on these matters,
the Committee had recommended that it be submitted to the Assembly at its fifty-
ninth session, in time for the results to be used in formulating the proposed



59

A/60/7

programme budget for 2006-2007 (see A/58/7, para. I.59). The Committee notes
from table 2.46 of the budget that the decision has been made to postpone
completion of the report once again, with the reasoning that “at a time when so
much in the Department is in flux, with work processes and organizational
relationships being re-engineered, it would be untimely to revise the existing
workload standards in the context of the preparations for the programme budget for
the biennium 2006-2007”. It is further stated that a revision of the workload
standards, should it be warranted, would not have a significant impact on the level
of permanent staffing, which “traditionally has been deliberately set below the
projected workload”.

I.50 The Advisory Committee finds this response disappointing, especially
given the further request by the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session that
the Secretary-General pursue the study of workload standards and
performance measurement, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, with a
view to submitting to the Assembly a proposal for a comprehensive
methodology for performance measurement and management from a full-
system perspective (resolution 59/265, sect. II.B, para. 10). It seems to the
Committee, for example, that the “optimal mix” of various modes of
translation, which is listed as an indicator of achievement under subprogramme
3, Documentation services, will be difficult to determine in the absence of
updated workload standards. Accordingly, the Committee believes that the
tasks requested by the Assembly should be undertaken forthwith and reported
to the Assembly as soon as possible.

I.51 With regard to workload-sharing among duty stations, the Advisory
Committee was informed that this was done almost exclusively for interpretation, as
the workload in translation and editing in each of the duty stations was such that it
did not permit the release of staff to fill in gaps at other duty stations. Upon request
the Committee was provided with details of workload-sharing in the area of
interpretation (see table I.7). The Committee welcomes these efforts and
encourages the Secretariat to continue to explore the possibilities for sharing
workload among the duty stations in areas other than interpretation.

I.52 The Advisory Committee notes from table 2.9 of the proposed programme
budget that the estimated recruitment and placement time for 2004-2005 is 200 days
and the target for 2006-2007 is 150 days. Those figures represent a significantly
shorter recruitment and placement period than that indicated for other parts of the
Secretariat. Upon enquiry as to the reasons, the Committee was informed that once a
candidate had passed the competitive examinations for translators, interpreters or
editors, he or she is placed on a roster and can be recruited very quickly. The
Committee notes, however, that the time-consuming tasks of writing the
examinations, grading papers and conducting oral examinations do not figure into
the recruitment time line.

I.53 The Advisory Committee notes with concern from the additional information
provided to it that the projected number of retirements in the Department for
General Assembly and Conference Management in 2006-2007 are the highest in the
Secretariat, at 175 (68 in the Professional category and above and 107 General
Service staff). The Committee welcomes the emphasis placed by the Department
on succession planning, as described in table 2.46 of the proposed programme
budget. It has been pointed out to the Committee that vacancies relating to
retirements can be posted well ahead of time. In specialized areas, such as
translation, interpretation and editing, however, posts often become vacant because
the incumbent has been promoted, and the lower-level post can be advertised only
once the incumbent has been selected for the new post. Since this phenomenon is
fairly predictable, the Committee recommends that, in such exceptional cases,
the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management work out a



61

A/60/7

procedure with the Office of Human Resources Management whereby posts
that are likely to become vacant are advertised ahead of time, with the proviso
that they will be filled if and when they become vacant.

I.54 The Advisory Committee notes from the report of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services on the availability in local labour markets of the skills for which
international recruitment for the General Service category takes place (A/59/388)
that the average additional common staff costs associated with internationally
recruited General Service staff are estimated at $1,268.50 per staff member per
month. In the same report, the Office noted that some 89 General Service staff
members in the text-processing units, who are currently entitled to international
benefits, were due to retire by 2015; if those staff members were replaced by locally
recruited staff, the accumulated savings would amount to approximately
$8.1 million at 2004-2005 rates over the next 10 years. Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that the Department was actively endeavouring to identify
local personnel with the requisite skills for the text-processing services and that
progress in that regard would be reported to the General Assembly at its sixtieth
session.

Costing of conference services

I.55 The Advisory Committee enquired as to progress achieved in the development
of a cost-accounting system for conference services. It was informed that the
Department for General Assembly and Conference Management did not intend to
pursue any cost-accounting mechanisms on its own in view of the fact that a
feasibility study was to be undertaken by the Office of Programme Planning, Budget
and Accounts on the scope of requirements for developing improved tools for
identifying the cost of activities and outputs (see also chap. I, para. 23, above;
General Assembly resolution 59/275 and decision 59/549; and A/C.5/59/13). The
Department does have, however, a conference costing programme in place for
meetings and documentation services, which is currently used to calculate the cost
of additions to the calendar of conferences. The programme has some drawbacks in
that it does not capture all the cost elements involved.

Comments on subprogrammes

I.56 The Advisory Committee welcomes the standardization of subprogrammes
across duty stations, as it had recommended previously (see A/58/7, para. I.75).
The Committee reiterates its assertion, however, that publishing should be
combined with other services dealing with the processing and production of
documents rather than with interpretation (ibid., para. I.76). The Committee
understands, as indicated in table 2.46 of the proposed programme budget, that the
current presentation is consistent with subprogramme 4 of programme 1 of the
biennial programme plan for the period 2006-2007. It therefore recommends that
consideration be given to reorganization of the subprogrammes in the context
of the biennial programme plan for 2008-2009.

Planning, development and coordination of conference services

I.57 The Advisory Committee notes that the post requirements under this
subprogramme in New York reflect an internal reorganization of the meeting
coordination functions with a view to strengthening the planning, programming,



62

A/60/7

monitoring and servicing capacity of the Central Planning and Coordination Service.
The reorganization will result in a net increase of 25 posts in the Service, as follows:
(a) the redeployment of 26 posts (1 P-3, 4 General Service (Principal level) and
21 General Service (Other level)) to the Service from the Meetings and Publishing
Division (subprogramme 4); and (b) the abolition of one General Service (Other
level) post.

I.58 This subprogramme is also being strengthened in Vienna through the
redeployment of seven posts from the translation and publishing sections as follows:
(a) one P-3 and four General Service (Other level) posts to consolidate the
information technology activities of the Conference Management Service under the
Office of the Chief; and (b) two General Service (Other level) posts to consolidate
and strengthen the documents control functions under the Planning, Coordination
and Meetings Section.

Documentation services

I.59 The Advisory Committee was informed that two pilot projects had been
undertaken relating to possibilities for greater reliance on off-site and contractual
translation and editing: one of them, begun in February 2005, involved off-site work
in the translation and editorial services in order to avoid travel and per diem costs.
Eight revisers and editors participated in the pilot project. The Department for
General Assembly and Conference Management reported that the “cost avoidance”
of contracting non-local freelancers to work off-site rather than on-site was
approximately 40 per cent. The other pilot project was to translate and issue all the
summary records from the main part of the fifty-ninth session of the General
Assembly in all six languages by 31 March 2005, using contractual translators for
two thirds of the workload. The outcome was successful. Upon request, the
Committee was provided with a breakdown of average global costs per page for
different modes of translation at all duty stations (see table I.8).

Table I.8

a Costs do not include processes essential to translation, such as editing and referencing or
shipping charges and administrative overhead.

I.60 The Advisory Committee welcomes the apparent success of these cost-
saving measures and encourages the Secretariat to continue to explore the
feasibility of using them more widely; however, a number of concerns occur to
the Committee in relation to the increased emphasis on contractual translation
and editing. The first is the necessity to have sufficient established capacity to
handle urgent or sensitive parliamentary documentation and ensure quality
control. With regard to the latter, it has been reported to the Committee that



63

A/60/7

documentation handled by contractual translators and editors must be checked
to some degree by United Nations translators and editors, thus diverting some
staff resources from actual translating and editing to revision tasks.
Furthermore, the Committee was informed that off-site translation resulted in
increased workload for the programming officers and front offices of the
services in question, which would need some strengthening were the off-site
model to be expanded. The related costs have not been factored into the budget
for contractual and off-site translation and editing. The Committee believes
these factors must be costed and figured into the calculation of cost avoidance.

I.61 Second, the Committee cautions that it must be kept in mind that the
United Nations requires the most competent of translators and that it therefore
needs to stay competitive in the market for translators. The Committee intends
to revert to this matter in the context of its consideration of the report of the
Secretary-General on reform of the Department for General Assembly and
Conference Management (A/60/112; see para. I.33 above).

I.62 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that a total of
$12,821,700 had been allocated to contractual translation in the estimates for 2006-
2007, including an additional provision $3,393,100. The Committee was also
informed that the increased emphasis on contractual translation would not have an
impact on established staffing, which, as noted in table 2.46 of the budget,
traditionally has been set below the projected workload; rather, it would reduce
requirements for temporary assistance for meetings and general temporary
assistance (see also para. I.31 above). With regard to off-site translation, as it is still
in the pilot project phase, no specific amount has been earmarked. Off-site
translators would be recruited on short-term contracts funded under temporary
assistance for meetings.

I.63 The Advisory Committee notes that a number of departments are including
requirements, under contractual services or consultants, for external translation of
materials that should ordinarily be handled by the Department for General Assembly
and Conference Management. This is ostensibly due to the fact that the Department
is so overburdened with parliamentary documentation that some publications and
other materials receive low-priority treatment. Departments have therefore hired
their own external translators.

I.64 In the view of the Advisory Committee, all formal translation of
publications and documents emanating from the United Nations Secretariat
into official languages of the Organization should be handled centrally by the
Department for General Assembly and Conference Management. If it is
perceived that translation is not possible internally within a reasonable time
frame, then there should be recourse to contractual translation through the
Contractual Translation Unit of the Department. The advantages of central
management of contractual translation include economies of scale relating to
the administrative overhead costs, a favourable bargaining position in contract
negotiations with external translators and, perhaps most importantly,
assurance of quality control.

I.65 This may mean that the Contractual Translation Unit will need to be
strengthened. The Committee recommends that consideration be given to
redeploying staff resources to the Unit from other areas. Thought will also have
to be given to how to handle the costs of external translation between the



64

A/60/7

requesting department and the Department for General Assembly and
Conference Management.

I.66 The Advisory Committee enquired as to why the editing function was being
strengthened in Geneva through redeployment even though the workload indicators
provided to it showed an anticipated reduction. The Committee was informed that
the reason was to address the editing backlog. It was also informed that the planned
strengthening of the reference function through redeployment was necessary as a
direct result of the recruitment freeze for General Service staff (for a detailed
discussion of this matter, see chap. I above).

Meetings and publishing services

I.67 The Advisory Committee was informed that the United Nations common
system agreement with the International Association of Conference Interpreters,
which governs the conditions of employment, remuneration, working conditions,
staffing strengths and workload of freelance interpreters, had expired on 30 April
2005. At the time of the Committee’s hearings, negotiations on a new agreement
were under way and were expected to be completed shortly. Among other things, the
new agreement would address the establishment of the European rate of
compensation, in addition to the current Headquarters and world rates. Under the
previous agreement, freelance interpreters with a professional domicile in Europe
were paid on the basis of the established Headquarters or world rates, but had the
option of being paid in either euros or United States dollars. Under the new
agreement, the European rate would be paid in euros and would more closely
address the conditions of service in the European region.

I.68 The Advisory Committee notes that one of the outputs of subprogramme 4 in
Geneva is the introduction of more formal quality-control procedures for freelance
interpreters, regular review and update of the freelance roster and closer cooperation
with universities to increase the number of new qualified interpreters (see A/60/6
(Sect. 2), para. 2.53 (a)). The Committee believes that there should be a
systematic Department-wide effort in this regard.

I.69 The Advisory Committee welcomes the effort made by the Department to
use interpreters flexibly. It was informed, for example, that the United Nations
Office at Vienna had only one team of interpreters; when additional capacity was
needed, interpreters were recruited locally. It was reported to the Committee that
this had never posed a problem, as a pool of interpreters was available in Vienna. In
addition, the Committee notes that the United Nations Office at Nairobi has, on the
recommendation of the Committee, expanded its cooperation in this regard with
other United Nations entities in the region, such as the Economic Commission for
Africa and the United Nations Office in Burundi (see table I.7 above). The
Committee was also informed that the job descriptions of interpreters in Nairobi
included a stipulation that they would be required to do translation or database
development when necessary. The Committee trusts that these innovations will
be extended to other duty stations as far as is practicable.

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $429,369,700*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $427,627,200

Projected extrabudgetary resources $11,946,100

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

II.1 The establishment of two posts (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) is requested for the
Electoral Assistance Division under subprogramme 2 (A/60/6 (Sect. 3), para. 3.34).
The Advisory Committee was informed that the request for those posts sought not
only to address a heavier workload, but also the need for electoral officers with
varied regional experience and skills, as well as the demand for greater coordination
of the work of the Division with other entities of the United Nations system.
However, of the 10 authorized Professional posts, 4 posts (40 per cent) were vacant
at the time (1 D-1 and 3 P-4) making it difficult if not impossible to assess the staff
needed to address the workload. The Committee recognizes the importance of the
work performed by the Electoral Assistance Division, the high demand for its
services, the time-sensitive nature of those services and its need for adequate
resources to carry out its functions. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed
that, as of June 2005, a management review of the Electoral Services Division
was being carried out by the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The
Committee is of the opinion that the review should be finalized as soon as
possible in order to determine the managerial and resource improvements or
changes required. Pending the results of that review, the Committee
recommends that no action be taken on these requests — information on the
results of the review should be provided to the Fifth Committee at the main
part of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. In the meantime, the
Committee expects that vacant posts will be filled expeditiously.

II.2 A total of six posts (1 P-3, 1 P-2, and 4 General Service (Other level)) were
abolished in December 2004 under subprogramme 3, Security Council affairs,
resulting from the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive
Directorate (see ibid., para. 3.38, and para. II.11 below).



66

A/60/7

Recommendations on non-post resources

II.3 An amount of $127,700 is proposed under executive direction and
management to provide for consultancy services for studies, research and analysis
concerning early warning and conflict prevention. The increase of $19,000
compared with 2004-2005 relates to the services of an expert to evaluate the
functioning of the secretariat of the Executive Committee on Peace and Security.
The Committee recalls that the Executive Committee was established in 1997 as part
of the Secretary-General’s reform initiatives approved in General Assembly
resolution 56/241; its key functions are indicated in paragraph 3.24 of the budget.
However, the Advisory Committee was informed that, given the challenges specific
to servicing a high-level committee and the problems encountered, it was considered
that a review would be advisable taking into account lessons learned and best
practices regarding structuring and supporting senior decision-making, particularly
in view of the establishment by the Secretary-General of the Policy Committee.
Such a review would also help to determine how the Executive Committee on Peace
and Security secretariat might evolve, since many of its functions will not be
assumed by the Policy Committee, as well as the best interaction between the two
secretariats. The Advisory Committee questions the feasibility of analysing the
functioning of just one executive committee; it may in fact be more productive
to look again at the whole executive committee structure. In any case, the
Committee is of the opinion that the expertise required to carry out this type of
review should be available in-house and therefore recommends against
provision of outside consultancy services for this purpose.

Other comments and recommendations

Cooperation and coordination with other entities of the United Nations

II.4 The Advisory Committee has previously referred to the need to enhance
timely coordination with other offices and entities of the United Nations, such as the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, UNDP or the Centre for Crime Prevention
and for a clear delineation of responsibilities between the Department of Political
Affairs and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

II.5 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with information
regarding the current number of special political missions and which department
administers them (see table below).

Assembly authorized the Secretary-General, as an exceptional measure, to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed
$13 million to supplement the financial resources of the Court.

II.6 The Advisory Committee has noted and encouraged the changes that have
occurred in the structure of the relationship between the Department of Political
Affairs and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the context of the
Secretary-General’s reform proposals, which recognizes the comparative strengths
of both departments (A/58/7, para. II.9). According to the Secretariat, the two
departments also closely cooperate and interact at the desk officer level regularly
and in the context of interdepartmental task forces.

II.7 The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that more needs to be done to
ensure an effective working relationship between the Department of Political
Affairs and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and that a description
of how the two departments coordinate should be included in the budget
document. The Committee has indicated the urgent need to revisit the issue of
coordination and cooperation between the two departments to ensure
complementarity and avoid potential duplication and overlap and to consider a
possible redistribution of resources to bring them in line with changes in
activities and priorities, particular attention being paid to the area of political
and strategic analysis (see A/59/784, para. 36, and A/58/7, para. II.9).

Electoral assistance

II.8 The Advisory Committee welcomes the information provided in tabular form
in annex I to section 3 of the budget regarding the workload related to electoral
assistance, as requested by the Committee (A/58/7, para. II.11). The Committee was
further informed that as at 31 May 2005, 29 new requests had been received during
the biennium 2004-2005, in addition to the 27 carried over from the previous
biennium, of which 6 were outside of the acceptance parameters (4-6 months ahead
of the planned electoral process); 11 requests had been completed as at that date. In



69

A/60/7

addition, the provision of electoral assistance as a component of peacekeeping
operations and peacebuilding missions has increased, and the Electoral Assistance
Division has recently worked or is currently working with such United Nations
missions as those in Afghanistan, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Haiti, Iraq, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and with peacebuilding offices
in Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic, Tajikistan and Palestine.

II.9 Additional resources amounting to $158,200 are proposed under contractual
services for the conversion of paper-based data into a web-based application in
order to allow electronic updating and maintenance and for the translation of
documents for Member States of election-related technical material; this represents
an entirely new provision. Resource requirements of $127,800, unchanged from
2004-2005 and corresponding to seven work-months, are proposed under
consultants and experts to provide for specialized technical expertise, not available
in-house, for the drafting and editing of technical papers, project formulation and
the preparation of electoral legislation analysis and reform papers.

Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process

II.10 The resources proposed for the Office of the United Nations Special
Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process amount to $13,137,900 (before
recosting), an increase of $373,900, or 2.9 per cent over the resources appropriated
for 2004-2005. The net increase is due mostly to the delayed impact of the eight
new posts approved for 2004-2005, offset in large part by a decrease under furniture
and equipment ($222,800) owing to the removal of non-recurrent costs provided for
the acquisition of vehicles during 2004-2005.

Security Council affairs

II.11 Following the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive
Directorate, the resources proposed for 2006-2007 under subprogramme 3, Security
Council affairs, reflect a consequential decrease of $3,515,000 relating to the
abolition of six posts ($961,200) and related non-post items ($2,553,800). As can be
seen from the table above, the estimate for the Counter-Terrorism Committee
Executive Directorate for 2004-2005 is $6.1 million. The Committee recalls that of
the eight posts allocated to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, six were abolished
(1 P-4, 1 P-2 and 4 General Service), while two posts (1 P-5 and 1 General Service)
were retained in the Security Council Affairs Division to provide technical services
to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, a subsidiary organ of the Council (see
A/59/534/Add.1, para. 151).

Special political missions

II.12 The total provision under special political missions for 2004-2005, as at
1 July 2005, amounted to $475,697,800 (see table above). The Advisory Committee
points out that any additional requirements will continue to be treated in accordance
with the relevant provisions of annex I, paragraph 11, of General Assembly
resolution 41/213. Moreover, the Committee will make relevant comments and
recommendations in the context of the report to be submitted by the Secretary-
General during the main part of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly on the
estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political
initiatives authorized by the Assembly and/or the Security Council. In chapter I



70

A/60/7

above, the Committee has made a number of comments with regard to the
methodology for analysing the provision for special political missions.

Section 4
Disarmament

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $19,868,400*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $18,739,900

Projected extrabudgetary resources $7,309,500

A summary of the Secretary-General’s proposals for regular budget posts
by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

II.13 The establishment of one P-5 post for the Conventional Arms Branch is
proposed under subprogramme 3 (A/60/6 (Sect. 4), para. 4.35). The incumbent will
be responsible for the operational aspects of practical disarmament and for issues
related to conventional weapons, activities related to fact-finding missions carried
out at the request of Member States to assess the proliferation of small arms and
light weapons, activities related to programmes for the collection and destruction of
weapons, the provision of technical assistance to Member States in response to
growing demand for such assistance, and guiding and supervising the practical
implementation of all activities related to conventional arms. The Advisory
Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.

II.14 One General Service post is proposed for abolition under subprogramme 1 in
the Conference on Disarmament secretariat and Conference Support Branch in
Geneva (ibid., para. 4.26). The Advisory Committee was informed that the reason
for the proposed abolition was a reduction in workload related to maintaining and
updating reference materials owing to improvements in information technology.

II.15 The Advisory Committee requested information regarding the vacancy
situation for the Department for Disarmament Affairs. As at 31 March, of the 55
authorized posts 5 were vacant. Three of the vacancies resulted from temporary
assignments (1 D-1, 1 P-2) or leave without pay (1 P-5) and have since been filled;
the other two posts (P-5) were advertised; one selected candidate declined and
another rostered candidate will take up the post shortly, and the selection process is
ongoing for the second post. The Committee was informed, however, that the main
hindrance to a more expeditious filling of vacancies was the Galaxy system, which
made the process of filling a vacancy extremely cumbersome and protracted,
averaging six to nine months. The Committee has made comments in this regard
in chapter I above.



71

A/60/7

Recommendations on non-post resources

II.16 Non-post resources under subprogramme 5, Regional disarmament, decrease
by $85,800 from $683,000 in 2004-2005 to $597,200 for 2006-2007 in view of the
discontinuation of one-time requirements approved in 2004 for strengthening
security arrangements at the regional disarmament centres. The Advisory
Committee notes, however, from information provided to it, that the request
includes an amount of $26,900 for consultants and experts to follow up on the
Department’s gender action plan. The Committee is of the opinion that such
expertise should be available in-house; accordingly, it recommends a reduction of
$26,900 (before recosting).

Other comments and recommendations

II.17 In paragraph II.21 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for
the period 2004-2005,4 the Advisory Committee requested that an assessment of the
situation of the regional centre for Asia and the Pacific be carried out for submission
to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session with a view to resolving the issue
of the relocation of the regional centre, which had been operating out of New York
instead of Kathmandu since 1987. The Committee was informed that the assessment
had not yet been finalized and that other elements were being taken into
consideration, such as the security issue related to separate United Nations offices in
different regions. The Committee reiterates the importance of resolving the issue
of the regional centre in an expeditious manner.

II.18 The Advisory Committee had an exchange with the Secretariat regarding
cooperation between the Department for Disarmament Affairs and the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations in which the Committee was informed that the
Department for Disarmament Affairs cooperated closely with the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations during the planning and implementation phase of
peacekeeping missions, in particular where there is a disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration component, by providing recommendations for the formulation of
plans or technical advice.

II.19 The Advisory Committee notes that a total of 118 outputs will be
discontinued, as identified in the annex to Section 4 of the budget. The Committee
welcomes the information provided with regard to publications and notes that
non-recurrent and recurrent publications are to be reduced from 101 in 2004-2005 to
73 in 2006-2007. The Committee was informed that all publications are published
internally, the only provision thus being an amount of $5,600 for contractual
services included under programme support for contingencies. The regional
publications are funded through extrabudgetary resources.

Section 5
Peacekeeping operations

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $97,300,200*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $92,859,800

Projected extrabudgetary resources $419,749,200

A summary of the Secretary-General’s proposals for regular budget posts
by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

II.20 No new regular budget posts are proposed for 2006-2007; the total of 381
will be maintained. The full staffing complement of the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations proposed for 2006-2007 is as follows:

Regular budget 381

Support account 568

Voluntary trust fund for assistance in mine action 21

Special account in support of extrabudgetary activities 2

Total 972

Recommendations on non-post resources

II.21 The Advisory Committee notes that several items under non-post resources
are clearly linked to regular budget posts and that those expenditures are charged in
a transparent manner, such as overtime, general temporary assistance and furniture
and equipment. However, the distinction between regular budget resources and
support account resources is somewhat more blurred as regards other non-post items
such as travel. In view of the uniqueness and special character of the financial
activities of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department exercises
its own judgement in charging these expenses. The Committee was informed that
travel to peacekeeping missions was charged to the specific mission and that, for
travel related to seminars and conferences, the rule was to get the requesting party
to pay. The Committee encourages the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
to strengthen its financial controls and to develop guidelines to differentiate the
treatment of regular budget and support account resources in this regard.

United Nations Truce Supervision Organization

II.22 Resources proposed for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization
(UNTSO) amount to $58,797,500 (before recosting), a net decrease of $17,100. The



73

A/60/7

Advisory Committee notes that support and assistance are provided to the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in the implementation of their mandates (A/60/6 (Sect.
5), paras. 5.47 and 5.51). The Committee continues to encourage increased
collaboration among UNIFIL, UNDOF and UNTSO in a way that optimizes the
use of support resources provided to the three missions, in particular those
related to equipment and supplies.

II.23 The $1,345,200 increase under posts for UNTSO includes the delayed impact
of the 17 security-related posts approved during 2004-2005. A medical unit is
proposed to be established through the redeployment of two Field Service posts
from the Information Technology Unit to provide immediate medical services for
mission personnel and their dependants within the mission area — this results in a
reduction of $21,100 under grants and contributions for joint medical services that
are no longer needed. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of this
proposal and trusts that those redeployments will not compromise information
technology capacity and thereby lead to future additional requests for posts
related to information technology. The Committee also encourages the gradual
replacement of international staff with national staff in peacekeeping
operations, wherever feasible and cost-effective, as indicated in its general
report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736, para. 58).

II.24 The decrease of $1,362,300 under non-post resources reflects mostly the
removal of one-time costs for security-related projects approved by the General
Assembly in its resolution 58/295. The Advisory Committee questioned the
resources for other staff costs, particularly as regards overtime ($117,800), which
includes an increase of $51,200. In this connection, the Committee was informed
that the charges, covering overtime for local bus drivers and night differential for
local security guards, were based on expenditure patterns.

II.25 The Advisory Committee questioned an increase of $19,000 in the provision
for communications ($650,100) under general operating expenses resulting from the
increased number of phones in operation and mobile and fixed INMARSAT satellite
units. The Committee was informed that, while recognizing the higher costs
associated with INMARSAT, the equipment was required for backup purposes when
other means of communication failed. Given its high cost, INMARSAT equipment
should be used as sparingly as possible. The provision for miscellaneous services
($445,900) also includes an increase of $23,800, which reflects the UNTSO share of
the cost of security services in Damascus and medical examination costs for exiting
military observers that were not previously budgeted.

United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan

II.26 Requirements for the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and
Pakistan (UNMOGIP) of $14,794,100 (before recosting) reflect a net decrease of
$1,967,600 compared to 2004-2005. The increase of $241,600 under posts relates to
the delayed impact of the four security posts approved for 2004-2005. The net
decrease under non-post resources is due mostly to reduced requirements under
general operating expenses and furniture and equipment, reflecting reductions under
communications, maintenance of transport equipment and freight and related
charges, as well as removal of the one-time costs for armoured vehicles approved as
part of the security arrangements in General Assembly resolution 58/295. It is



74

A/60/7

slightly offset by an increase of $189,400 in the provision for supplies and materials
($1,073,400) relating to the higher cost of petrol, oil and lubricants and the
introduction of the armoured vehicles, which consume more fuel than regular
vehicles.

Other comments and recommendations

II.27 The Advisory Committee notes that the regular budget resources proposed
under section 5 for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ($16,601,300 after
recosting), account for no more than 3 per cent of the total resources shown for this
section ($517,049,400). The Committee also notes that subprogrammes 4 and 5,
relating to civilian police and mine action coordination respectively, are both fully
funded from extrabudgetary resources, including the support account. The
Committee examined the resources proposed under the support account for the
period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 and made its comments and observations
in that regard in its related report (A/59/784). The Committee also made extensive
comments in connection with the subprogrammes/organizational units covered
under section 5 in the context of the estimates for the support account on such issues
as results-based-budgeting techniques and related elements, training, information
technology and so on (see ibid. and A/59/736).

II.28 The Advisory Committee is of the opinion, however, that efforts should
be made to improve the presentation of the budget proposals for UNTSO and
UNMOGIP, where the outputs presented are too general. Meaningful and
concrete information should be provided in order to better disclose the results.
An effort should also be made to improve the connection between the
performance measures and the indicators of achievement within the logical
framework for the rest of the proposed budget for section 5.

Section 6
Peaceful uses of outer space

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $6,313,500*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $5,903,900

Projected extrabudgetary resources $704,600

A summary of the Secretary-General’s proposals for regular budget posts
by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

II.29 The Advisory Committee recalls that in paragraph II.39 of its first report on
the proposed programme budget for 2004-20054 it recommended that the number,
frequency, venues, and duration of the meetings of intergovernmental and expert
bodies, as well as committees and subcommittees, related to this programme be



75

A/60/7

reviewed from time to time. The Committee was informed that the issue had been
raised but that there had been no follow-up. The Committee recommends that this
issue be pursued more actively with a view towards better rationalization of
resources for this purpose.

II.30 The Advisory Committee also enquired as to the level of extrabudgetary
resources and was informed that there were no pledging conferences or fund-raising
drives, but that extrabudgetary resources were forecast on the basis of firm
declarations by donors (Governments, non-governmental organizations and the
private sector) for specific purposes such as training courses, workshops, seminars
and symposia on specific activities or programmes. The Committee was further
informed that from January 2004 to June 2005, the Office had organized and
conducted 17 workshops and training courses and that another 8 would be organized
and conducted before the end of the year.

II.31 The Advisory Committee notes that 19 publications are estimated for 2006-
2007. The Committee recommends that a review be undertaken to determine
whether the publication of the print version could in some cases be scaled back
in favour of the electronic version. In addition, greater use should be made of
in-house printing, given the existing capacity in Vienna.

posts is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the budget. A summary
of the total number of posts by source of funds and grade level is

Recommendation on posts

New posts

III.1 The establishment of one P-4 post for the head of the Computerization
Division is requested (A/60/6 (Sect. 7), para. 7.13). The Advisory Committee had
recommended against this post in its first report on the programme budget for 2004-
2005 budget,4 pending the completion of an independent study on how to modernize
the proceedings and workflow processes of the Court requested by the Committee
(see paras. III.11-III.15 below). The Computer Service was subsequently
transformed into the Computerization Division, and the post was resubmitted for
2006-2007. The consultancy study contains a number of recommendations in that
regard. The Committee emphasizes the need to strengthen the capacity of the
Computerization Division for strategizing and planning. The Committee thus
supports the establishment of the P-4 post in order to pursue the development
of an information technology strategy. However, the Committee recommends
that the post be rejustified for the biennium 2008-2009 in the light of progress
achieved.

III.2 The establishment of one P-3 Legal Officer post for the Office of the
President of the Court is proposed (ibid., para. 7.13). The Advisory Committee was
informed that the Legal Officer would serve as a special assistant to the President of
the Court in his dual role as judge and President of the Court. The Committee
recommends approval of the post.

Conversion

III.3 The conversion of two temporary General Service (Other level) posts to
established posts is proposed (ibid., para. 7.13). During the biennium 2004-2005,
the Advisory Committee did not recommend the conversion of these two posts for
clerical and administrative support functions in the Department of Linguistic
Matters and the Department of Press and Information Matters, pending completion
of the consultancy study. The Committee is of the opinion that the



77

A/60/7

implementation of the recommendations of the consultancy study would lead to
tangible streamlining in the administrative and support services provided by
the Registrar’s Office and lead to a redeployment of posts.

Recommendations on non-post resources

Other staff costs

III.4 Other staff costs are estimated at $1,796,900 (before recosting) for 2006-
2007. The bulk of those resources relates to general temporary assistance, estimated
at $152,700, and to temporary assistance for meetings, estimated at $1,554,600.
Although there is a resource reduction of $123,300, the Advisory Committee is
of the opinion that modernization of the Court’s proceedings and workflow
should result in significant additional savings under temporary assistance.
Although the Committee is not recommending a reduction at this time, it
expects that savings will be reported in the next performance report.

Travel

III.5 The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information
provided to it that an amount of $94,800 (before recosting) is proposed for 2006-
2007 for the travel of staff of the Registry, representing an increase of $15,300, or
19.2 per cent, compared with the revised appropriation of $79,500 for 2004-2005.
The Committee trusts that the Court will review its travel programme so as to
achieve economies and to ensure the most efficient utilization of resources. The
Committee recommends a reduction of $15,300 (before recosting).

Communication costs

III.6 The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information
provided to it that an amount of $338,800 has been proposed for communication
costs, including long-distance telephone calls. The Committee is concerned with the
high cost and expects that the Court will make an effort to economize, perhaps by
examining the possibility of Internet-based telephone services. Moreover, the
Committee expects progress in distinguishing between official and personal calls.
The Committee expects an update on this matter in the budget proposal for the
biennium 2008-2009.

ZyImage

III.7 ZyImage is the Court’s principal electronic documentation storage software,
which has been utilized by the Court for the past four years. Regrettably, a number
of fundamental document management problems have not been addressed and the
programme’s full utility to the Court appears limited, in particular in view of the
fact that the program’s only main feature appears to be its searchability. The
consultancy study points to a number of serious gaps, for example inadequate
system maintenance, lack of protocols and security and access risks. The
Committee was informed that there was no coordination with the Information
Technology Services Division of the Secretariat and requests that such support
be pursued urgently to ensure that the problems are addressed expeditiously, as
well as to develop a new software program, should it be required.



78

A/60/7

Cooperation

III.8 The Advisory Committee was informed that informal cooperation existed
with other legal bodies, such as the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia. The Court indicated that close cooperation did not exist owing to the
confidential nature of its work. The Committee points out, however, that the
work of legal bodies is similar with respect to their technical and administrative
requirements, for example regarding staffing, information technology,
archiving, document management and information security. The Committee
expects the Court’s administration to proactively increase cooperation, in
particular in view of other legal bodies’ lessons-learned experiences.

Implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee

Remote (off-site) translation

III.9 The Advisory Committee was informed that some effort was made to obtain
remote, or off-site, translation services from within the United Nations system. The
Committee believes that those efforts should be intensified and better
coordinated and is of the view that the Registry should develop a specific
off-site translation plan rather than relying on ad hoc measures. Furthermore,
the Registry should consult with other United Nations system entities that
utilize off-site translation services to share their knowledge and experience in
this area.

Results-based budgeting and performance appraisal system

III.10 The Advisory Committee notes with satisfaction that results-based budgeting
has been instituted in the non-judicial function of the Registry. The Committee
commends management for implementing the performance appraisal system (PAS)
as an effective management tool encouraging dialogue between supervisors and
staff. Management informed the Committee that despite initial resistance, most staff
at all levels now viewed the PAS as a positive tool for career planning and
development. The Committee encourages the full application of the PAS, including
guidelines for the rating of achievement.

Consultancy study

III.11 As mentioned above, the Advisory Committee requested the Registry of
the Court to initiate an independent consultancy study in the biennium 2002-
2003 and again in 2004-2005. The request was based on the Committee’s
perception of a number of weaknesses in the management of the Court’s
administrative and work processes. The Committee commends the Court for
initiating the study but regrets the four-year delay from the Committee’s
original request in 2001 until the completion of the study in 2005.

III.12 The Advisory Committee was informed that the complete results of the
study were not available until 5 March 2005, too late for inclusion in the
programme budget. The Committee notes, however, that a selective summary of
the study’s recommendations was nonetheless included in table 7.8 of the
budget proposal.



79

A/60/7

III.13 The Advisory Committee points out that the summary did not fully
reflect the gravity of fundamental deficiencies highlighted by the consultancy
study. In particular, the Committee is concerned that the study’s overall
conclusion revealed the need for urgent improvement in the Court’s work
processes, including document and information management and processing.
For example, staff did not participate in available training opportunities,
including secretarial staff who stated that they were not proficient in basic
office software. As noted above, archiving was labour-intensive and no
information technology expertise had been sought from the Secretariat; the
document workflow was hard-copy based; there was no electronic
dissemination of documents; documents for outside translators were hand-
delivered by messenger instead of utilizing e-mail, encrypted if necessary.

III.14 The Advisory Committee is particularly concerned that, as noted above,
these and other matters should have been addressed by management, whose
mandate it is to ensure a lean and efficient operation. Although the Registry
explained that operational changes could not be developed and implemented
owing to a lack of resources, the Committee’s interpretation of the study is that
adequate resources could have been allocated but were not as a result of
outdated business and management practices.

III.15 The Advisory Committee expects that the Registry will expeditiously
address all matters highlighted in the study and will utilize this opportunity to
modernize its administrative operations and processes in a comprehensive and
sustained manner. The Committee looks forward to a presentation of the results
for the biennium 2008-2009.

A/60/7

Recommendations on posts

New posts

III.16 The establishment of one P-2 post in the General Legal Division is requested
under subprogramme 2 (A/60/6 (Sect. 8), para. 8.35). The proposal for this new post
is made pursuant to the recommendation of the Office of Internal Oversight
Services. The Advisory Committee recalls that it had recommended the
establishment of this post in paragraph III.24 of its first report on the programme
budget for 2004-2005.4 The Committee maintains its recommendation in this
respect.

Reclassifications

III.17 One P-3 post of Proofreader is proposed to be downgraded to the P-2 level
(A/60/6 (Sect. 8), para. 8.51). The Advisory Committee has no objection to this
reclassification.

III.18 The upgrading of one P-3 Legal Officer post to the P-4 level is proposed
(ibid.). The Advisory Committee has no objection to this reclassification.

Recommendations on non-post resources

III.19 With reference to travel, the Advisory Committee notes from the
supplementary information provided to it that the amount of $1,163,900 (before
recosting) is proposed for 2006-2007, representing an increase of $220,600, or 23.4
per cent, compared to the revised appropriation of $943,300 for 2004-2005. The
Committee was informed that travel costs included planned travel of temporary staff
for a total duration of four months to support meetings at locations away from
Headquarters, namely travel from Vienna to New York to provide substantive and
technical advice for a four-week session of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) during 2006 and 12 one-week sessions of six
working groups during 2006-2007. The Committee was also informed that
temporary assistance was required for the United Nations Administrative Tribunal
twice each year, a heavier workload was expected for one annual Tribunal session in
New York and one in Geneva; for the latter, a provision for the travel of temporary
staff from New York to Geneva was required.

III.20 With reference to contractual services, the Advisory Committee notes from
the supplementary information provided to it that an amount of $1,695,700 (before
recosting) is proposed for 2006-2007, representing a decrease of $252,900, or 13 per
cent, compared to the revised appropriation of $1,948,600 for 2004-2005. The
Committee commends the Office of Legal Affairs for its effort to avail itself of
the Organization’s internal printing services, thereby reducing proposed
expenditures.

Other comments and recommendations

III.21 With regard to the International Trade Law Division, the Advisory
Committee notes from the supplementary information provided to it that the three
Professional posts (1 D-2, 1 P-5 and 1 P-2) approved for the biennium 2004-2005
had not yet been filled but that efforts were under way to do so. The Advisory
Committee regrets the two-year delay and expects that the posts will be filled



81

A/60/7

expeditiously. The Committee comments on personnel issues, including the
recruitment and placement of staff, in chapter I above.

III.22 The Advisory Committee was informed that as at January 2004 there was a
backlog of 91 treaty volumes and that as at 15 June 2005 the backlog had been
reduced to 54 volumes. The Committee notes that during the biennium 2004-2005 a
target of 23 volumes was projected by the end of 2003. While the Advisory
Committee regrets that the 2003 target could not be met, the Committee
encourages a renewed effort to reduce the backlog to minimum manageable
levels.

III.23 With respect to policymaking organs, the Advisory Committee notes that the
International Law Commission is focusing on several topics on international public
law, such as the responsibility of international organizations and reservations to
treaties, and that the Commission intends to submit to the General Assembly draft
articles on two specific topics, liability and diplomatic protection. Also, the Office
of Legal Affairs is active in servicing meetings of UNCITRAL and provides
expertise for the timely production of legal texts. The resources of the United
Nations Administrative Tribunal will be transferred to section 1 as at 1 January
2006, which is in accordance with General Assembly resolution 59/283. The
Committee commends the secretariat of the United Nations Administrative
Tribunal for developing a global website to provide staff with information
resources on the services provided and the role played by the Tribunal.

† By its resolution 59/277, the General Assembly approved an advance of
$1,092,400 for the United Nations International Research and Training Institute
for the Advancement of Women for 2005. A reduction of this one-time provision
has been applied against grants and contributions in the estimates for 2006-2007.

Recommendations on posts

IV.1 The establishment of one P-3 post is proposed in the Division for Social Policy
and Development, under subprogramme 3 (A/60/6 (Sect. 9), para. 9.62). The post is
proposed in order to provide additional capacity related to the Ad Hoc Committee
on a Comprehensive and Integral International Convention to Promote and Protect
the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities. The Advisory Committee
recognizes the need to enhance the subprogramme’s capacity and recommends
approval of this post.

IV.2 The establishment of one P-3 post is proposed in the Division for Social Policy
and Development, under subprogramme 3 (ibid.). The post is proposed for the
secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. The Advisory Committee
recalls that, for the 2004-2005 biennium, it recommended approval for a P-2 and a
P-3 post for the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum. The Committee also recalls
that at that same time, it reiterated the need to clarify the role of the Department of
Economic and Social Affairs and the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights with regard to indigenous issues (A/58/7, para.
IV.4). In this respect, the Committee notes that the Office of the High Commissioner
also has a dedicated coordinator’s unit for indigenous peoples and minorities, with a
total of nine professional staff funded through regular budget and extrabudgetary
resources; in addition, it undertakes activities in connection with the Working Group
on Indigenous Populations and its related voluntary trust fund. The Committee
regrets that insufficient information was provided in the documentation
submitted to it and during the discussions, on the role of other entities in this
respect and regarding the need to establish another post in the secretariat of
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Therefore, the Committee does not



83

A/60/7

recommend approval of the post. The Committee recommends that general
temporary assistance continue to be used for this function pending a resolution
of any potential duplication or overlap (see paras. IV.11 to IV.14 below).

IV.3 The establishment of one P-5 post is proposed in the Financing for
Development Office, under subprogramme 10 (A/60/6 (Sect. 9), para. 9.97). The
post is sought to provide additional expertise in taxation matters in support of the
Monterrey Consensus, which calls for the strengthening of international tax
cooperation. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of this post.

IV.4 The abolition of two General Service (Other level) posts is proposed in the
Division for Public Administration and Development Management, under
subprogramme 8 (ibid., para. 9.87). Abolition of the posts is sought as a result of
internal restructuring of the Department that took place during the previous
biennium. The functions of the posts were of a secretarial nature. The Advisory
Committee recommends acceptance of the Secretary-General’s request.

IV.5 Proposed redeployments between subprogrammes are described in detail in
paragraphs 9.82 and 9.87 in the programme budget proposal (see table IV.1 below).

Recommendations on non-post resources

IV.6 Under subprogramme 3, proposed requirements for other staff costs amount to
$116,600 (before recosting), which is $6,600 more than the 2004-2005 appropriation
of $110,000. The Advisory Committee notes that the estimate of $116,000 includes
$110,000 for general temporary assistance. The Committee was informed that the
functions for the proposed P-3 posts under subprogramme 3 (see paras. IV.1 and
IV.2 above) were being carried out through the use of general temporary assistance,
although no commensurate reduction was indicated in the programme budget
proposal. In view of the fact that the Committee’s recommending the approval
of one P-3 post and that, therefore, general temporary assistance for this
function would no longer be required, the Committee recommends that other



84

A/60/7

staff costs under subprogramme 3 be reduced by $45,000 (before recosting) in
respect of the P-3 post recommended for approval in paragraph IV. 1 above.

IV.7 Requirements for consultants and experts under section 9 amount to
$4,377,200 (before recosting), which is $55,100 more than the 2004-2005
appropriation of $4,322,100. The Advisory Committee notes the small increase but
points out that extrabudgetary estimates for the same object of expenditure total
$2,500,000.

IV.8 The Advisory Committee received detailed information regarding consultants
and experts under regular budget resources contracted during the 2002-2003 and
2004-2005 bienniums, indicating a general trend. For the 2002-2003 biennium, the
Department issued 208 contracts resulting in 12,075 work days, averaging 58 work
days per contract. To date, for the 2004-2005 biennium, the Department issued 170
contracts, resulting in 8,203 work days averaging 48 work days per contract. For
both bienniums combined, a total of 378 contracts were issued, resulting in 20,278
work days.

IV.9 Table IV.2 below illustrates a summary of consultancies contracted for the
Department of Economic and Social Affairs during the 2002-2003 and 2004-2005
bienniums:

IV.10 The Advisory Committee points out that a total of 579 regular budget
and extrabudgetary posts were available to the Department during the 2004-
2005 biennium. In addition, the nature of the Department’s work is such that it
can be structured and planned well in advance, since it is not crisis or
emergency-driven, as are some other offices with comparable staffing levels



85

A/60/7

within the United Nations system. The Committee notes that the Office of
Internal Oversight Services has undertaken a review of 8 out of 10
subprogrammes and recommends that future operational audit reviews include
a correlative analysis between the functions carried out by approved posts and
the use of consultants. The Committee stresses once again that all efforts should
be made to utilize expertise already available within the Department or within
the United Nations system; further comments on the use of consultants are
contained in chapter I of the present report.

Other comments and recommendations

IV.11 During the review and discussions of the eight sections (9 through 16) of part
IV (International cooperation for development) with representatives of the
Secretary-General, it became apparent that, over the years, the Department of
Economic and Social Affairs has evolved into a unique knowledge bank and
information gathering vehicle that can serve as a resource for the United Nations
system. The Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs
has specialized expertise in the following areas: demographic statistics, national
accounts, international trade statistics, social/gender statistics, industry statistics,
energy statistics, environment statistics and statistical classifications.

IV.12 In table IV.3 below, the Advisory Committee points to specific examples of
areas of apparent duplication in terms of quantitative and qualitative research and
analysis, as well as expertise, among the programmes covered in sections 10
through 16 of part IV.

IV.13 The Advisory Committee points out that the wide variety of data
available through the Department of Economic and Social Affairs can be
utilized to obtain the new statistical information required. For example, a
combination of regional housing, environment and trade statistics can be
tailored to provide useful information for various sections. The Committee has



87

A/60/7

noticed that each organizational entity tends to operate independently instead,
creating data and analyses from scratch. The Committee is of the opinion that
an integrative data management mechanism/system would maximize use of the
Organization’s scarce resources and increase the efficiency with which data can
be made available for a wide range of purposes. Such an approach would also
provide an opportunity for savings on the resources required for publications
since it would permit consolidation and rationalization of the publications
programme for all entities through collaborative and/or dual-use issues.

IV.14 The Advisory Committee therefore recommends that the Department
initiate a comprehensive review, preferably using in-house services provided by
the Office of Internal Oversight Services, to identify quantitative and
qualitative data available, tracing that data to actual client needs with a view to
bringing about the streamlining of and savings on the programmes contained in
part IV of the proposed programme budget.

IV.15 On a related matter, the Advisory Committee points out that the
identification of a dedicated capacity for internal monitoring and evaluation
would be a significant step towards providing day-to-day support to
management. Such a capacity would enhance feedback with intergovernmental
bodies and also determine the efficiency and effectiveness of measures
undertaken as part of the above-mentioned information-sharing and data
management centre project.

IV.16 The Advisory Committee was informed that the estimate for external printing
under section 9 for 2006-2007 is $693,400 (before recosting), which is $10,600
below the 2004-2005 appropriation. While the Committee commends the
Department for initiating reductions, it also believes that significantly higher
reductions could be made and trusts that greater efforts will be undertaken to
plan for the utilization of existing internal printing facilities.

Recommendations on posts

IV.17 The establishment of one P-3 post is proposed in the Landlocked Developing
Countries Unit, under subprogramme 2 (A/60/6 (Sect. 10), para. 10.22). The post is
sought to provide additional support to ensure implementation of the Almaty
Programme, including follow-up and monitoring activities. The Advisory
Committee recommends approval of the post. The Committee trusts that these
functions will also enhance the capacity of the Office of the High
Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing
Countries and Small Island Developing States for cooperation and
collaboration with the entities of the United Nations system, in particular those
engaged in operational development in activities for least developed countries,
landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.

IV.18 Redeployment between sections of the budget, proposed pursuant to
paragraph 14 of resolution 58/270, are described in detail in paragraphs 10.22 and
28A.20 in the programme budget proposal. They would involve inward
redeployment of one P-5 post from section 28A, Office of the Under-Secretary-
General for Management, to section 10, Least developed countries, landlocked
developing countries and small island developing States, under subprogramme 2,
Landlocked developing countries, in exchange for the outward redeployment of one
P-4 post to section 28A (A/60/6 (Sect. 10), para. 10.22 and A/60/6 (Sect. 28A), para.
28A.20). The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of these
redeployments between sections.

Recommendations on non-post resources

IV.19 Requirements for consultants and experts amount to $116,500 (before
recosting), which is $18,000 (13.4 per cent) less than the 2004-2005 appropriation
of $134,500. In its previous report (A/58/7, para. IV.40), the Advisory Committee
expressed its expectation that the Office of the High Representative would make
every effort to use research materials and other information already available, for
example from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, United
Nations funds and programmes, and the specialized agencies, to optimize the use of
the small professional capacity of the Office and to avoid duplication. The
Committee appreciates the reduction that has been achieved and trusts that
efforts will continue to utilize already available expertise within the United
Nations system to the extent possible (see chap. I above).

Other comments and recommendations

IV.20 With regard to extrabudgetary activities, the Advisory Committee was
informed that the Office’s trust fund was used to ensure the participation by
representatives of least developed countries in various conferences and meetings, in
particular at locations away from Headquarters. The Committee was also informed
that, with a view to the Office’s ongoing requirements, resource mobilization has
been effective and that resources were committed to recipient countries and were
expected to be sufficient to carry out activities earmarked for financing through the
trust fund.

IV.21 The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that collaboration between the
Office and other entities of the United Nations system, such as the Department
of Economic and Social Affairs, the United Nations Development Programme



89

A/60/7

(UNDP), the Economic Commission for Africa and/or other regional
commissions and UNCTAD, on United Nations support for the New Partnership
for Africa’s Development would greatly enhance its work and avoid duplicative
activities, particularly in the area of information-gathering. The Committee
points out that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs already provides
related expertise, which could augment the Office’s work and avoid
duplication. For example, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs provides
expert advisory services to developing countries, small island developing States and
countries with economies in transition for capacity-building (A/60/6 (Sect. 9), para.
9.67 (c) (i)). In addition, UNCTAD undertakes similar activities through its Special
Programme for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked and Transit Developing
Countries, Small Island Developing States and Structurally Weak, Vulnerable and
Small Economies. The Committee trusts that the Office will proactively seek
collaboration with other entities of the United Nations system, to identify areas
of mutual cooperation and to regularize the sharing of information and
expertise and that an update will be provided for the 2008-2009 biennium.
Additional comments of the Committee on the matter are contained in section 9
above.

Section 11
United Nations support for the New Partnership for
Africa’s Development

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $10,322,200*

grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present text, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

IV.22 Requirements for consultants and experts amount to $708,100 (before
recosting), which is $18,900 (2.7 per cent) more than the 2004-2005 appropriation
of $689,200. Extrabudgetary estimates for consultants and experts are indicated at
$230,000, which is $105,000 higher than the 2004-2005 estimate of $125,000. The
Advisory Committee trusts that the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa will
make every effort to use research material, as well as other resources already widely
available on matters related to the region, for example from the Economic
Commission for Africa, UNCTAD, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, United Nations funds and programmes
and the specialized agencies, to optimize the use of the small professional capacity
of the office and to avoid duplication. The Committee further comments on
information-sharing in its discussion of section 9 (Economic and social affairs). The



90

A/60/7

Committee was informed that, in general, partnering activities with other entities are
in their infancy. In view of the presence of other United Nations entities in the
region dealing with African issues, the Committee encourages the Office to be
proactive in identifying partnering opportunities. Furthermore, the Committee
trusts that the Office will develop integrative networks to enhance regional
activities and capacity-building in support of a system-wide approach.

IV.23 Under subprogramme 2, Regional coordination of and support for the New
Partnership for Africa’s Development, specialized consultancy services are proposed
for a review of the United Nations system-wide support to the implementation of the
New Partnership. The Advisory Committee believes that this expertise, as well as
the necessary institutional memory and knowledge, already exist within the United
Nations system. The Committee trusts that efforts will be made to utilize
available expertise and resources within the United Nations system.

IV.24 Requirements for contractual services amount to $436,500 (before recosting),
which is $56,000 (14.7 per cent) more than the 2004-2006 appropriation of
$380,500. Extrabudgetary estimates for contractual services are indicated at
$90,000. This object of expenditure includes costs for external editing, translation
and printing. The Advisory Committee points out that in-house services should
be sought in this regard. If it is perceived that translation cannot be provided
internally within a reasonable time frame, there should be recourse to
contractual translation services through the Contractual Translation Unit of
the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management. This
matter is discussed in more detail under section 2 of the present report.

Other comments and observations

IV.25 The Advisory Committee notes that, through the Department of Public
Information, the Office is undertaking public relations and information
dissemination activities on regional and subregional matters; this includes the
publication of a quarterly periodical (Africa Renewal) and the website of the Office
of the Special Adviser on Africa (www.un.org/africa/osaa). The Committee was
informed that, to date, no performance or client satisfaction measures had been
developed to ensure the effectiveness of these activities and trusts that the Office
will endeavour to do so.

IV.26 The Advisory Committee recommends that the organization chart at the
end of the fascicle for section 11 be reformatted so as to show the true linkage
between the Office of the Special Adviser, the Economic Commission for Africa
and the Department of Public Information.

Recommendations on posts

IV.27 The Advisory Committee notes that a number of new posts, one
reclassification, one redeployment and abolition of several posts were
requested. Explanations provided in this respect in the programme budget
proposal were too general. In point of fact, throughout the fascicle there was a
lack of supporting justification of the operational necessity for proposed action
on these posts. For example, the proposal to establish two P-2 posts was
explained as filling the need “to strengthen the subprogramme in the area of
statistics to better respond to mandates emerging from the eleventh session of
the Conference”. The Committee further comments on the P-2 post in
paragraph IV.29 below. No other pertinent information was provided. The
Committee trusts that, in future, proposals for action on posts will be presented
with precise supporting justification.

IV.28 The establishment of one P-3 post is proposed in the Division on
Globalization and Development Strategies, under subprogramme 1 (A/60/6 (Sect.
12), para. 12.37). The programme budget proposal indicates that the post is sought
in response to additional requirements from the São Paulo Consensus. The Advisory
Committee was informed that the request for a P-3 level post is the minimum
requirement to meet demands of the subprogramme, which is responsible for the
substantive analysis of African development issues and produces an annual report,
Economic Development in Africa. The Committee notes that staffing of
subprogramme 1 includes 13 P-4/P-3 posts; UNCTAD as a whole has 126 P-4/P-3
posts. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the function be met
through redeployment.

IV.29 The establishment of two P-2 posts are proposed in the Division on
Investment, Technology and Enterprise Development, under subprogramme 2 (ibid.,
para. 12.42). The two new posts are sought to strengthen the subprogramme in the
area of statistics. The Advisory Committee points to the considerable resources
of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs in the area of statistics, as
well as the possibilities for collaboration with IMF and the World Bank in
compiling quantitative and qualitative information in various areas. The



92

A/60/7

Committee points out that a total of 579 regular budget and extrabudgetary
posts were available at the Department of Economic and Social Affairs during
the 2004-2005 biennium, including a total of 123 posts for its subprogramme 5
(Statistics). The Committee comments on information-sharing and coordination
opportunities below and in further detail in its discussion of section 9 above.
Furthermore, the Committee notes that the staff resources of subprogramme 2
are already considerable, with 35 posts at the P-4/P-3 level and 9 posts at the
P-2/P-1 level for the 2004-2005 biennium. The Committee does not therefore
recommend approval of the two P-2 posts requested.

IV.30 The establishment of one P-4 post is proposed for the Special Programme for
Least Developed Countries, Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries, Small
Island Developing States and Structurally Weak, Vulnerable and Small Economies,
under subprogramme 5 (ibid., para. 12.60). The new post is sought to assist with the
annual report on the least developed countries and to undertake research and policy
analysis in this respect. The Advisory Committee notes that an inward
redeployment of another P-4 post is proposed for the same purpose (see para.
IV.34 below). To avoid duplicative efforts, the Committee recommends that
UNCTAD proactively seek a collaborative agreement with the Office of the
High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing
Countries and Small Island Developing States. The Committee comments
further on this matter in its discussions of sections 9 and 10 above. Subject to
the foregoing, the Committee recommends approval to establish the new P-4
post.

IV.31 The establishment of one P-2 post is proposed for an Information Systems
Officer, under programme management (ibid., para. 12.67). The new post is sought
to increase the level of qualified technical expertise for information technology, in
conjunction with the proposal to abolish one related General Service (Other level)
post. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of this post.

IV.32 The reclassification of one P-5 post to the D-1 level is proposed in the
Special Programme for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing
Countries, Small Island Developing States and Structurally Weak, Vulnerable and
Small Economies, under subprogramme 5 (ibid., para. 12.60). The proposed
programme budget indicates that the upward reclassification is sought to strengthen
work under the subprogramme. However, no additional explanation or
justification was provided, either in the budget proposal or in the
accompanying supplementary information. Upon inquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the P-5 incumbent would assume additional
responsibilities related to the production of the annual report on the least
developed countries and that a reclassification of the P-5 post to the D-1 level
was sought to reflect that added responsibility. Furthermore, the Committee
was informed that a post at the P-5 level would not be sufficiently senior and
that a D-1 post would be required to meet substantive, managerial and
supervisory responsibility for all the research and policy analysis of the Special
Programme. The Committee notes, however, that senior substantive leadership
within the Special Programme is already assured with an existing D-2 post,
providing the required substantive coordination and guidance on research and
analysis. Accordingly, the Committee recommends against the reclassification.



93

A/60/7

IV.33 The Advisory Committee recommends approval for the abolishment of
the following posts, which are, in general, being relinquished due to overall
productivity increases resulting from new information technology and
increased computer skills. With the exception of the General Service (Other
level) post under programme support, which is to be replaced by a new P-2 post
for an Information Systems Officer, the Committee trusts that these abolitions
will not lead to further requests for new professional posts to perform
essentially the same functions:

(a) Two General Service (Other level) posts, Division on Globalization and
Development Strategies, under subprogramme 1 (ibid., para. 12.37);

(b) Three General Service (Other level) posts, Division on Investment,
Technology and Enterprise Development, under subprogramme 2 (ibid., para.
12.42);

(c) One General Service (Other level) posts, Division on International
Trade in Goods and Services, and Commodities, under subprogramme 3 (ibid., para.
12.48);

(d) One General Service (Other level) post, under programme support
(ibid., para. 12.67).

IV.34 Two proposed redeployments between subprogrammes are described in detail
in paragraph 12.60 in the programme budget proposal (see table IV.4 below).

Recommendations on non-post resources

IV.35 An amount of $1,292,600 (before recosting) is proposed for 2006-2007 for
travel of staff, representing an increase of $42,200 or 3.4 per cent, compared to the



94

A/60/7

revised appropriation of $1,250,400 for 2004-2005. The Advisory Committee was
informed that travel for the collection of quantitative and qualitative data was
routinely undertaken but that electronic means of communication, such as the
Internet and videoconferencing, were also used. However, it appears to the
Committee that travel costs have been unaffected as a result of the latter. The
Committee recommends that UNCTAD closely monitor its travel-related
expenses and identify areas for economies. The Committee recommends
maintaining budgetary resources for the travel of staff at the 2004-2005 level,
this represents a reduction of $42,200 (before recosting).

IV.36 The Advisory Committee notes that resources for programme support,
including executive direction and management, amount to approximately 27 per cent
of the total programme budget estimate of $112,530,900 (before recosting). The
Committee notes a steadily increasing trend since 2002-2003, notwithstanding the
fact that the budget estimate for 2006-2007 indicates a slight decrease. The
Committee was informed that a ratio of approximately one-fourth of programme
support costs to programme of work costs was appropriate. From information
provided to it, the Committee notes that a three-year (2005-2007) evaluation plan is
under way, focusing on substantive matters. The Committee was also informed that
the latest comprehensive review by the Office of Internal Oversight Services was
undertaken during 1995. The Committee points out that procedures should be in
place to ensure a lean and efficient operation and that guidelines on internal
programme performance assessment in results-based management are readily
available through the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The Committee is
of the opinion that a follow-up review should be undertaken and that there
should be routine operational audits and reviews to help identify opportunities
for further efficiencies and economies in both the administrative and
substantive components, including the elimination of duplication with other
bodies in the area of statistics and related publications. The Committee further
comments on information sharing and opportunities for coordination in its
discussion under section 9 above.

IV.37 An amount of $1,763,800 (before recosting) is proposed for consultants and
experts for 2006-2007, representing a decrease of $238,700 or 11.9 per cent,
compared to the revised appropriation of $2,002,500 for 2004-2005. Detailed
information regarding consultants from January 2004 to May 2005 provided to the
Advisory Committee indicated that the Office hired 93 consultants for a total of
5,877 working days during 17 months. It could not be ascertained whether some
consultants were hired more than once. Some consultancy services were obtained in
areas where expertise from within the United Nations system is available; for
example, for editing, proofreading and translation. In one instance, UNCTAD hired
consultants for a total of 10 working days to translate two press releases. The
Committee points out that a total of 431 regular budget and extrabudgetary
posts were available to UNCTAD during the 2004-2005 biennium. Also, the
nature of the work is such that it can be structured and planned well in
advance, since it is not crisis or emergency-driven, as are other offices with
comparable staffing levels within the United Nations system. The Committee is
concerned that in view of the fact that the latest review by the Office of Internal
Oversight Services was undertaken some time ago, work flows and
responsibilities may be assigned to consultants for lack of a long-term
managerial strategic plan. Although the Committee does not recommend a



95

A/60/7

further reduction of the requirements for consultants and experts, it expects
that strict attention will be paid to the guidelines for their use. The Committee
further comments on the use of consultants in chapter I to the present report.

Other comments and recommendations

IV.38 The Advisory Committee notes that opportunities exist for information
sharing with various organizations, such as the World Customs Union, the World
Tourist Organization, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs or the World
Trade Organization and that a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2003
with the latter. The Committee emphasizes that a wide variety of trade and
development raw and processed statistical data is already available from various
sources for use and analysis by decision makers. However, particularly in the area of
statistics, the compilation and quantitative and qualitative analysis of statistical
information is undertaken with separate resources and seemingly separate objectives
although such information is overlapping and not mutually exclusive. Primary
statistical data for trade and development is compiled by the Department of
Economic and Social Affairs for non-recurrent and recurrent publications such as
the Yearbook of International Trade Statistics or the newsletter on international
trade in services (A/60/6 (Sect. 9), para. 9.71,(b)(i)). Moreover, technical materials
can be obtained from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and others,
including international trade statistics and classifications, as well as resources
available via a standardized statistical metadata exchange and collaboration with
IMF and other relevant institutions in an inter-agency working group, as noted under
section 9 (A/60/6 (Sect. 9), para. 9.71,(b)(iii)). The Committee recommends that
UNCTAD, in collaboration with the Department of Economic and Social
Affairs, define its goals for regular information-sharing and initiate an in-depth
review to ascertain specific areas of duplication. The Committee further
comments on information-sharing in section 9 (Economic and social affairs).
The Committee anticipates an update in this respect for the 2008-2009
biennium.

Section 13
International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO

IV.39 The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in section I of
resolution 59/276 of 23 December 2004, endorsed revised administrative
arrangements for the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC) as proposed
by the Secretary-General and recommended by the Committee (A/59/543). Pursuant
to that resolution, ITC will no longer be required to submit a budget outline. The
Secretary-General has accordingly submitted a preliminary estimate to
accommodate the programme of activities of ITC for the biennium 2006-2007
(A/60/6 (Sect. 13)), as called for in that resolution. Expressed in 2004-2005 foreign
exchange rates, the proposed estimated requirements for ITC for 2006-2007 amount
to 65,540,400 Swiss francs (SwF) (combined World Trade Organization and United
Nations shares), with a projected income of SwF 470,000 for the biennium. On that
basis the contribution from both the World Trade Organization and the United
Nations would amount to SwF 32,535,200 each for the biennium.

IV.40 The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly take
note of the resources proposed in the preliminary budget estimate, including a



96

A/60/7

request for two new professional posts (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) to reinforce the
activities of ITC (A/60/6 (Sect. 13), para. 13.5).

IV.41 As indicated in paragraph 13.8 of the preliminary budget estimate, a detailed
proposed programme budget for ITC for the biennium 2006-2007 will be submitted
to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.

budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

IV.42 The establishment of one P-3 post is proposed for the Secretary of the
Governing Bodies of the United Nations Environment Programme in the Office of
the Executive Director (A/60/6 (Sect. 14), para. 14.24). The new post is sought to
provide secretariat support to the Group of 77 and China with a focus, inter alia, on
administrative, budgetary and protocol matters. This request for a new P-3 post
represents a transfer from extrabudgetary to regular budget resources. Taking
into account the importance of these functions to ensure an efficient and
effective intergovernmental decision-making, the Advisory Committee
recommends approval of the new P-3 post.

Other comments and recommendations

IV.43 The Advisory Committee points out that it has been calling for a review of
the need for multiple liaison offices since its first report on the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 1997-19988 (see paras. 115 and 116 of that report); the
latest recommendation in this respect was in paragraph 106 of its report for the
biennium 2004-20054. The Committee regrets that no action was initiated following
its repeated recommendation and notes that UNEP maintains a Regional Office for
North America in Washington, D.C., as well as a liaison office in New York City.
Although the Committee understands that the Global Environment Fund is
headquartered in Washington, D.C., it believes that it does not add any
significant value to continue operating from two locations in such close
geographic proximity. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that a
relocation of the UNEP Regional Office for North America to New York City be
considered in order to take advantage of the immediate proximity of United



97

A/60/7

Nations funds and programmes relevant to its activities and to avoid
duplication of efforts. Liaison activities may then be coordinated from the
UNEP consolidated North American Office.

IV.44 The Advisory Committee notes from additional information provided to it
that after the Department of Peacekeeping Operations contacted UNEP in 2002,
joint visits to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone and the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon were undertaken. The resulting environmental guidelines
were to be made available to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and field
missions during 2005. The Advisory Committee commends both UNEP and the
Department for collaborating on this important matter. The Committee regrets,
however, that the original initiative was undertaken by the Department and not
by UNEP, and then only very recently, in 2002. The Committee trusts that
UNEP will, in future, offer its expertise proactively to field operations, whether
of a peacekeeping or humanitarian nature, and will continue to provide
guidance to monitor environmental standards of United Nations system
operations.

IV.45 The Advisory Committee was informed that the scope of the UNEP
evaluation and oversight function comprises the programmes and projects of the
Environment Fund and related trust funds, as well as projects of the Global
Environment Facility that are implemented by UNEP. The Evaluation and Oversight
Unit is comprised of one P-5 (Chief), one P-4 (Evaluation Officer), one Junior
Professional Officer and three General Service (Other level) staff. With regard to the
2006-2007 work plan, two subprogramme evaluations, three management studies as
well as other evaluations are scheduled. Meanwhile, work on the biennial evaluation
report is scheduled to be carried out from October 2007 to January 2008.

IV.46 The Advisory Committee notes that, despite the increased workload
associated with the production of a major publication, no additional resources for
the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation are
proposed. Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that UNEP would provide
additional resources, through redeployment, to ensure that the Scientific Committee
can fulfil its mandate and meet its sole indicator of achievement.

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget

budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present text, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

IV.47 The establishment of one P-4 post is proposed for a Programme and
Management Oversight Officer in the Governing Council of the United Nations
Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), (A/60/6 (Sect. 15), para. 15.20). The
new post is proposed for the following functions: inspection activities for
programme and field activities; monitoring of implementation of oversight
recommendations and preparing documentation required by the Internal Oversight
Committee and other bodies; programme advice and support; and training
(programme-related activities). The Advisory Committee recalls that, for the
purposes of monitoring and evaluation, one P-5 post was approved under
subprogramme 2 in the biennium 2004-2005, following the approval of two similar-
function posts (1 P-5 and 1 P-4) under subprogramme 2 in 2002-2003. The
Committee notes that the UN-Habitat monitoring and evaluation functions are
dispersed across subprogrammes. The Committee was informed that the proposed
P-4 post would assume functions within the monitoring and evaluation unit under
the Office of the Executive Director. The Committee also comments in paragraph
IV.51 below on the need to review and streamline the monitoring and evaluation
functions of UN-Habitat in order to avoid duplicative efforts, resulting in the
uneconomical use of the Organization’s scarce financial resources. The Committee
therefore recommends that the functions envisioned for the proposed P-4 post
be carried out through redeployment or a redistribution of responsibilities, but
stands ready to reconsider a rejustification of the post for the 2008-2009
biennium. The Committee also recommends that UN-Habitat seek assistance
from the Office of Internal Oversight Services, as well as from UNEP, with
regard to best practices and guidance in organizing a monitoring and
evaluation function. In this regard, the Committee recalls the in-depth
evaluation of UN-Habitat carried out by the Office of Internal Oversight
Services (E/AC.51/2005/3), in particular paragraphs 68 to 70 on monitoring and
evaluation.

IV.48 The establishment of one P-3 post is proposed for a Human Settlements
Officer in the Monitoring and Research Division (ibid., para. 15.31). The Advisory



99

A/60/7

Committee was informed that the new post is sought to strengthen the Partners and
Youth Section to strengthen dialogue with a variety of Habitat Agenda partners. The
Committee recommends approval of the post.

IV.49 The outward redeployment of one P-4 post in the Shelter and Sustainable
Human Settlements Development Division, under subprogramme 1, to the
Monitoring and Research Division, under subprogramme 2 is proposed (ibid., para.
15.26). The redeployment is sought to provide support for UN-Habitat flagship
reports, including the Global Report on Human Settlements and Habitat Debate.
The Advisory Committee notes that for the 2004-2005 biennium, UN-Habitat
received a new P-4 post for subprogramme 1, but that for the 2006-2007
biennium, one P-4 post in the same subprogramme was proposed for outward
redeployment. The Committee therefore questions whether a new P-4 was
operationally required during the 2004-2005 biennium. The Committee regrets
that resources made available by the General Assembly were apparently left
idle and that no strategic approach was developed in this respect. The
Committee trusts that UN-Habitat will present a well-developed strategy on
management of staff resources in the next programme budget proposal,
including a proper organization chart indicating offices below the Division
level.

Other comments and recommendations

IV.50 The Advisory Committee notes that three UN-Habitat liaison offices are
currently operational, namely in Brussels, Geneva, and New York City. The
Committee points out that it has been calling for a review of the need for multiple
liaison offices since its first report on the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 1997-19988 (see paras. 115 and 116 of that report); the latest
recommendation in this respect was in paragraph 106 of its report for the biennium
2004-20054. The Committee regrets that no action was initiated following its
repeated recommendation and notes that the two liaison offices in Europe, in
Geneva and Brussels, are in close geographic proximity and within easy reach of
each other. The Committee believes that consolidating the UN-Habitat European
liaison functions into one location would result in significant cost savings, taking
into account any additional travel costs or communication costs, for example
videoconferences, that would incur as a result. The Committee recommends that
UN-Habitat address the issue of streamlining its European liaison offices with
the possibility of consolidating their operations in one location.

IV.51 In addition to a monitoring and evaluation unit in the Office of the Executive
Director, identical activities are also dispersed among the various subprogrammes.
Information provided to the Advisory Committee clarified that the Monitoring and
Research Division under subprogramme 2 is responsible for substantive and external
programme activities, while the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit located under
Executive Direction and Management addresses internal activities related to the
Programme’s overall management. The Committee nevertheless believes that
combining monitoring and evaluation functions, perhaps using the UNEP
approach as a guideline, would offer UN-Habitat management better control
over all of its subprogrammes and would therefore greatly enhance the Office’s
strategic planning capabilities. The Committee recommends that UN-Habitat
consider streamlining and restructuring its monitoring and evaluation



100

A/60/7

functions into a centrally managed unit to be responsible for such functions for
all subprogrammes.

IV.52 The Advisory Committee notes that over the last three bienniums (2002-
2003, 2004-2005 and 2006-2007) there has been a significant increase in non-
recurrent publications, that is from 49 non-recurrent publications in 2002-2003 to an
estimated 156 in 2006-2007. The Committee was informed that UN-Habitat does not
currently have a mechanism in place to determine the effectiveness of its
publications for the end-user. In view of the increasing staff and financial
resources expended, the Committee recommends that UN-Habitat develop tools
to evaluate the usefulness of its publications. Similarly, UN-Habitat undertakes
regular exhibitions to provide information to experts and the general public. In
this respect, it would also be helpful to initiate a systematic evaluation of
customer satisfaction and general impact on those who visit its exhibits and use
the information provided.

budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present text, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

IV.53 The establishment of one P-4 post is proposed in the Division for Policy
Analysis and Public Affairs, under subprogramme 1 (A/60/6 (Sect. 16), para. 16.36).
The Advisory Committee was informed that the new post is sought to enhance in-
house capacity for the publication of the World Crime Report, a newly consolidated
biennial publication to be issued in response to General Assembly resolution
59/159. The Committee recommends approval of this post.

IV.54 The establishment of one P-4 post is proposed in the Sustainable Livelihoods
Unit of the Division for Operations, under subprogramme 3 (ibid., para. 16.46). The
post is proposed in support of strategy development and the promotion of best
practices, as well as financing-related activities. The Advisory Committee was
informed that the responsibilities will include the provision of policy advice to all
programmes; however, the Committee was informed that responsibilities will focus
mostly on technical assistance projects, which are becoming increasingly important
for the programme. The Committee accordingly recommends approval of this
post.

IV.55 Proposed redeployments between subprogrammes are described in detail in
paragraphs 16.36 and 16.41 in the programme budget proposal (see table IV.5

Recommendations on non-post resources

IV.56 An amount of $1,442,500 (before recosting) is proposed under consultants
and experts for 2006-2007, representing an increase of $67,600 or 4.9 per cent
compared to the revised appropriation of $1,374,900 for 2004-2005. The Advisory
Committee was informed that in the past activities related to crime surveys had been
assumed via consultancies, but would now be carried out by the above-mentioned
proposed new P-4 post in the Division for Policy Analysis and Public Affairs under
subprogramme 1. In the light of its recommendation to approve that post, the
Committee recommends that the estimate for consultants be maintained at the
2004-2005 level; this represents a reduction of $67,600 (before recosting) for
2006-2007.

IV.57 The Advisory Committee notes that UNODC’s two flagship publications, the
World Drug Report and the World Crime Report, are gratis distributions. The
Committee was informed that a request to the Department of Public Information
some years ago to determine the saleability of the Office’s publications had not been
approved. The Committee recommends that the Office request the Publications
Board to address the matter again.

IV.58 An amount of $795,400 (before recosting) is proposed under travel of staff
2006-2007, representing an increase of $21,200 or 2.7 per cent, compared to the
revised appropriation of $774,200 for 2004-2005. The supplementary information
provided to the Advisory Committee described travel requirements only in general
terms. For example, an estimated increase of $74,100 was projected under
subprogramme 2, Services for policymaking and treaty adherence, however, the
narrative was limited to a description of how travel requirements relate to the
Office’s overall mandate. The Committee trusts that for the 2008-2009 biennium,
travel plans will be more specific. Ideally, a presentation of travel plans would
include details on the number of staff travelling, the duration of the trip, the
destination, as well as a description and justification of the activity. The Committee
recommends that requirements for the travel of staff be maintained at the 2004-
2005 level; this represents a reduction of $21,200 (before recosting) for 2006-
2007.



102

A/60/7

IV.59 For contractual services under subprogramme 1, Research, analysis and
advocacy, an amount of $266,300 (before recosting) is estimated for the 2007-2008
biennium, an increase of $95,900 over the 2004-2005 appropriation of $170,400.
Supplementary information provided to the Advisory Committee indicates that that
this amount was required for the external production of publications. The
Committee was subsequently informed that, while external to the Office, printing
activities were still undertaken within the United Nations system at the facilities of
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under common services
arrangements at the United Nations Office at Vienna. The Committee trusts that
this matter will be clarified in the narrative of future programme budget
proposals.

Other comments and recommendations

IV.60 The Advisory Committee notes that section 16 represents the first effort to
combine drug control, crime prevention and criminal justice. The Committee
commends this presentation. However, further improvements could still be made,
for example by including performance indicators, absent in the presentation, for
monitoring initiatives and goals relative to UNODC outlined in the Secretary-
General’s Millennium Report (A/54/2000). The Committee expects that this
matter will be rectified in the 2008-2009 programme budget proposal.

IV.61 The UNODC liaison office in New York covers North America in general,
including Washington, D.C. The Advisory Committee commends the Office for
initiating action in response to its past recommendations to streamline the
operations of liaison offices. In this respect, the Committee believes that further
consolidation would be possible by combining liaison activities with other
entities, such as UNEP, which also maintains a liaison office in New York City.
The Committee notes that the Liaison Office was downsized by redeploying the
extrabudgetary D-1 post to the UNODC Regional Office in Central Asia. The
existing P-5 post subsequently assumed the representative function of the Liaison
Office.

IV.62 The Advisory Committee notes that UNODC activities for monitoring and
evaluation are exclusively funded through extrabudgetary resources and primarily
focus on the assessment of technical cooperation. The activities are almost
exclusively field-based.

A/60/7

Part V
Regional cooperation for development

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $421,406,500

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $395,309,400

Projected extrabudgetary resources $86,076,800

General comments on part V

V.1 The Advisory Committee notes that the overall resources requested by the
Secretary-General before recosting amount to $396,091,900, representing an
increase of $782,500, or 0.2 per cent over the previous biennium. These resources
are supplemented by those of the regular programme of technical cooperation (see
sect. 22 below) and the Development Account (see part XIII below). The
Committee is of the opinion that a cross-reference to the technical cooperation
and Development Account projects and funds, where relevant, in the individual
sections on the regional commissions would provide a more complete picture of
activities and resources and add transparency to the budget proposals.

V.2 The Advisory Committee stresses once again the importance that it
attaches to improving cost-effectiveness and to reducing administrative support
costs in order to obtain the maximum effectiveness for substantive activities
related to the programme of work. Table V.1 shows that the average share of
administrative support costs is 42 per cent of the total regular budget resources,
varying from 20 per cent to over 50 per cent in the individual commissions. The
Committee recognizes that efforts have been made to improve this proportion
and that some positive gains have been achieved. However, as these rates show,
much remains to be done, and the Committee urges all regional commissions to
pursue vigorously their efforts to reduce the share of administrative costs even
further. In this regard, the Committee commends the Economic Commission
for Europe (ECE) for its comparatively low ratio of 20.3 per cent and the
efforts of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), which proposes to
redeploy three Professional posts from programme support to substantive
activities.

Note: Based on updated information supplied to the Advisory Committee.

V.3 The Advisory Committee was informed that estimates provided for
extrabudgetary resources reflect firm commitments received at the time of the
budget preparation and that the commissions expect that the final amounts raised
will be considerably higher. However, even from the provisional data supplied at
this stage, the Committee notes diverging trends, with some commissions, such as
the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the
Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) showing increases
and others, on the contrary, showing diminishing extrabudgetary resources. Despite
the difficulties which have traditionally been experienced in forecasting the level of
extrabudgetary resources to be made available (see chap. I above, paras. 103-109), a
closer examination of the sources of the extrabudgetary resources shows a trend
towards decreased financing from United Nations funds and programmes such as
UNDP and UNFPA. In this regard, the Advisory Committee maintains that it is
of paramount importance that the regional commissions strive to remain
attractive partners for donors in an increasingly competitive environment,
ensuring that their work and areas of expertise do not duplicate or overlap
those of others. From this standpoint also, it is essential to improve cost-
effectiveness and to reduce the proportion of resources consumed by
administrative support functions.

V.4 The Advisory Committee notes the progress made in the review and
production of publications in response to an Office of Internal Oversight Services
recommendation (A/58/785, para. 83) as well as its own remarks on publications
(A/58/7, para. V.4). It was informed that in 2004 the Department of Economic and
Social Affairs had initiated a comprehensive review of the publications proposed by
the economic commissions with a view to avoiding duplication. As a result of these



105

A/60/7

reviews, most regional commissions have considerably reduced the number of
publications to be produced, distinguishing between recurrent and non-recurrent
publications, and focused more attention on their flagship publications. The
Committee further notes that the commissions have also started to make more
publications available electronically through their websites. The Committee
welcomes this progress. It encourages the commissions to continue to review the
relevance and quality of their publications on an ongoing basis with a view to
further streamlining the activities related to the production of their
publications. In this regard, the Committee draws attention to the recent measures
to revitalize the Publications Board (ST/SGB/2005/15), which is the standard-
setting body for United Nations publications, and to the necessity of conforming to
the procedures and standards set by the Board.

V.5 The Advisory Committee notes that all the commissions either have or will
have in the near future adequate connectivity and installations for full data, voice
and videoconferencing communications with Headquarters, and in most cases with
their subregional offices as well. The Committee was informed that
videoconferencing was used with increasing frequency for a variety of purposes,
such as meetings with Headquarters, meetings between the regional headquarters
and subregional offices, other technical meetings and interviewing candidates, and
that the overall coordination between headquarters and subregional offices had
greatly improved. Information technology and electronic means of communication
are also now widely available and used in all regional and subregional offices. At
this stage, the Committee notes that these investments in information and
communication technology (ICT) infrastructure have not yet produced any
discernible reductions in the costs for travel of staff or pouch services. It trusts
that all commissions will actively seek to use these alternative means of
communication whenever possible, as a matter of routine, in order to limit
travel and thereby improve cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The Committee
reiterates the obligation for all commissions to coordinate closely with
Headquarters on all technical matters regarding videoconferencing and
information technology infrastructure and to apply United Nations ICT
standards so as to avoid unnecessary costs.

V.6 The Advisory Committee has consistently emphasized the importance of
interregional interaction and collaboration (A/58/7, para. V.5) and requested that the
regional commissions intensify their efforts for collaboration among themselves and
for coordination within the United Nations system. In its audit of the regional
commissions (A/58/785), the Office of Internal Oversight Services issued a series of
recommendations on the development of common standards and the establishment
of mechanisms for exchanging best practices and lessons learned. The Office also
recommended that the Executive Secretaries of the regional commissions agree on a
common policy and harmonized methodologies for carrying out self-evaluations, for
follow-up on the findings and for reporting on the findings through the results-based
framework. The Committee notes that most of regional commissions have reported
individually on the actions undertaken in response to some of these
recommendations. The Committee requests that the commissions collaborate
closely to develop and adopt common policies and methods for monitoring and
self-evaluation, which will allow meaningful comparisons between the
commissions.



106

A/60/7

V.7 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the formal channels
for exchanging information and coordination between the regional commissions
included (a) regular meetings of the Executive Secretaries, mandated by the
Economic and Social Council supported by the Regional Commissions New York
Office; (b) the forum of chiefs of programme planning; and (c) regular contacts
between focal points designated in all substantive areas in their respective
secretariats. The Committee was informed that the Executive Secretaries meet
several times a year at the margins of other high-level meetings. Recently, the focal
points have focused on coordinating follow-up to global conferences and summits,
including in relation to the Millennium Development Goals. Since 2003 the chiefs
of programme planning have collaborated to develop guidelines for the preparation
of the strategic framework and greater coherence in programme planning. A number
of other arrangements for collaboration on specific topics also exist, such as the
development of a training guidebook on disability statistics developed jointly by the
Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), ESCAP and ESCWA.

V.8 The Advisory Committee welcomes this progress and notes that the
communication channels in place are well adapted for close cooperation among
the commissions. However, the Committee is of the opinion that collaboration
among the commissions could be further intensified and that greater synergies
could be found through the development and adoption of common policies and
methods and the regular sharing of experiences, lessons learned, workload and
tools developed. The Committee requests that a consolidated report on the
actions undertaken and progress made towards the adoption of common
policies and methodologies be presented in the next proposed programme
budget.

V.9 In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that as a general rule, little
information is provided on the tools used for monitoring and evaluating the
effectiveness of reports, publications, networks and other products delivered by the
subprogrammes, or other methodologies, such as outcome mapping, used to assess
the contribution of the outcomes of the programme to the achievement of the
broader, overarching goal of development or the Millennium Development Goals.
These types of tools, specifically designed for monitoring and evaluating
development programmes, should be refined and adapted to suit the needs of
the regional commissions and shared by all the commissions in order to obtain
accurate results and to facilitate comparisons among those results.

V.10 The Advisory Committee also notes that the presentation of certain items
varies from section to section. For example, resource requirements for conducting
monitoring and evaluation in accordance with General Assembly resolution 58/269
may be shown under executive direction and management, programme support,
individual subprogrammes or a combination of these. Certain resources, such as
contractual services, are managed centrally under programme support in some
commissions and decentralized under specific subprogrammes in others. Not all of
the commissions have presented a list of the publications to be issued by component
for the coming biennium or a summary of the actions undertaken to implement
relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies, or indicated clearly the number
of programme outputs added and discontinued. The Committee requests that
closer attention be paid to a more uniform presentation of the budget proposals
in the future, facilitating meaningful comparisons among the activities and
resources of the regional commissions.

A/60/7

V.11 The Advisory Committee was informed of the negative repercussion of the
freeze on the hiring of General Service staff (see resolution 58/270, para. 25) in
some commissions, such as ESCWA and the Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), which, due to retirement, are losing large
numbers of highly qualified staff in this category who can no longer be replaced.
This in turn leads to greater competition for scarce, well-qualified General Service
staff, some of whom have been offered higher grades and even Professional
positions in other United Nations organizations.

V.12 With regard to vacancy rates, the Advisory Committee notes a significant
improvement in certain commissions. However, the Committee points out that the
vacancy rates may be skewed favourably to some extent as a result of the transfer of
large numbers of General Service staff to the Department of Safety and Security
during the 2004-2005 biennium.

V.13 A summary of the resources requested for monitoring and evaluation in
accordance with General Assembly resolution 58/269, broken down by component,
as well as a brief description of the related activities, is provided in table V.2.

Recommendations on posts

V.14 The reclassification of one Field Service post to P-3 under programme support
(see A/60/6 (Sect. 17), para. 17A.76), relates to the increasing complexity and
responsibilities of the post dealing with communications and videoconferencing



109

A/60/7

technologies and VSAT functions in view of the recent implementation of the ECA
information and communication technology programme. The Advisory Committee
recommends approval of this request.

V.15 A total of 11 Professional posts would be redeployed between components and
subprogrammes. The Advisory Committee notes in particular the redeployment of
three Professional posts (2 P-4, 1 P-2) from programme support to subprogrammes 5
and 7. The Committee welcomes this progress and commends ECA for its
efforts to transfer resources from programme support to substantive activities.
The Committee particularly notes the number of redeployments of Professional
posts between subprogrammes, indicating flexibility in adjusting the level of
resources to workload and programmatic priorities.

V.16 The Advisory Committee welcomes the significant improvement reported
in filling vacancies and notes that details of the measures taken to improve the
incumbency situation are provided (A/60/6 (Sect. 17), table 17A.27), as
requested by the Committee in its previous report (A/58/7, para. V.11). The
Committee notes that the vacancy rate has dropped from 23.4 per cent and 6.6 per
cent at 31 May 2003 to 7.2 per cent and 3 per cent at the end of March 2005 for
Professional posts and General Service posts, respectively. The Committee
commends ECA for its efforts to tackle this problem on a variety of fronts,
including through the direct involvement of ECA management, the systematic
follow-up of vacant posts, the training of staff in the use of the Galaxy
recruitment system and sustained efforts to search for competent staff and
attract them to ECA.

V.17 The Advisory Committee recalls its previous recommendation on the use of
general temporary assistance to fund 83 posts for periods sometimes exceeding 10
years on the basis of 11-month contracts (A/58/7, para. V.15) and notes from the
summary of follow-up action taken (A/60/6 (Sect. 17), table 17A.27) that ECA has
set up a joint staff-management team to review this matter and to make proposals.
The Committee trusts that this matter will be pursued diligently and that strict
controls will be put in place to prevent future misuse of general temporary
assistance funds. The Committee requests that the proposals of the joint staff-
management team and the actions taken in response to these proposals be
reported in the next performance report.

Recommendations on non-post resources

V.18 The Advisory Committee notes that ECA has reconstituted its Publications
Committee to look into the issues raised by the Office of Internal Oversight Services
(see A/58/785, para. 83). The number of publications will be reduced from 106 to
75, of which 57 are non-recurrent publications. The Committee points out that the
list of publications to be issued in the 2006-2007 biennium was not included in the
supplementary information provided to it.

V.19 The Advisory Committee notes that the costs of external printing would
decrease by $49,300 (before recosting), largely through the discontinuation of
publications rather than an increased share of internal printing. The Committee also
notes that ECA has built up its internal printing capability and is now able to
produce all the documents for conferences and meetings in-house. However, ECA
still resorts largely to external printing to meet the demands of the substantive areas,
in particular for its flagship publications. The Committee was informed that during
the 2006-2007 biennium, ECA will continue to strengthen its in-house printing
capabilities for higher-quality printing and will also direct efforts and resources
towards making publications available electronically. The Committee requests that
progress in this regard be reported in the next proposed programme budget of
ECA.

V.20 Requirements for travel of staff, estimated at $1,736,600 (before recosting)
remain unchanged from 2004-2005, but nonetheless, in the view of the Advisory
Committee, remain high. As discussed in paragraph V.5 above, the investments
in ICT and videoconferencing infrastructure should lead to less travel,
especially between ECA and its regional offices and to destinations outside of
Africa (see A/58/7, para V.18). The Committee reiterates its view that, given the



111

A/60/7

high cost of travel in the region, with each trip budgeted at a minimum of
$2,000, efforts to limit travel should be pursued vigorously. The Committee
requests that progress in this regard be reported in the next proposed
programme budget of ECA.

V.21 The Advisory Committee notes that a provision of $942,400 has been made
under subprogramme 8, in accordance with section V of General Assembly
resolution 45/248 A of 21 December 1990 and section XVII of General Assembly
resolution 46/185 C of 20 December 1991, for the continuation of the grant to the
African Institute for Economic Development and Planning (IDEP) to finance four
core Professional posts (1 D-1, 1 P-4 and 2 P-3). Upon enquiry, the Committee was
provided additional information which indicated that the total resource requirements
for the 2004-2005 period amounted to $6,354,361, including $2,939,210 under the
IDEP regular budget and $3,415,151 from extrabudgetary funds. The United
Nations grant of $942,400 was included under the IDEP regular budget resources.
The extrabudgetary funds comprise $1,469,909 from the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa, $1,000,000 from the Netherlands and $945,242 from other
sources.

V.22 With regard to conference services, the Advisory Committee continues to
be concerned that the capacity of the United Nations Office at Nairobi is being
underutilized by ECA and is not convinced that all efforts have been made to
improve cooperation with the United Nations Office at Nairobi in this matter
(see A/60/6 (Sect. 17), table 17A.27). The Committee reiterates its opinion that
there is potential for considerable efficiency and productivity gains, as well as
for cost savings under temporary assistance for meetings for translation,
interpretation, proofreading and editorial services. It requests once again that
ECA explore all opportunities for sharing the spare capacity that may be
available at other duty stations at a given time and that it report on progress in
this area in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.

V.23 The Advisory Committee also questions whether the amount of $82,900
requested under contractual services for promotion, advertising and marketing of the
ECA conference centre is a judicious use of funds, given that the expected income
of the conference centre for 2006-2007 amounts to $374,100, an increase of $33,800
over the current biennium.

V.24 The estimates for extrabudgetary resources at the time of the preparation of the
budget proposals indicate a decrease of approximately $4.6 million, down from
some $27.6 million projected to be raised for the 2004-2005 biennium to
approximately $23 million for the current biennium. Even though the amounts
indicated are still provisional at this stage, the Advisory Committee expresses
concern in this regard. However, the Committee was informed that a wide range of
fund-raising initiatives have been put into place, including a process for dialogue
with funding partners on a quarterly basis. ECA indicated that it was optimistic
about its ability to raise additional funds and to create new partnerships.

V.25 The Advisory Committee welcomes the comprehensive and detailed
information provided in A/60/6 (Sect. 17), table 17A.27, on the follow-up to
actions taken to implement its recommendations and those of the Board of
Auditors.

V.26 The Advisory Committee notes that the resources for the 2006-2007 biennium
for the Regional Commissions New York Office are requested at the level of the
revised 2004-2005 appropriation, $1,585,600 before recosting. Staffing of the Office
remains unchanged, at a total of 6 posts: 1 D-1, 1 P-5, 1 P-4/3, 1 General Service
(Principal level) and 2 General Service (Other level).

V.27 The Advisory Committee reiterates its previous recommendation (A/58/7,
paras. 106 and V.29), which called upon the United Nations funds and

A/60/7

Recommendations on posts

V.29 Three P-5 posts are requested:

(a) One for subprogramme 1, Poverty and development (A/60/6 (Sect. 18),
para. 18.35);

(b) One for subprogramme 4, Trade and investment (ibid., para. 18.50);

(c) One for subprogramme 7, Information, communication and space
technology (ibid., para. 18.65).

The Advisory Committee was informed that the additional three P-5 posts are
requested to strengthen the research and analytical capacities of three ESCAP
regional institutions, on the basis of resolutions 61/3, 61/4 and 61/5 adopted by
ESCAP at its sixty-first session, in the context of the realignment of the work of the
regional institutions with the programmatic priorities of ESCAP. While the
Committee does not dispute the justifications presented for these senior posts,
at the same time it notes that the combined regular and extrabudgetary
requirements for consultants and experts remain at considerable levels,
practically unchanged, at some $7.5 million. The Committee is of the opinion
that the establishment of new posts at senior levels, especially those intended
for research and analytical purposes as is the case here, augment internal
capacity, which in turn should reduce the need for external consultants and
expertise. The Committee recommends acceptance of these three P-5 posts on
the understanding that requirements for consultants will be reassessed with a
view to achieving economies (see para. V.38 below).

V.30 One P-4 is requested for subprogramme 3, Development of Pacific island
countries and territories (A/60/6 (Sect. 18), para. 18.45). From the supplementary
information provided, the Advisory Committee notes that this post is to strengthen
the work of the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre, based in Suva, on strategies for
poverty reduction and improving livelihoods in Pacific island developing countries
within the context of internationally agreed goals and targets. The Committee
recommends the establishment of this post.

V.31 One P-2 is requested for subprogramme 7, Information, communication and
space technology (ibid., para. 18.65). The Advisory Committee observes that this is
offset by the abolition of one Local level post for the biennium 2006-2007. The
Committee notes that this post is to strengthen the work of the subprogramme on the
coordination of the regional outcomes of the World Summit on the Information
Society. The Committee recommends the acceptance of this request.

V.32 The Advisory Committee welcomes the proposed abolition of 14 Local level
posts, in addition to the abolition mentioned in paragraph V.31 above. Of these, four
(1 accounting clerk and 3 registry and document clerks) are directly related to
productivity gains achieved through the automation of processes and investments in
information technology. The functions of the remaining 10 posts will be replaced
through outsourcing arrangements, which are more cost-effective (4 information
technology assistants and 6 building-maintenance technicians). The Committee
encourages further measures to achieve cost-effectiveness and productivity gains.
The Committee also notes that the vacancy rate for General Service staff was
reduced from 8.6 per cent at the end of May 2003 to 0.4 per cent at the end of
March 2005, and commends ESCAP on this achievement. Furthermore, the



114

A/60/7

Committee notes that the ratio of General Service posts to Professional posts would
be reduced from 1.7 to 1.3. The Committee commends ESCAP for this
improvement, which addresses the concerns of the General Assembly on the
high proportion of General Service posts relative to Professional posts in the
regional commissions (see resolution 56/253, para. 72).

V.33 A number of redeployments are proposed at ESCAP as set out in table V.4:

Table V.4
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific: summary of
redeployments under section 18

Grade Outward redeployment from Inward redeployment to

1 P-4 Executive direction and

Subprogramme 5, Transport and

1 P-3 Programme support Executive direction and
management

2 Local level Programme support Executive direction and
management

1 Local level Programme support Subprogramme 3, Development
of Pacific island countries and
territories

V.34 The Advisory Committee notes that the average number days a post remained
vacant at ESCAP was reduced from 357 in 2002-2003 to 334 in 2004-2005, and that
a sharp decrease, with a target of 260 days, has been set for 2006-2007. Even
though this target number is still relatively high when compared with the
vacancy periods at some of the other commissions, such as ECE and ESCWA,
the Committee commends ESCAP for setting itself an ambitious target and
encourages it to pursue its efforts vigorously in this area.

Recommendations on non-post resources

V.35 The Advisory Committee notes that the number of publications has been
reduced considerably, from 176 in 2002-2003 to an estimated 117 in the current
biennium, with a further reduction to 106 to be effected in 2006-2007. The number
of outputs, including discontinued publications, which will no longer be produced in
2006-2007 has also been considerably reduced, by 327 items, of which 50 are
recurrent. The Committee commends ESCAP for its thorough review, carried
out in response to the Committee’s recommendations (A/58/7, para. V.4) and
those of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (see A/58/785), aimed at
clearly linking outputs to specific subprogramme expected accomplishments,
which will ensure that resources are focused on addressing the needs of the
membership of ESCAP.



115

A/60/7

V.36 The Advisory Committee notes that despite the reduction in the number of
publications, the resource requirements for external printing have not been reduced
significantly. The Committee is of the view that in-house printing capability
could be better used. The Committee was informed that many hard-copy
publications are also made available electronically and that these efforts will be
pursued. The Committee requests ESCAP to report on progress in this area in
the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.

V.37 The Advisory Committee notes a sharp increase of $133,400 (26.7 per cent
before recosting) under contractual services, which is due largely to support
contracts for computer-related equipment. The Committee stresses the need to
coordinate closely with Headquarters on all technical matters regarding ICT
infrastructure and support costs to apply institutional standards and to avoid
unnecessary costs (see para. V.5 above).

V.38 The Advisory Committee notes that the resource requirements for consultants
and experts are practically at the same level as for the previous biennium,
amounting to $853,800 (before recosting) under the regular budget, a decrease of
$11,600, or 1.3 per cent. The extrabudgetary provision is $6,741,600, an increase of
$55,800, or 0.8 per cent. Upon enquiry, the Committee was provided a list of
consultancy contracts for the bienniums 2002-2003 and 2004-2005, by
subprogramme, showing the nationality of the consultant, the duration of and
amount paid for the service and the number of times a contract was awarded to the
same consultant. From this additional information provided for the 2004-2005
biennium, the Advisory Committee notes a significant expenditure for consultancy
under programme support ($64,550), higher than the amount spent under any single
subprogramme during the same period. For the 2006-2007 biennium, the
requirement for consultants under programme support is further increased to
$82,000 (before recosting). In the light of its recommendations and observations
in paragraph V.29 above, the Committee recommends that the requirement for
consultants be reduced by $85,000 (approximately 10 per cent) (before
recosting).

V.39 The Advisory Committee notes that the resources for travel of staff have been
budgeted at the maintenance level and amount to $1,299,800 (before recosting). The
relative requirements for travel within the subprogrammes have changed, with
increases proposed for subprogrammes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 and programme support
offset by reduced requirements under policymaking organs and subprogrammes 1, 6
and 7. Upon enquiry, the Committee was provided with information justifying the
additional travel requirements requested by subprogramme, with details on the
additional conferences, meetings and workshops to be attended. While the
Committee does not call into question the usefulness of any particular meeting,
it maintains that travel arrangements and schedules should be reviewed
carefully with a view to limiting travel requirements, and that this would lead
to an overall reduction in travel-related requirements, especially in view of the
investments made in ICT infrastructure for electronic communications and
videoconferencing (see para. V.5 above).

V.40 In particular, the travel requirement requested under executive direction
and management is unchanged at $277,000 (before recosting). The Advisory
Committee is not convinced that all efforts have been made to limit travel and
to use alternative means of communication in this area.



116

A/60/7

V.41 The Advisory Committee commends ESCAP for the significant projected
increase in estimated extrabudgetary resources, an increase of $4,545,500, or 21 per
cent, over the estimate for the current biennium, mostly from bilateral sources. The
Committee notes also that ESCAP continues to receive funding from UNDP and
UNFPA, even though the amounts have decreased steadily since 2002-2003 (see
para. V.3 above). The Committee was informed that funds were raised from a wide
range of bilateral donors, including, for example, the Asian Development Bank, as
well as from a number of Governments.

V.42 The Advisory Committee notes from A/60/6 (Sect. 18), paragraph 18.18, that
resources identified for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation in accordance with
General Assembly resolution 58/269 are requested from both regular budget
($450,200) and extrabudgetary sources ($375,500). The Committee further notes
that the resource requirements have been presented at the subprogramme level. All
the units will undergo training to increase their capacity for self-evaluation. The
Committee commends ESCAP for its efforts to carry out this activity in a
systematic, comprehensive manner. The Committee requests ESCAP to report
on its activities in this area in the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2008-2009.

Other comments and recommendations

V.43 During its visit to ESCAP in June 2004, the Advisory Committee was
impressed by its rapid embracing of the results-based model and the reforms
undertaken to support the process. In 2002, ESCAP had decided to revise its
conference and programme structures and focus its work on three thematic
priorities, namely, poverty reduction, managing globalization and addressing
emerging social issues. The Committee commended the Executive Secretary for the
role he had played in advocating the reform and for the bold initiatives he had
undertaken to restructure the secretariat of the commission by reallocating posts to
reflect the programme priorities as well as to improve performance through the
application of results-based programme and project planning, budgeting,
management, monitoring and evaluation.

V.44 The Advisory Committee also remarked the clear advance of ESCAP in the use
of information-technology applications to support the implementation of the results-
based approach and for effective management. The Committee was particularly
interested in e-TC, an electronic database of technical cooperation projects that
served as a central point where all information about a project was located,
including electronic copies of documents relating to projects. The e-TC database
provided an up-to-date, easy-to-use overview of technical cooperation projects and
was available in all offices throughout the secretariat. It allowed management to
monitor project milestones and budgetary delivery more effectively, but also
provided a “warning bell” which quickly identified delays in project
implementation.

V.45 In Cambodia, the Advisory Committee noted a rural poverty-reduction project
based on a model which consisted of identifying leaders in communities and
training them to formulate poverty-reduction programmes themselves. The concept
was designed to ensure direct input and thereby “customize” the projects to the
specific needs of the community rather than impose a formula that had been
developed by assistance officials — in short, a demand-driven rather than supply-
driven model.



117

A/60/7

V.46 These examples show clearly that the experience of ESCAP could have
provided valuable lessons learned to other entities undergoing similar processes. No
doubt similar, innovative approaches are being applied in other commissions that
could benefit all the regional commissions.

Recommendations on posts

V.47 The Advisory Committee notes that regular-budget staff levels would remain
unchanged and that extrabudgetary posts would be reduced by one P-5. The
Committee notes that new workload requirements for the 2006-2007 biennium
would be addressed through internal redeployments of staff and commends
ECE for a more cost-efficient use of resources and increased flexibility in
responding to changing requirements.

systems officer. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that standard services
such as e-mail and Internet were provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva,
but that ECE had its own team to develop and maintain specialized information
systems.

Recommendations on non-post resources

V.49 The Advisory Committee notes that 313 outputs produced in 2004-2005,
including meetings and publications, would be discontinued in 2006-2007. The
number of publications would be reduced from an estimated 200 in 2004-2005 to
164, including 8 recurrent publications. The Committee was informed that a greater
number of publications are now available in electronic form and that this number
will continue to increase. The number of publications available in hard-copy format
only would be reduced to 72 (44 per cent of the estimated total number of
publications), as compared with an estimated total of 102 for 2004-2005. Given the
highly developed communications infrastructure in the European region, it
appears to the Committee that the electronic dissemination of publications
could be increased rapidly without posing major difficulties.

V.50 Despite a decrease of $22,400 (6.7 per cent) under contractual services due to
reduced requirements for external printing, the Advisory Committee notes from the
additional information provided to it that the total requirement for external printing
under the regular budget still amounts to $159,100 (before recosting). Given the
considerable capacity of the United Nations Office at Geneva publishing facility, the
Committee questions the need for this level of resources for external printing. The
Committee was informed, upon enquiry that recourse to external printing was still
required since certain forms of publications, such as special maps and CD-ROMs in
multiple searchable languages, could not be produced at the United Nations Office
at Geneva. The Committee welcomes the projected increase in internal printing
planned for the 2006-2007 biennium and requests ECE to limit the use of
external printing to exceptional cases. The Committee requests ECE to report
on progress in this area in the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2008-2009.

V.51 Requirements for travel of staff, estimated at $663,700 (before recosting),
show a growth of $30,300, or 4.8 per cent, over the appropriation of $633,400 for
biennium 2004-2005. The Advisory Committee notes that higher amounts are
requested under executive direction and management ($15,800), subprogramme 3,
Statistics ($9,100) and programme support ($5,400). Upon enquiry, the Committee
was provided with additional information on the travel requirements under
executive direction and management, which amount to $218,600 (before recosting).
It was informed that the increase was attributable to the need for additional travel to
Central Asia, where ICT connectivity is not highly developed. Nevertheless, in the
light of the recent investments in ICT and videoconferencing infrastructure and
the improved connectivity of United Nations offices worldwide, the Committee
is of the opinion that resources for travel should be decreasing rather than
increasing. It requests that all efforts be made to limit travel, to combine trips
and to use alternative methods of communication whenever possible. Savings
should be reported in the next performance report.

A/60/7

V.52 The Advisory Committee points out that the information provided in the
summary of follow-up action taken to implement the relevant recommendations of
the oversight bodies on the use of videoconferencing was confusing and incomplete
(see A/60/6 (Sect. 19), table 19.29). From additional information provided to it, the
Committee notes that the number of videoconferences initiated by ECE has been
growing steadily, from 41 in 2003 (total duration of 4,680 minutes) to an estimated
90 in 2005 (total duration of 12,000 minutes), and that these figures do not include
all the videoconferences in which ECE participates. The Committee welcomes this
progress and requests ECE to report on the use of videoconferencing and other
means of electronic communication in the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2008-2009.

V.53 The Advisory Committee notes that a total of $1,025,800, including $6,500
from extrabudgetary funds, is identified for the conduct of monitoring and
evaluation in accordance with General Assembly resolution 58/269, reflected under
executive direction and management and under each subprogramme (ibid., para.
19.17). The Committee was informed that the evaluation would cover programme
outputs, including publications, meetings and workshops, and that efforts would be
made to involve staff and intergovernmental bodies through mechanisms such as
surveys. The findings of the evaluation would be used to adjust the programme and
methods of work and would be reported in programme performance reports. The
Committee commends ECE for its comprehensive response to the request of the
General Assembly. The Committee recalls that in its previous report it had already
expressed its appreciation for the thorough and proactive review undertaken of the
ECE meetings and publications programme (see A/58/7, para. V.54). The
Committee points out that other commissions could benefit from the experience
and expertise of ECE in formulating a common policy and standard
methodology for monitoring and evaluation for all regional commissions. The
Committee reiterates the need to actively exchange best practices, lessons
learned and tools developed among the regional commissions.

V.54 Concerning resources requested for consultants and experts, the Advisory
Committee notes that this expenditure has been budgeted at the level of the 2004-
2005 revised estimates. In certain cases, it appears that funds are simply shifted
from one subprogramme to another; for example, the amount of $36,900 is moved
from executive direction and management to subprogramme 4, Economic analysis,
and $4,500 goes from subprogramme 9, Industrial restructuring and enterprise
development, to subprogramme 8, Human settlements. The Committee considers
this type of “routine” budgeting method inappropriate for this object of
expenditure, the budget for which should be determined on a case-by-case basis
and limited to specific activities for which necessary expertise is not available
in-house. The Advisory Committee requests that special attention be paid to
this matter and that the United Nations regulations on the use of consultants be
applied strictly.

V.55 The estimates presented for extrabudgetary requirements for 2006-2007, at
$13,467,000, indicate a downward trend from the estimates for 2004-2005, which
amount to $16,175,900. From the more recent information provided to it, the
Committee notes that the new estimate for extrabudgetary resources for the 2006-
2007 biennium, as at 16 June 2005, is $14,746,100. The Committee is concerned
that UNDP and UNFPA appear to have withdrawn their funding of ECE. The
Committee urges ECE to vigorously pursue its efforts to raise extrabudgetary



120

A/60/7

funds and to report on the progress and/or difficulties experienced in this area
in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.

V.56 The Advisory Committee notes that the provision of $1,363,900 (before
recosting) for grants and contributions reflects a decrease of $30,000 due to reduced
requirements for services provided by the International Computing Centre.

Recommendations on posts

V.57 Seven new Professional posts are proposed in order to strengthen support and
capacity at the subregional and country levels:

(a) One P-4 for subprogramme 3, Macroeconomic policies and growth
(A/60/6 (Sect. 20), para. 20.48);

(b) One P-2 for subprogramme 3, Macroeconomic policies and growth
(ibid.);

(c) One P-2 for subprogramme 4, Social development and equity (A/60/6
(Sect. 20), para. 20.54);

(d) One P-3 for subprogramme 6, Population and development (ibid., para.
20.64);

(e) One P-2 for subprogramme 6, Population and development (ibid.);

(f) One P-2 for subprogramme 8, Environment and human settlements
(A/60/6 (Sect. 20), para. 20.74);

(g) One P-2 for subprogramme 11, Subregional activities in Mexico and
Central America (ibid., para. 20.90).

V.58 The Advisory Committee notes that the establishment of these seven new
Professional posts is offset by the abolition of 10 local posts, resulting in a net
reduction of three posts. The 10 posts proposed for abolition include one under
subprogramme 2, two under subprogramme 9, one under subprogramme 10 and six
under programme support. The Committee requested but was not provided with



121

A/60/7

further information on the rationale for abolishing these posts. This information
should be provided to the Fifth Committee.

V.59 Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided additional information
on the functions of the requested new posts. In view of the need to strengthen
support and capacity at the subregional level and the need to increase the
institutional and technical capacity of countries in areas which have been
assigned a high priority by the membership of ECLAC, the Committee
recommends the acceptance of these proposals.

V.60 The Advisory Committee recalls that in addition to the requirements
outlined above, two additional posts had been authorized by the General
Assembly for 2004-2005 (see resolution 58/270). At the same time, increased
requirements under consultants and experts are also being requested. In the
opinion of the Committee, the establishment of additional Professional posts
strengthens the in-house capacities of the Commission and should lead to
reduced requirements for consultants.

V.61 The Advisory Committee notes that the overall vacancy rate is 7.3 per cent and
that the vacancy rate for General Service staff is even higher, at 8.7 per cent,
representing 25 posts. The Advisory Committee was informed that of these 25 posts,
18 are vacant due to the retirement of the previous incumbents, who could not be
replaced as a consequence of the freeze on the hiring of General Service staff.

V.62 A considerable number of redeployments are also requested and summarized in
table V.6. The Advisory Committee welcomes the serious efforts that have been
made to reallocate resources to priority areas through redeployment.

Recommendations on non-post resources

V.63 The Advisory Committee notes, following the review of outputs in the context
of each subprogramme, that an estimated 505 outputs produced in 2004-2005 will
be discontinued in 2006-2007. Of these 505 discontinued outputs, 216 are
publications, down from an estimated 362 in 2004-2005. The number of recurrent
publications would be reduced from 196 in 2004-2005 to 98 in 2006-2007. The
Committee welcomes the progress made. It points out, however, that the list of
publications to be issued in the 2006-2007 biennium was not included in the
supplementary information provided to it. However, detailed information was
subsequently supplied upon request.

V.64 The Advisory Committee notes that, in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 58/269, resources requested for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation
amount to $1,444,600 from the regular budget and $231,700 from extrabudgetary
resources. The Committee welcomes the efforts made to incorporate evaluation
plans for all the substantive subprogrammes. The Committee was also informed
that a comprehensive, in-depth review of subprogramme 3, Macroeconomic policies
and growth, will be undertaken, aimed at evaluating the quality of service provided.

V.65 An increase of $57,900, or 5.2 per cent, is proposed under consultants and
experts, bringing the total requirement up to $1,180,300 (before recosting) for the
2006-2007 biennium, from $1,122,400 for 2004-2005. In the opinion of the
Advisory Committee, the level of resources allocated for consultants was
already considerable before the latest increase. The Committee questions the
need for this level of resources and trusts that the strict application of
procedures will result in savings.

V.66 From additional information provided upon request, the Advisory Committee
notes that of the total regular budget resources under this item for the 2004-2005
biennium ($1,122,400), a larger share ($663,300, or 59 per cent) was used for
consultants than for expert groups ($459,100, or 41 per cent). This breakdown is not
available for the extrabudgetary funds, which represent nearly all of the total
expenditure. In the opinion of the Committee, a clear distinction should be made
between resource requests for expert groups and those for consultants, which
are sometimes used to supplement existing staff resources without adequate
justification (see A/58/7, para. 93). While the use of consultants may be justified
in situations where they provide technical expertise, it appears to the
Committee that there is a tendency to request consultancy funds to supplement
existing staff resources. For example, it is not clear why a consultant is required to
evaluate the language-training programme when the United Nations possesses
considerable in-house expertise in this area.

V.67 The Advisory Committee also notes, for example, that despite the
reinforcement of subprogramme 3 with two new posts and four inward deployments,



123

A/60/7

the requirement for consultants is projected to grow by $10,200, or 11.1 per cent. In
the majority of cases, the consultants for the various subprogrammes are requested
to provide inputs for reports and studies and specialized expertise not available at
ECLAC. In the opinion of the Committee, efforts should be made to acquire the
necessary expertise within ECLAC, especially in the core programmatic areas.

V.68 The Advisory Committee notes with satisfaction that the number of
videoconferences increased by 60 per cent, from an average of 22 per month in 2004
to an average of 35 per month in 2005. The Committee was informed that this had
significantly improved coordination with the subregional offices. The Committee
welcomes this progress and notes that the resources requested for travel of staff
have decreased slightly, by $20,300, or 1.3 per cent. The Committee expects that
the increased use of videoconferencing will have a more significant impact on
travel requirements in the coming biennium and requests ECLAC to report on
progress in this area in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-
2009.

V.69 On a related matter, the Committee notes an increase of $155,000 for
communications costs, due in part to the increased use of videoconferencing
resulting in long-distance charges. In this regard, the Committee urges ECLAC
to contain costs through better use of the available ICT infrastructure.

V.70 The Advisory Committee notes that at $19,285,400, the overall level of
extrabudgetary resources for the 2006-2007 biennium is showing a projected
decrease of $2,480,100 at this stage. However, even though the funding from UNDP
and UNFPA has decreased, it has not been withdrawn completely, as is the case in
some other commissions (see para. V.3 above). The Committee urges ECLAC to
vigorously pursue its fund-raising efforts and to report on the progress in this
area in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.

V.71 The Advisory Committee was informed that the ECLAC medical clinic serves
a variety of non-ECLAC personnel. Upon enquiry, the Committee was provided
additional information which indicated that emergency services were provided to
visitors, conference attendees and interns free of charge, and that limited medical
services were provided to staff members of other United Nations agencies and to
Chilean soldiers on peacekeeping missions on a charge-back basis.

A/60/7

Recommendations on posts

V.72 The establishment of four Professional posts is proposed as set out below. The
additional posts would be offset by the abolition of five posts, including three Local
level posts under subprogrammes 1 and 5 and programme support, and two Field
Service posts under programme support. Taking into account the reasons
provided in the proposed programme budget, the Advisory Committee
recommends the acceptance of the following proposals for posts:

(a) One P-1/2 for subprogramme 1, Integrated policies for the management
of regional resources for sustainable development (A/60/6 (Sect. 21), para. 21.27);

(b) One P-3 for subprogramme 3, Economic analysis and forecasting for
regional development (ibid., para. 21.35);

(c) One P-2/1 for subprogramme 3, Economic analysis and forecasting for
regional development (ibid.);

(d) One P-3 for subprogramme 7, Advancement and empowerment of
women (A/60/6 (Sect. 21), para. 21.51).

V.73 The Advisory Committee welcomes the reduction in the number of days
taken to complete the recruitment process, from 190 days during the 2002-2003
period to 114 days in 2004-2005. The Committee notes that this is below the
organizational target of 120 days and commends ESCWA on this achievement.

V.74 A significant change under ESCWA is the introduction of the new
subprogramme 7, Advancement and empowerment of women. The Advisory
Committee notes that this new subprogramme would be staffed essentially through a
series of redeployments and the establishment of one new P-3 post. The Committee
welcomes this example of efficient management and judicious use of resources. A
summary of the redeployments proposed is provided in table V.7.

V.75 The Advisory Committee notes that ESCWA plans to redeploy one P-5 post
from subprogramme 1 to programme support, where there are already five P-5 posts.
The Committee is concerned about resources being shifted from substantive
areas to programme support. The Committee was informed that the administrative
and support services of ESCWA were heavily burdened with additional demands
from other United Nations entities and temporary United Nations missions in
Lebanon. ESCWA provides a variety of services to these missions and entities, such
as movement control, accommodation, travel, communications, IT support,
translation, procurement, payments and medical services. The Committee
recognizes the additional workload these support functions can represent.
Nevertheless, as a matter of principle, the Committee requests that ESCWA
consider alternative options, such as increased cooperation with the host-
country authorities.

Recommendations on non-post resources

V.76 As a result of the review of the programme of work of each subprogramme, the
number of outputs would be reduced by 45 (19 per cent), from 239 in 2004-2005 to
194 in 2006-2007, including 47 publications of which 29 are recurrent. The
Advisory Committee was informed that during 2004-2005, ESCWA increased the
number of electronic publications and that the shift from hard-copy to electronic
format would be carried out gradually and in consultation with the target
beneficiaries in the region. The Committee requests that ESCWA report on progress
in this area in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.

V.77 The Advisory Committee notes that the resources allocated for monitoring and
evaluation, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 58/269, amount to
$476,817 (see A/60/6 (Sect. 21), para. 21.15). The Committee is pleased to note that
ESCWA plans to work with the guidance of the Office of Internal Oversight



126

A/60/7

Services to strengthen its capacity in this area. The Committee welcomes this
approach, based on the utilization of internal capacity where it exists.

V.78 The Advisory Committee notes that extrabudgetary resources are estimated at
$4,271,200, an increase of $554,800 over the estimate of $3,716,400 for 2004-2005.
Funding from United Nations funds and programmes, including UNDP, UNFPA, the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the International
Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Development Fund for Women,
appears to have been withdrawn at this stage, but is offset by a considerable increase
from multilateral and bilateral sources. As indicated in A/60/6 (Sect. 21), paragraph
21.12, due to the particular situation of the region, ESCWA has always found it
difficult to estimate in advance the level of extrabudgetary resources that may be
contributed for its activities in the future. Owing to the uncertainty regarding these
extrabudgetary funds, ESCWA plans to recruit short-term staff to provide support
for individual projects rather than request resources for ongoing temporary posts for
the 2006-2007 biennium. The Committee was informed that ESCWA has launched a
fund-raising campaign, including numerous fund-raising actions such as regular
donor conferences. The Committee welcomes these efforts and requests that
ESCWA report on progress in this area in the proposed programme budget for
the biennium 2008-2009.

V.79 The Advisory Committee notes a considerable increase under grants, from
$93,900 in 2004-2005 to $252,200 (before recosting), an increase of $158,300, or
169 per cent. The Committee was informed that this provision was required for the
funding of the part-time medical services of an external doctor. While the
Committee understands that this service is necessary, arrangements for the
provision and cost-sharing of medical services should be worked out in a
transparent manner, a priori.

Section 22
Regular programme of technical cooperation

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $44,860,000

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $42,871,500

V.80 The Advisory Committee points out that some of the fundamental
questions raised in its previous report (A/58/7, paras. V.89-V.90) on the
procedures for budgeting, performance review, accountability and oversight of
the regular programme of technical cooperation, as well as its recommendation
that the regular programme of technical cooperation and the Development
Account be combined into a single section with distinct parts (ibid., para. V.91),
were addressed in the report of the Secretary-General on the review of the
regular programme of technical cooperation and the Development Account
(A/59/397), which also made proposals for possible improvement. The
comments of the Committee on that review are presented below.

V.81 The Advisory Committee notes that the resource requirements proposed for
2006-2007 are at the same level as those approved for the biennium 2004-2005,
amounting to $42,871,500 (before recosting). These resources are proposed for
2,232 work-months of regional and interregional advisory services.



127

A/60/7

V.82 With regard to the budget fascicle submitted for 2006-2007, rather than
reiterating its observations on the weakness of the presentation of the expected
accomplishments and indicators of achievement and other aspects, some of
which are inherent in the very nature and structure of the programme, the
Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the proposals submitted by the
Secretary-General should be acted upon in order to provide the programme
with a clear mandate and framework for planning, monitoring and reporting
on its activities.

V.83 The Advisory Committee refers the estimates under section 22 to the
General Assembly for appropriate action.

V.84 The report of the Secretary-General on the review of the regular programme of
technical cooperation and the Development Account (A/59/397) was prepared in
accordance with paragraphs 48 and 58 of General Assembly resolution 58/270; in
paragraph 48 of that resolution the Secretary-General was requested to “undertake a
fundamental and comprehensive review of the regular programme of technical
cooperation and to make appropriate proposals to the General Assembly at its fifty-
ninth session”. The Advisory Committee had called for a similar review in
paragraph V.90 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2004-2005.4

V.85 The Advisory Committee commends the Secretary-General for producing
a thorough, objective report, presenting a critical analysis on a broad spectrum
of issues concerning the Development Account and the regular programme of
technical cooperation, their strengths and their weaknesses. With regard to the
regular programme of technical cooperation, the issues covered include an outline of
the legislative history of the programme, a description of its operating modalities, an
exposé of strategic issues to be considered, such as the relevance of the programme
in today’s context, and, finally, proposals for adapting the structure, mandate,
reporting and auditing requirements of the programme, as well as an evaluation of
the impact of the options proposed. The report further briefly examines the
implications of combining the regular programme of technical cooperation and the
Development Account into a single budget section.

V.86 The Advisory Committee recalls that the regular programme of technical
cooperation was initially established by the General Assembly in its resolution
58 (I) of 14 December 1946, which authorized the Secretary-General to include in
the regular budget of the United Nations funds for the provision of technical
assistance requested by developing countries in the area of social welfare
programmes. The programme was subsequently expanded through successive
General Assembly resolutions to include a variety of other sectoral components,
such as public administration and human rights, as well as regional advisory
services. Initially, technical cooperation projects had to be approved by the
Economic and Social Council, but the programming and budgetary procedures were
modified by General Assembly resolution 2514 (XXIV) of 21 November 1969,
which delegated the authority to approve new projects to the Secretary-General.
This authority was further delegated to the implementing offices, thereby allowing
increased flexibility in responding to requests for services. Extensive guidelines and
criteria for the use of technical cooperation funds were developed by the Secretariat
in 1980 and endorsed by the Governing Council of UNDP. The guidelines stipulate,
inter alia, that emphasis must be placed on using regular programme of technical



128

A/60/7

cooperation resources for assisting least developed countries, to fill gaps where
funds from other sources are insufficient, on activities of a limited duration and on
projects of an innovative character, the results of which can be given wider
application and produce a multiplier effect. The full criteria are provided in annex I
of the Secretary-General’s review (A/59/397).

V.87 The Secretary-General’s review identifies serious weaknesses in the
programme, some of which have already been pointed out by the Advisory
Committee. Among the most significant weaknesses exposed are the absence of a
single programme manager for the regular programme of technical cooperation who
is accountable to the General Assembly; the absence of proper mechanisms for
setting priorities, approving projects and allocating resources; and the difficulty in
enforcing the application of uniform procedures across a dozen implementing
entities. Of further concern is the absence of means for assessing the effectiveness
of the programme and evaluating its activities, given that the biennial programme
performance report does not include a separate section for the regular programme of
technical cooperation, even though some of the implementing entities report on
technical cooperation activities in their overall programme performance reports.

V.88 The Advisory Committee recognizes that some of these difficulties are
inherent to the very nature and structure of the programme, which is geared to
responses to requests from Member States that cannot be precisely planned and
which does not report on its activities to the General Assembly. However,
certain anomalies have crept into the functioning of the programme over the
years, in particular in connection with the question of the proper use of
advisers, which constitute the main instrument of the regular programme of
technical cooperation and account for the major part of the resources
consumed by the programme. For example, in some cases, advisers have been
under contract for prolonged periods through recurring short-term contracts,
with their functions and those of staff becoming increasingly blurred; or they
may even be used to fill staff positions for which regular funds do not exist.

V.89 As noted above, the funds available for the regular programme of technical
cooperation are overwhelmingly utilized for advisory services, which take the form
of high-cost international positions located at various duty stations. Upon enquiry,
the Advisory Committee was informed that although the focus on advisers had taken
root over the years, other ways of using the funds are permitted.

V.90 From the additional information provided upon request, the Advisory
Committee notes that the number of advisers has been reduced slightly, from 80 in
1987 to 76 currently. Of these 76 advisers, 11 have been with the regular programme
of technical cooperation for a period of more than 10 years, 13 between 5 and 10
years and the remaining 52 for less than 5 years.

V.91 In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, these issues must be addressed
urgently to bring the focus of the programme back to its original purpose,
taking into account the current context and the changes which have taken place
in the area of technical cooperation and development since its inception. In this
context, careful thought must be given to clarifying the mandate of the programme
and to incorporating it into the debates on relevant programmatic themes. Since the
programme is characterized by small-scale activities, in the view of the
Committee, organs or other intergovernmental bodies such as the Economic
and Social Council, the Second Committee, the Third Committee or the



129

A/60/7

Committee for Programme and Coordination would be the most appropriate
bodies to provide guidance to the programme to allow it to situate itself more
clearly among the variety of technical cooperation mechanisms of the United
Nations system.

Recommendations on posts

VI.1 The proposed programme budget for 2006-2007 contains a number of
proposals for restructuring the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights (OHCHR), based on recommendations of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services in its report on the management review of OHCHR (see
A/57/488).

VI.2 The Office of Internal Oversight Services recommendations were formulated
around the need to develop a strategy for guiding priority choices, for strengthening
the management capacity of OHCHR, for adapting the organizational structure to be
more functional with clear reporting lines and for streamlining and rationalizing the
administrative units and processes. The conclusions of this review were noted by the
General Assembly in its resolution 57/313 and were subsequently referred to by the
Joint Inspection Unit in its report contained in A/59/65-E/2004/48. The Advisory
Committee was informed that the delays in implementing the Office of Internal
Oversight Services recommendations were due largely to the long period of
uncertainty and transition undergone by OHCHR following the mission assignment
to Iraq and subsequent tragic death of the previous High Commissioner in August
2003.

VI.3 The restructuring proposed by OHCHR is in line with the recommendations of
the Office of Internal Oversight Services and includes the following changes:

(a) Creation of a management cluster under the direct supervision of the
Deputy High Commissioner including the Administration and Management Service,
a Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, a Resource Mobilization Unit and a
Public Information Unit. The areas of financial management, general administration,
recruitment and staff administration, logistical and administrative support for field
offices and operations and information technology would be overseen by a manager
at the D-1 level. The Office of the High Commissioner would also be streamlined
and less top-heavy, with the outward redeployment of the Assistant Secretary-



131

A/60/7

General, one P-4 and two General Service staff to the new Office of the Deputy
High Commissioner;

(b) Creation of the Operations, Programmes and Research Division, headed
by a director at D-2 level. The Division would comprise the Research and Right to
Development Branch and the Capacity-Building and Field Operations Branch,
which share common elements, such as field presence and technical cooperation
activities. It is hoped that their grouping under a single director will strengthen
interaction and avoid duplication;

(c) Creation of the Human Rights Procedures Division, which will group the
Special Procedures Branch and the Treaties and Commission Branch under a senior
manager at the D-2 level. All special procedures would be consolidated under a
single branch.

VI.4 In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the restructuring proposed by
OHCHR presents a credible first approach towards resolving the weaknesses
exposed in the review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The creation
of two divisions through the regrouping of substantive branches, each headed
by a senior manager, should provide the necessary strategic direction, coherent
programme implementation and coordination, and improved management of
the large and diverse numbers of staff and units. The creation of a management
cluster under the responsibility of the Deputy High Commissioner utilizes this
Assistant Secretary-General-level post more fully, as recommended by the
Office of Internal Oversight Services, and also addresses the issues of
fragmentation of administrative and information technology functions through
the creation of consolidated units. The Committee further notes that the
creation of a D-1 post in the management cluster will ensure improved
oversight and management in the areas of operations, general administration,
recruitment and staff administration, logistical and administrative support for
field offices, information technology and financial management.

VI.5 The Advisory Committee points out that when compared with that of other
departments, the current senior post structure of OHCHR is lean. At present, 84 per
cent of staff are at or below the P-4 level, 12 per cent at the P-5 level and 4 per cent
at D-1 and above. The Committee welcomes the structure proposed for the offices of
two heads of division, each composed of one D-2 and one General Service support
staff member, and the indication that these offices are dedicated to coordination and
reporting line functions. The Committee trusts that these offices will be
maintained as described above and will not be filled in with additional layers of
staff whose functions duplicate others or would be better performed in
operational units.

VI.6 The Advisory Committee appreciates the efforts of OHCHR and its senior
management to address the structural weaknesses of the programme identified
by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, although a number of
recommendations remain outstanding. It requests OHCHR to address the
remaining recommendations expeditiously, identifying those that have been
overtaken by events. In the view of the Committee, the current proposals
constitute an important first step towards the comprehensive plan of action for
implementing all outstanding recommendations of internal and external
reviews called for in the review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services



132

A/60/7

(see A/57/488, para. 76). The results achieved and lessons learned from this first
phase will facilitate the elaboration of such a comprehensive plan of action.

VI.7 The Advisory Committee is also mindful of the upcoming discussions in
September 2005 on the reforms proposed in the Secretary-General’s report “In
larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”
(A/59/2005) (see chap. I above). However, it considers the current proposals to
be free-standing in that they address structural weaknesses of OHCHR which
need to be remedied as soon as possible, regardless of the outcome of the
September discussions. In the opinion of the Committee, the successful
implementation of these measures will strengthen the management and
administration of OHCHR and better prepare it to undertake such new reforms
as may be agreed upon.

VI.8 Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends the approval of the
following posts:

(a) One D-2 for subprogramme 1, Human rights mainstreaming, right to
development, research and analysis (A/60/6 (Sect. 23), para. 23.45);

(b) One D-2 for subprogramme 2, Supporting human rights bodies and
organs (ibid., para. 23.55);

(c) One D-1 for Programme support (ibid., para. 23.75).

VI.9 One P-4 post under subprogramme 1, Human rights mainstreaming, right to
development, research and analysis (ibid., para. 23.45), is proposed for a human
rights officer in the Research and Right to Development Branch. The Advisory
Committee points out that a new P-4 post was established under this subprogramme
in the biennium 2004-2005 and requests that efforts be made to ensure that there is
no duplication between the functions of these posts. It also draws attention to its
observation on cooperation with UNCTAD in paragraph VI.19 below. Subject to
the foregoing, and on the basis of the information provided, the Committee has
no objection to this proposal.

VI.10 Two P-3 posts under subprogramme 4, Support for human rights thematic
fact-finding procedures (ibid., para. 23.69), are proposed for conversion from
temporary assistance as part of the continued efforts to regularize permanent
functions. The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of these proposals.

VI.11 The Advisory Committee notes that one P-4 would be redeployed from
subprogramme 3, Advisory services, technical cooperation and field activities, to
subprogramme 1, Human rights mainstreaming, right to development, research and
analysis.

VI.12 The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly had approved the
establishment of six posts (1 D-1, 2 P-5, 3 P-4), as well as the conversion of five
temporary posts, including one P-5, one P-4 and one P-3, for the Centre for Human
Rights and Democracy in Central Africa, in Cameroon, and two P-3 posts located in
Geneva for subprogramme 3 for the biennium 2004-2005. The Committee was
informed that of these 11 posts, all except one of those that are located in Geneva
have been filled. However, OHCHR is experiencing difficulties in filling the three
posts of the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa. The
supplementary information provided to the Advisory Committee indicates that the
three converted posts were budgeted in 2004-2005 at 50 per cent of costs. The



133

A/60/7

Committee questions the reasons for a delayed deployment factor for converted
posts.

VI.13 The Advisory Committee notes that vacancy rates had increased from 11.9
per cent (Professional) and 0 per cent (General Service) at the end of May 2003 to
13.3 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, at the end of March 2005. This situation is
also reflected in the performance measures for the average number of post vacancy
days under executive direction and management (see A/60/6 (Sect. 23), table 23.7)
which increased from 180 days in 2002-2003 to 230 in 2004-2005. The Committee
was informed that this was to some extent a consequence of the state of transition
and uncertainty of OHCHR in recent years (see para. VI.2 above), resulting in an
overall lack of clarity, which has had an impact on the planning and decision-
making process. The recruitment process at OHCHR is serviced essentially by the
United Nations Office at Geneva, which itself has limited capacity and has had
difficulties adjusting to Galaxy, and by the United Nations Office for Project
Services (UNOPS), which manages five field offices, including 51 staff. The
Committee urges OHCHR to vigorously pursue its efforts to improve its own
procedures and performance in this area, and to work closely with the United
Nations Office at Geneva and UNOPS on improving the quality of the support
provided. The Committee requests that OHCHR report on the progress made
in the next proposed programme budget.

VI.14 Concerning imbalances in the geographical distribution of OHCHR staff,
which is heavily skewed towards one group of contributing Member States, the
Advisory Committee was informed that OHCHR is committed to correcting this
imbalance and to ensuring that the staff composition reflects the cultural diversity of
the population it serves. The Committee trusts that concrete progress will be
made to achieve geographic balance and requests that OHCHR report on
progress in this area in the next proposed programme budget.

Recommendations on non-post resources

VI.15 Reductions are proposed under a number of objects of expenditure,
including, for example, $1,562,200 (40.6 per cent) under other staff costs, $808,400
(55.3 per cent) under consultants and experts, $597,100 (24.6 per cent) under travel
of staff, $365,900 (27.9 per cent) under general operating expenses, $206,400 (45.8
per cent) under contractual services and $226,100 (37.7 per cent) under furniture
and equipment. The Advisory Committee was informed that these were due to the
streamlining of processes as a result of the implementation of the recommendations
of the oversight bodies and the discontinuation of non-recurrent activities, such as
the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur and the International
Commission of Inquiry for Côte d’Ivoire.

VI.16 The Advisory Committee is concerned about the inappropriate use of the line
of expenditure under consultants and experts to pay for activities related to the
servicing of meetings, such as translation and editing. These should be covered from
contractual services or general temporary assistance. Funds under consultants and
experts should be used only for expertise which is not available within OHCHR.
The Committee points out that it will be the responsibility of the new D-1 in
charge of administrative and financial management in the office of the Deputy
High Commissioner to ensure compliance with United Nations regulations and
rules.



134

A/60/7

VI.17 The Advisory Committee notes that the policy, planning, monitoring and
evaluation functions, previously scattered throughout the Office, have been
consolidated within a single unit reporting directly to the Deputy High
Commissioner, as recommended by the Office of Internal Oversight Services. This
unit has OHCHR-wide responsibility for improving the prioritization of the work of
OHCHR, for translating objectives into work plans and for monitoring and
measuring achievements. Resources identified for the conduct of monitoring and
evaluation under this section, in accordance with General Assembly resolution
58/269, are estimated at $1,462,000 (A/60/6 (Sect. 23), para. 23.7).

VI.18 The Advisory Committee notes that following the review of the programme
of work, a total of 191 outputs produced in 2004-2005 will be discontinued in 2006-
2007, related mainly to non-recurrent activities and non-renewed mandates.

VI.19 The Advisory Committee emphasizes the importance of closer coordination
and cooperation with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs on the rights
of indigenous peoples, with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
against Women and with UNCTAD on the right to development to avoid any
overlaps and duplications.

Presentation and logical framework

VI.20 The presentation of the logical framework follows the standard model used
by other departments. In the view of the Advisory Committee, some of the
performance measures presented are purely statistical and do not adequately support
the attainment of indicators of achievement. This weakness applies to other
programmes also, and is discussed in more depth in chapter I of the present report.

Section 24
Protection of and assistance to refugees

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $67,305,200*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $66,243,900

Projected extrabudgetary resources $2,022,860,000

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

VI.21 The Advisory Committee recalls that since the 2002-2003 biennium, the bulk
of the regular budget resources of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees are provided as a lump-sum grant in place of
established posts, with the exception of the posts of the High Commissioner and
Deputy High Commissioner, which are retained as regular budget posts. This
simplified budgetary arrangement was proposed following consultations between



135

A/60/7

UNHCR and the Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly resolution
52/220, paragraph 82, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to
“monitor the flow of extrabudgetary resources to the Office of the High
Commissioner and, based on his findings, to review the funding of the Office from
the regular budget above the current proposed level”. The new arrangements also
take into account article 20 of the statute of UNHCR, which stipulates that
administrative activities may be financed under the regular budget of the United
Nations and that all other expenditures relating to the activities of UNHCR must be
financed by voluntary contributions. Following the recategorization of UNHCR
posts in line with those of UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA, it was determined that
during 2000-2001, in addition to the High Commissioner and the Deputy High
Commissioner, 218 (87 Professional and 131 General Service) of the 433
management and/or administrative posts (50.8 per cent) were financed from the
regular budget and that the regular budget contribution to non-post administrative
costs was $2,326,300 (8.2 per cent of the total $28,355,400).

VI.22 In the proposed programme budget for 2002-2003 (see A/56/6 (Sect. 23),
paras. 23.18-23.20), the Secretary-General requested that the provision for the grant
be calculated on the basis of requirements for 220 regular budget posts and that the
regular budget contribution towards non-post administrative costs be gradually
increased from the 2000-2001 level to 50.8 per cent, or $14,404,500, of the total
non-post administrative costs. The increase would be determined in the context of
proposals for each biennium, but would not exceed $2.5 million. The posts of the
High Commissioner and the Deputy High Commissioner would, however, continue
to be funded from the regular budget and be shown separately from the grant. It was
further decided that the grant would be subject to adjustment for currency and
inflation, and that the arrangements would be subject to review after three
bienniums, in 2008-2009.

VI.23 At that time, the Advisory Committee was informed that these funding
arrangements through the provision of a grant would simplify the work of UNHCR
by eliminating the need for separate administrative procedures in respect of half of
the management and administration posts, and consequently streamline and simplify
the budgetary process. The General Assembly had also endorsed the need to provide
a breakdown of the grant by object of expenditure (see resolution 56.253, paras.
133-136).

VI.24 From additional information provided upon request, the Advisory Committee
notes that the lump-sum grant has evolved from an initial appropriation of
$45,956,000 in 2002-2003 to projected expenditure of $66,243,900 in 2004-2005.
The amount requested for 2006-2007 is $65,785,300 before recosting (see para.
VI.26 below). The sharp increase in the level of the grant between 2002-2003 and
2004-2005 was due to recostings relating to exchange rate variances, inflation and
evolution of salary standards (which totalled $8.6 million in 2003 and $4.3 million
in 2004), a growth of $2 million in the contribution towards non-post costs and an
additional provision of $5.1 million resulting from resolution 59/276, part XI, on the
strengthened and unified security management system for the United Nations. The
Committee notes that most of the expenditure of UNHCR is incurred in Swiss
francs, which appreciated considerably against the United States dollar during the
2002-2003 and 2004-2005 financial periods, going from 1.575 to the dollar to 1.359
and then to 1.2.



136

A/60/7

VI.25 The Advisory Committee considers the overall presentation of section 24
for 2006-2007 to be lacking in transparency, difficult to follow and not
consistent with the spirit of the original approval of the lump-sum
appropriation. As noted above, the use of the lump-sum grant was intended to
simplify and streamline the budgetary process. In the opinion of the
Committee, given that the regular budget represents only 3 per cent of the
overall budget of UNHCR, this method of budgeting could be well suited to the
highly operational nature of UNCHR activities, providing the necessary
flexibility as well as an incentive to manage resources within the limits of an
overall budget ceiling. However, in order to be effective and credible, the use of
a lump-sum grant must be accompanied by full, transparent reporting on both
the use and proposed use of funds. Although the Committee recognizes that
providing an object-of-expenditure breakdown in the proposed programme
budget would be inconsistent with the lump-sum approach previously approved
by the Assembly, it is of the opinion that there is a need to provide justification
for the amount being proposed; an analysis of the way the amount requested
has been arrived at should be submitted in the supplementary information
provided to the Committee. This would also respond to the General Assembly’s
request in its resolution 56/253 for more transparency. The Committee urges
UNHCR to improve its presentation of its regular budget section for 2008-2009,
focusing on providing additional clarity and transparency.

VI.26 As indicated in paragraph VI.24 above, the overall regular budget lump-sum
grant requested for 2006-2007 amounts to $67,305,200 ($65,785,300 before
recosting). Upon request, the Advisory Committee was informed that the total
(before recosting) includes $60,283,900 for posts, $3,132,400 for non-staff costs
and $2,369,000 under safety and security. The Committee notes that the security-
related costs have come down from $5,803,500 for the 2004-2005 biennium, which
included $2,959,800 for non-recurrent costs.

VI.27 The UNHCR Office in New York is headed by a D-2 and has six Professional
and five General Service posts, representing considerable resources for a liaison
office. The Advisory Committee requests that efforts to identify efficiencies and
cost savings be made. The Committee commented extensively on liaison offices in
paragraph 106 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for 2004-2005.4

On a related matter, even though the Office is funded entirely from extrabudgetary
resources, the Committee notes that $1,200 is allocated from the regular budget to
cover contractual services and general operating expenses charged by United
Nations Headquarters. The Committee questions this allocation, since the Office
is staffed by extrabudgetary personnel.



137

A/60/7

Section 25
Palestine refugees

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $36,973,700*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $34,641,000

Projected extrabudgetary resources $1,571,498,900

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

VI.28 The overall regular budget resources for this section amount to $35,196,800,
before recosting, which reflects a net increase of $555,800 (1.6 per cent) over the
previous biennium. The regular budget portion of the overall resources of the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is
required to cover staff costs of international staff in the service of UNRWA, as
decided by the General Assembly in its resolution 3331 B (XXIX) of 17 December
1974. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly had provided
UNRWA five additional posts for the 2004-2005 biennium (1 D-1, 1 P-5, 1 P-4,
2 P-3).

Recommendations on posts

VI.29 One P-4 evaluation and research officer post (A/60/6 (Sect. 25), para. 25.26)
is related to the need to strengthen the Agency’s capacity for analysis of the impact
of UNRWA services on Palestine refugees and their quality of life, which is also
useful for self-evaluation. On the basis of information provided, the Advisory
Committee recommends approval of this post.

VI.30 One P-4 is proposed for a head of the Camp Development Unit, Operational
and Technical Services Department (ibid.). The head of the Camp Development Unit
will define policy and strategy and a comprehensive approach to all aspects of
infrastructure of camps. The Advisory Committee recommends the approval of
this post.

VI.31 One P-3 post is proposed for a project officer in the Gaza field office (ibid.).
The project officer will plan, design implement and monitor non-emergency
projects. The Advisory Committee recommends the approval of this post.

Other comments and recommendations

VI.32 The Advisory Committee requested and received a clarification on the
response of UNRWA to the recommendation of the Board of Auditors to expand the
terms of reference of the Microfinance and Microenterprise Programme Advisory
Board to include the terms of membership, disclosure of conflicts of interest and



138

A/60/7

remuneration benefits. The Committee will revert to this issue with the Board of
Auditors during its next presentation on UNRWA.

Section 26
Humanitarian assistance

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $26,622,300*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $24,275,300

Projected extrabudgetary resources $218,399,600

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

VI.33 The five additional posts requested for the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs constitute a transfer of existing extrabudgetary posts to the
regular budget with the aim of sustaining the stability of the programme through an
increased share of regular budget funding for core functions. Four of the posts
proposed are intended for desk officers in New York and in Geneva to provide
substantive support to field offices. The Advisory Committee was informed that
during the last two years efforts had been concentrated on establishing dedicated
field support and on improving the efficiency of the Office’s field presence. With
the merger of the Humanitarian Emergency Branch in New York and the Response
Coordination Branch in Geneva into the new Coordination and Response Division,
efforts would now be concentrated on providing direction and guidance to the field
on complex emergency and natural disaster matters. The Committee requests that
in the future major restructuring operations such as these be fully explained in
the budget fascicles themselves.

VI.34 Two P-4 and two P-3 posts are proposed for subprogramme 2, Coordination
of humanitarian action and emergency response (A/60/6 (Sect. 26), para. 26.37).
The Advisory Committee notes that these four posts of desk officers would be
allocated to the newly created Coordination and Response Division to strengthen
support for humanitarian coordination activities. Two posts (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) would
be located in New York and would focus on complex emergencies that require
coordination with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department
of Political Affairs and that relate to Security Council decisions and post-conflict
situations. The other two posts (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) would be located in Geneva and
would be dedicated to coordinating with partners and providing support to the field
in the area of natural disasters. In this regard, the Committee notes that since 1997
the number of field offices worldwide has doubled, from 20 to 40. Recognizing the
need to strengthen the core capacity of the Office for the Coordination of



139

A/60/7

Humanitarian Affairs to respond to the increasing number of emergencies
resulting from conflict and natural disasters, the Committee recommends the
approval of these four posts.

VI.35 One P-4 post is proposed for subprogramme 5, Humanitarian emergency
information and advocacy (ibid., para. 26.54). The Advisory Committee notes that
this post is requested to strengthen the Early Warning and Prevention Unit, which is
responsible for identifying potential complex emergencies. The incumbent of the
post would be responsible for tasks such as developing methodology and indicators
for early warning of disasters and emergencies; collecting information for
contingency planning and preparedness; developing mechanisms for identifying
countries and regions most at risk; and ensuring that early warning analysis leads to
the triggering of early, coordinated inter-agency action. On the basis of
information provided, the Committee recommends the approval of this post.

Recommendations on non-post resources

VI.36 Concerning information technology-related services, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the information management applications of the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, including the ReliefWeb
website, were hosted on servers administered by the International
Telecommunication Union, on the basis of a historical arrangement which provided
and continues to provide high capacity and excellent service on very favourable
terms. The United Nations Office at Geneva provides day-to-day services, such as
e-mail and Internet access, on a charge-back basis.

VI.37 The Advisory Committee was informed that administrative support services
for recruitment were provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva, but that the
capacity of that Office was limited and not well suited for the services required by
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, in particular in emergency
situations and for the hiring of field staff. However, rosters maintained by the Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs were used to expedite Field Service
recruitment.

VI.38 The Advisory Committee is concerned by the questions raised about the
capacity of the United Nations Office at Geneva to provide adequate
administrative services to the Geneva-based organizations, in particular in the
area of staff recruitment (see para. VI.13 above). The Committee requests that
an evaluation be undertaken of the needs of the Geneva-based organizations
and the capacity of the United Nations Office at Geneva to respond in a timely
manner. The evaluation should identify gaps in the services provided.

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $162,322,600

Projected extrabudgetary resources 2006-2007 $5,253,900

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

VII.1 Four new P-4 posts for the Web Services Section (A/60/6 (Sect. 27), para.
27.41) are proposed pursuant to General Assembly decision 57/579 and various
General Assembly resolutions, including resolution 59/276, section IX, paragraph 2,
by which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit proposals to
strengthen the United Nations website within the context of the proposed budget for
the biennium 2006-2007. The Advisory Committee recalls that in the biennium
2004-2005 resources released as a result of the establishment of the regional
information hub in Western Europe (see also paras. VII.12-VII.14 below) were to be
redeployed to priority activities such as the United Nations website and information
centres in developing countries. As noted in the Committee’s report on the proposed
programme budget for 2004-2005, one P-4 and six Local level posts were to be
redeployed from the information centres to the News and Media Division to
strengthen the multilingual capacity of the website (see A/58/7, para. VII.11).

VII.2 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, following the
rationalization of the United Nations information centres, one P-4 and six General
Service posts were redeployed to the Web Services Section of the Department of
Public Information (with administrative effect as from 1 January 2004). With these
posts, the Department took the first steps towards the creation of separate language
units, as mentioned in various General Assembly resolutions (see, for example,
resolution 59/126 B, para. 79). The P-4 post was assigned to head the Arabic
Language Unit, and one of the six General Service posts was allocated to each
language unit. Upon request, the Committee was provided with table VII.1, showing
the current staffing of the Web Services Section.

VII.3 The four P-4 posts requested for the biennium 2006-2007 would be for the
Chiefs of the Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish Language Units. The Advisory
Committee was informed that the new Chiefs of Units would actively participate in
implementing the strategic enhancement of the language sites, ensuring uniformity,
consistency and quality. The Committee was also informed that, with the addition of
these posts, the Department anticipates a 50 to 60 per cent increase in the number of
new and updated pages processed and a 20 to 30 per cent increase in the number of
new stories posted in languages other than English. The Committee recommends
the approval of the four new P-4 posts.

VII.4 A total of five posts are proposed for abolition under part VII, as follows:
(a) three General Service (Other level) posts in the News and Media Division
(subprogramme 2) resulting from the review of working procedures and the
application of information and communication technology, (b) one General Service
(Other level) post as a result of the restructuring of the Dag Hammarskjöld Library
(subprogramme 3) and (c) one General Service (Other level) post under outreach
services (subprogramme 4). The Advisory Committee trusts that the abolition of
the posts in question will not be offset in the future by requests for Professional
staff to perform essentially similar functions.

VII.5 Proposed redeployments between subprogrammes are described in detail in
paragraphs 27.17, 27.47, 27.53 and 27.56 of A/60/6 (Sect. 27). A summary is
provided in table VII.2 of the present report.

VII.6 The Advisory Committee was informed that the suspension of recruitment
for new vacancies in General Service posts in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 58/270 had had negative repercussions for some areas of the
Department’s work. Though the current vacancy rate stands at only about 4 per cent,
the Committee was informed that it was not the rate so much as the nature of the
vacancies that was causing difficulties. The Department has found it impossible, for
example, to recruit Chinese and Arabic website assistants from within the



143

A/60/7

Organization. The Committee was further informed that difficulties in recruiting
General Service staff in the News and Media Division have had a direct impact on
the ability of the Department to issue press releases in a timely manner. The
Committee has commented in detail on the suspension of recruitment of General
Service staff in chapter I above.

Recommendations on non-post resources

VII.7 The estimate for contractual services in section 27 amounts to $16,504,700, a
decrease of $175,100, or 1 per cent, from the appropriation for 2004-2005. The
Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information provided to it that
the estimate for contractual services under subprogramme 2 includes an amount of
$10,060,100 for contractual engineering, including an increase of $45,000 over the
2004-2005 amount. It is indicated in paragraph 27-41 of the budget that the increase
relates to the growth in the number of General Assembly and Security Council
meetings. The Committee notes, however, from the additional information provided
to it upon request that the number of General Assembly and Economic and Social
Council meetings covered by the Department increased from 977 in 2001 to 1,152 in
2004. However, although the number of Security Council meetings covered showed
a sharp increase in 2002, it has remained constant since then, at about 400 in 2003
and in 2004. As the number of Security Council meetings covered appears to be
stabilizing, the Department of Public Information should carefully monitor the
use of these funds.

VII.8 The Advisory Committee was informed that the estimate for contractual
services included some external translation of materials that should ordinarily have
been handled by the Department for General Assembly and Conference
Management. It was reported to the Committee that, because that Department was
so overburdened with parliamentary documentation, some materials from the
Department of Public Information received low-priority treatment when it came to
translation. The Department of Public Information had therefore hired its own
external translators. The Committee was informed that the Department maintains a
roster of external translators and that the Web Services Section has set up a pro bono
translation capacity with the translation training departments of reputable
universities. In addition, internal staff are used whenever possible to translate
materials for publications and the website.

VII.9 The Advisory Committee appreciates the pragmatic approach being
taken by the Department and welcomes the use of such arrangements for the
translation of more informal materials; however, the Committee is of the view
that all formal translation of publications or documents emanating from the
United Nations Secretariat into official languages of the Organization should be
handled centrally by the Department for General Assembly and Conference
Management. If it is perceived that translation is not possible internally within
a reasonable time frame, then there should be recourse to contractual
translation through the Contractual Translation Unit of the Department for
General Assembly and Conference Management. The advantages of central
management of contractual translation include economies of scale relating to
the administrative overhead costs, a favourable bargaining position in contract
negotiations with external translators and, perhaps most importantly,
assurance of quality control.

Presentation

VII.10 As shown in table VII.2, five posts are to be redeployed from subprogramme
3, Library services, to strengthen subprogramme 4, Outreach services. The Advisory
Committee was informed, however, that the two subprogrammes were closely
related (in fact, the Dag Hammarskjöld Library is part of the Outreach Division) and
that a new approach was planned for library services to place greater emphasis on
outreach. This is amplified in A/60/6 (Sect. 27), paragraph 27.3, where it is stated
that the libraries will “aim to take up a new role as a network of knowledge-sharing
communities, moving from collections to connections and from building and
maintaining book and periodical collections to facilitating a knowledge-enabled
environment and the exchange of information among stakeholders”. Upon enquiry,
the Committee was assured that the collection side of library services would not be
abandoned; the emphasis of the subprogramme would merely be shifted. In view of
the interrelationship between Library services and Outreach services, the
Committee is of the opinion that consideration should be given to the possibility
of integrating the two subprogrammes.

VII.11 Another presentation issue that strikes the Advisory Committee is the
peculiar situation whereby subprogramme 3, Library services, is to be implemented
by the Dag Hammarskjöld Library “and other United Nations libraries” (A/60/6
(Sect. 27), para. 27.42), although only the Dag Hammarskjöld Library is placed
organizationally within the Department of Public Information. The Committee notes
that in accordance with paragraph 50 of General Assembly resolution 58/270, the
Office of Internal Oversight Services has issued a report on the review of the
operations and management of United Nations libraries (see A/59/373). By its
decision 59/557, the General Assembly decided to defer consideration of that report
to its sixtieth session. The Committee believes the time has come to consider
taking steps towards rationalizing the administration of the United Nations
libraries.

Regionalization of the United Nations information centres

VII.12 The Advisory Committee held a detailed discussion with representatives of
the Secretary-General concerning the experience gained in the establishment of the
regional United Nations information centre in Western Europe. The Committee was
informed that two years into the establishment of the regional centre, it was still too
early to judge the effectiveness of the undertaking. The Committee was further
informed that the consolidation of the information centres, for a variety of reasons,
had not yielded the expected savings. The reasons given included the unwillingness
of a number of staff of the former information centres to move to Brussels,
necessitating expensive buyouts of their contracts. The Committee would have
appreciated it if the proposed programme budget had contained an analysis of the
expected savings, with an indication of what was actually achieved, even if this was
offset by the problems mentioned above. This information should be provided in the
report referred to in paragraph VII.14 below.

VII.13 The Advisory Committee was informed that plans to consolidate information
centres in other parts of the world had been shelved for the time being because it
was perceived that the regional approach would not yield savings and, in fact, could



145

A/60/7

be more expensive in the developing regions (see A/AC.198/2005/3 and A/60/21,
chap. IV, draft resolution B, paras. 34-45). The Committee was informed that the
emphasis would now be on maximizing synergies among the information centres
rather than physically consolidating them.

VII.14. The Advisory Committee believes that a cost/benefit analysis
should be undertaken. In this connection, the Committee was informed that a study
on the issue of regionalization of the information centres would be prepared for the
Committee on Information by the end of 2005. The Committee was also informed
that it was the intention of the Department to submit a comprehensive report to the
General Assembly reflecting the findings of that study as well as of the three-year
collaborative project between the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the
Department, mentioned in paragraph VII.17 below. The Committee trusts that
these studies will lead to an effective reprioritization of the activities of the
Department.

Budgetary flexibility

VII.15 In the course of the discussions on section 27 of the proposed programme
budget, some frustration was expressed by representatives of the Secretary-General
concerning the rigidities inherent in the existing rules and procedures. The example
was given of a United Nations information centre which had a P-5 post but few
funds with which to work. The Department had therefore hoped to hire a national
information officer and use the savings (the difference between the P-5 and the
Local level salaries) for local outreach activities. It was informed that it was not
possible to hire a Local level staff member on a P-5 post; the only way that this
could be handled procedurally was for the Department to propose the abolition of
the P-5 post and, once that had been approved, to request an additional national
information officer post. In chapter I above, the Committee has recommended that
thought be given to authorizing programme managers, during the implementation of
a particular budget, to flexibly utilize international posts for national officers if they
consider this a more effective means of attaining programme objectives, with
associated savings remaining available to promote programme implementation.

Monitoring and evaluation

VII.16 The Advisory Committee welcomes the “new culture of self-evaluation
and performance management” (A/60/6 (Sect. 27), para. 27.9 (a)), which is
being promoted in the Department of Public Information, as well as the
innovative manner in which the Department is planning to use the resources to
be dedicated to monitoring and evaluation pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 58/269. To begin with, the Office of the Under-Secretary-General
includes an Evaluation and Communications Research Unit, which is responsible for
assisting programme managers with annual programme impact reviews and
providing technical support to staff in assessing media coverage and target audience
needs. It is proposed to strengthen the Unit through the inward redeployment of a
P-5 post from subprogramme 4 in exchange for a P-4 post, with the idea being that
this small unit would serve as a catalyst for monitoring and evaluation activities in
other departmental entities (see also chap. I above).

VII.17 In accordance with action 7 of the report of the Secretary-General entitled
“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change” (A/57/387 and



146

A/60/7

Corr.1) and paragraph 17 of General Assembly resolution 57/300, the Department of
Public Information has embarked, with the assistance of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services, on a three-year project, now in its final year, to establish an
internal mechanism for self-evaluation through the annual programme impact
review. The Advisory Committee was informed that the annual review was aimed at
ensuring the comprehensive evaluation of the Department’s communications
programmes and services and was part of a larger effort to incorporate a culture of
self-evaluation into the Organization’s reform process. The Committee was also
informed that the Department’s internal annual review employed a results-based
framework similar to that of the programme budget, incorporating self-evaluation in
the daily work of programme managers, with a view to institutionalizing a new
departmental culture of improved strategic planning through systematic evaluation.
To support these efforts, a series of training workshops have been held for staff.

VII.18 With the emphasis on self-evaluation, the Department plans to distribute the
resources that have been identified for the purpose ($2,002,000) among the
activities of the Department, rather than concentrating them in any one area. Thus,
an amount of $937,400 has been included under executive direction and
management; $663,900 under subprogramme 1, Strategic communication services;
$329,700 under subprogramme 2, News services; $19,200 under subprogramme 3,
Library services; and $51,800 under subprogramme 4, Outreach services (A/60/6
(Sect. 27), para. 27.11). The Committee would ordinarily favour a more
Department-wide approach. However, it recognizes the reasons why the
Department has chosen to handle evaluation and monitoring in this manner.
The Committee considers this to be a rational approach and looks forward to
information on results achieved. Lessons learned should be shared with other
parts of the Secretariat.

Revitalization of the Publications Board

VII.19 The Advisory Committee notes with interest the recent issuance of the
Secretary-General’s bulletin on the Publications Board (ST/SGB/2005/15), which
has been reconstituted in accordance with action 10 (b) of the report of the
Secretary-General entitled “Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for
further change” (A/57/387 and Corr.1). The Committee was informed that one
significant change that had been undertaken was to bring the representation on the
Board down to the level of senior working managers (i.e., P-5 to D-1), that is to say,
those who exercise direct managerial control over publications. The Committee was
also informed that it was expected that a comprehensive review of publications
would be completed by the end of 2005. The Committee welcomes these
developments since this matter has been pending for more than two years,
leaving publications activities without effective central direction.

VIII.1 The overall objectives of activities implemented under part VIII of the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 are to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness of the Organization in managing resources in three
broad management areas, namely, finances, human resources and support services.
Part VIII of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 covers
section 28, Management and support services, and is divided into seven subsections,
which are dealt with separately below.

VIII.2 The Advisory Committee points out that to a large extent, the authority
of the Secretary-General under the Charter, as the chief administrative officer
of the United Nations, is exercised under his direction and on his behalf by the
Under-Secretary-General for Management. As such, the Department of
Management should proactively encourage the development of good
management practices through the exercise of its central managerial and
administrative responsibilities. The results-based budget should reflect the
concrete measures the department has taken to improve the methodology used
by departments and offices to assess the efficiency of new administrative
processes and the effectiveness of their training and technological projects.

VIII.3 In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls that it had requested
that a more objective method of quantification of return on investment should
be developed; moreover, it had previously recommended that in future budget
submissions, all proposals for information technology projects, both new and
ongoing, should be submitted with clear time frames for their completion and
with projections of efficiency gains (see A/58/7, para. VIII.6); this request and
recommendation of the Committee have not yet been fully implemented.

Recommendations on posts

VIII.4 The establishment of one P-5 post is proposed to enhance the administration
of justice (A/60/6 (Sect. 28A), para. 28A.26). The Advisory Committee notes that
the establishment of a P-5 post is proposed in line with the recommendation of the
Office of Internal Oversight Services (see A/59/408) for a full-time presiding officer
of the Joint Appeals Board. As indicated in paragraph 28A.23, the presiding officer
will help to streamline the work of the Board, improve the effectiveness and the
quality of the process and expedite the handling of cases. The existing capacity of
the secretariat of the Joint Appeals Board and Joint Disciplinary Committee will
also be strengthened with establishment of an additional P-3 post to be funded from
extrabudgetary resources (peacekeeping support account). An additional
extrabudgetary (support account) P-4 post for a legal officer is proposed to
strengthen support for the Panel of Counsel.

VIII.5 The Advisory Committee recommends the establishment of a P-5 post
for a full-time presiding officer of the Joint Appeals Board. With regard to the
extrabudgetary posts funded from the support account (1 P-4 and 1 P-3), the
Committee had earlier recommended that, in view of what is stated in General
Assembly resolution 59/283, the related requirements be met for the time being
through general temporary assistance (see A/59/784, para. 109). This
recommendation was endorsed by the Assembly in its resolution 59/301. The
Committee will revert to this matter when it considers the next proposals for the
support account.

VIII.6 The Advisory Committee notes that in line with the reorganization of the
Office of the Under-Secretary-General, a D-2 post would be redeployed from
subprogramme 1, Management services and administration of justice, to the
immediate office of the Under-Secretary-General. Moreover, one P-5 post would be
redeployed from management services to the area of administration of justice.

VIII.7 The proposed staffing table for management services provides for the
redeployment of one P-5 post to the Office of the High Representative for the Least
Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island
Developing States under section 10 in exchange for a P-4 post from that section



149

A/60/7

under the terms of paragraph 14 of General Assembly resolution 58/270. The
Committee recommends acceptance of those redeployments between sections.

Other comments and recommendations

Restructuring and reorganization

VIII.8 The Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management has been
reorganized in 2005 to focus on strengthening accountability within the Secretariat
and, as a consequence of the reorganization, the existing Management Policy Office,
the Oversight Support Unit and the existing capacity for assisting the Under-
Secretary-General in dealing with the internal system of justice have been
consolidated into a new office: the Office for Oversight and Internal Justice
(paras. 28A.2 and 28A.3). The new office will continue to provide management
services but will also support accountability activities by reporting on the
implementation of recommendations made by oversight bodies (the Office of
Internal Oversight Services, the Joint Inspection Unit and the Board of Auditors)
and will provide analysis of the decisions made by the Administrative Tribunal. The
Secretariat anticipates that those analyses will feed into the work of the high-level
follow-up mechanism (decided on by General Assembly resolution 59/272) and the
newly created Management Performance Board.

VIII.9 The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that to better reflect its
functions, the new office should be called the “Office for Oversight Support and
Internal Justice”, since it would not perform oversight per se, but would
interact with the Office of Internal Oversight Services and other bodies. With
regard to functions concerning the internal system of justice, the Committee
detects some confusion with regard to the actual scope of activities to be carried
out in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General. In this connection, the
Committee recalls paragraph 17 of General Assembly resolution 59/283 in
which the Assembly called for measures that should be taken to eliminate the
appearance of conflict of interest, and towards that end requested the
Secretary-General to proceed with the transfer of responsibility for formulating
decisions on appeals from the Department of Management to the Office of the
Secretary-General. The Committee expects the speedy and full implementation
of that resolution.

VIII.10 In paragraphs VIII.14-VIII.15 of its first report on the proposed
programme budget for 2004-2005,4 the Advisory Committee expressed a
number of concerns with regard to the functional effectiveness of the
Management Policy Office, particularly the need to urgently address the lack of
effective mechanisms to monitor, evaluate and measure results and the impact
of the programmes and activities of the United Nations and to promote
improved management methods. There is a need to urgently address those
deficiencies. Accordingly, while it should be for the Under-Secretary-General
for Management to decide on how best to structure his office, functions
previously assigned to the Management Policy Office, such as the assessment of
administrative and management measures and the development of improved
management tools and techniques, should be retained and clearly defined. The
Committee trusts that the implementation of those functions and
responsibilities will be accompanied by the necessary backing and cooperation
throughout the Organization. In this connection, the Advisory Committee



150

A/60/7

reiterates the need for those functions to be supportive and not duplicative of
those performed by the Office of Internal Oversight Services.

VIII.11 With regard to the proposed redeployment mentioned in paragraph
VIII.6 above, the Advisory Committee expresses concern at the potential for
fragmentation in the office of the Under-Secretary-General with an “immediate
office” headed by a D-2 and a “principal office” headed by a D-1. The
Committee trusts that a coherent working arrangement will be developed and
that the particular requirements of the Under-Secretary-General for
Management, who oversees the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and
Accounts, the Office of Human Resources Management and the Office of
Central Support Services, will not inspire attempts to replicate the structure of
his office in the offices of other Under-Secretaries-General.

VIII.12 The Advisory Committee points out that the General Assembly, by its
resolution 59/283, decided, inter alia, that the Secretary-General should form a
panel of external and independent experts to consider redesigning the system of
administrative justice; the Assembly decided that the panel should start its functions
no later than 1 February 2006 and should submit its findings and recommendations
by the end of July 2006 (ibid., paras. 47 and 50). In paragraph 17 of the same
resolution, the Assembly decided that measures should be taken to eliminate the
appearance of conflict of interest, and towards that end requested the Secretary-
General to proceed with the transfer of the responsibility for formulating decisions
on appeals from the Department of Management to the Office of the Secretary-
General. Moreover, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to it by
the end of its fifty-ninth session proposals to separate the functions of
administrative review, appeals, disciplinary matters and advisory services, through
the redeployment of resources, in order to avoid conflict of interest (ibid., para. 30).
The Committee, therefore, intends to revisit the requirements for
administration of justice in the Secretariat in the light of the reports to be
submitted by the Secretary-General and the panel of external experts in the
context of the implementation of Assembly resolution 59/283.

Presentation

VIII.13 The objectives, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and
performance measures for three components (executive direction and management,
management services and administration of justice) of the logical framework of the
Office of the Under-Secretary-General are shown in tables 28A.5, 28A.10 and
28A.12 of the proposed programme budget. The Advisory Committee notes
improvements in the presentation of the elements of the logical framework
under this budget section. At the same time, the Committee is of the view that
the formulation of indicators of achievement, performance measurement,
outputs and external factors should be further improved.

Recommendations on posts

VIII.14 It is proposed to establish one P-4 post of Programme Budget Officer in the
Programme Planning and Budget Division (A/60/6 (Sect. 28B), para. 28B.18). As
indicated in the budget submission, the P-4 post is requested to deal with the
substantial increase not only in the volume of resources, but also in the composition
and complexity of special political missions and the related budgetary work. The
Secretariat provided statistics in support of the proposal (see table VIII.1). The
Advisory Committee points out that this is a resubmission of a previous proposal for
an additional P-4 post in the Budget Division. The Committee recognizes the
steady increase in the workload related to special political missions, as
supported by the data in table VIII.1 and recommends approval of the
requested P-4 post. The Committee notes that one General Service (Other level)
post is proposed for abolition in the Budget Division. The Committee agrees with
the proposed abolition.

Other comments and recommendations

VIII.15 The Advisory Committee is of the view that the indicator of
achievement in table 28B.8, “percentage of surveyed clients indicating that the
preparatory process has improved from previous bienniums”, and the related
performance measurement for the expected accomplishment, “simplified



152

A/60/7

process for preparing budget proposals”, are not specific enough. The
Committee believes that component 1, programme planning and budgeting, of
the logical framework should include a reduction in the lead time in the budget-
preparation cycle as an expected accomplishment and the number of days
required for the preparation as a performance measurement.

VIII.16 The Advisory Committee trusts that improvements will be made in the
presentation of component 3, financial accounting and reporting, of the logical
framework. The Committee finds that the indicator of achievement, “increased
percentage of clients surveyed who rate services at least ‘good’ or ‘very good’”, is
not objective enough and that the performance target “2 additional improvements”
for the indicator of achievement “improvements in insurance policies”, does not
allow an understanding of what improvements are foreseen.

VIII.17 The Advisory Committee notes from paragraphs 28B.14 (a), 28B.20 (a) (i)
and 28B.25 (a) (i) of the budget fascicle that the outputs to be delivered during the
biennium 2006-2007 under section 28B would include servicing of
intergovernmental/expert bodies, including the Advisory Committee, the Committee
for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly.
The Committee finds this information to be somewhat confusing since those
bodies have secretariats which provide substantive services to them; it should
also be noted that substantive services provided by the secretariat of the
Advisory Committee are budgeted under section 1. The Committee understands
that an attempt was made to reflect in the budget fascicle for the Office of
Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, the meetings of the Advisory
Committee, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth
Committee that may require attendance by the staff of the Office of
Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. The Committee points out in this
connection that a distinction should be made between substantive servicing of
intergovernmental/expert bodies and participation in their meetings. The
Committee trusts that in future the formulation of outputs under this budget
section will be refined to reflect this distinction.

VIII.18 The Secretariat provided, upon request, additional information on efficiency
measures that have been introduced in the Office of Programme Planning, Budget
and Accounts or are foreseen for the biennium 2006-2007. The Advisory Committee
notes from the information provided to it that while some efficiency measures will
bring about measurable and identifiable cost savings, such as the proposed abolition
of one General Service (Other level) post in the Budget Division (i.e., savings of
$128,100), other measures would result in either cost avoidance or improved
services and processes, including the implementation of a payroll data analysis tool,
the introduction of the electronic pay slip provided to staff members through e-mail
and the introduction of electronic payment of tax advances. The Committee
welcomes the efforts to achieve efficiency gains in the Office of Programme
Planning, Budget and Accounts. The Committee is of the view that more
progress should also be made to increase automation in the operations of the
Contributions Section.

Projected extrabudgetary resources $11,311,800

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendation on posts

VIII.19 One P-3 post is proposed to be established in the Administrative Law Unit
(A/60/6 (Sect. 28C), para. 28C.35). This post is requested to strengthen the capacity
of the Unit in processing disciplinary cases and requests for administrative reviews
in line with the recommendations by the Office of Internal Oversight Services in its
report A/59/408. The Advisory Committee was provided with statistics on advice,
administrative reviews, appeals and disciplinary cases in support of the request (see
table VIII.2). The Committee was also informed, upon request, that the status of the
backlog for appeal cases for the period from 2001 to 2005 was as follows: 2001, 53
cases; 2002, 65 cases; 2003, 77 cases; 2004, 41 cases; and 2005 (as at May), 30
cases. According to the Secretariat, the decrease in the backlog in 2004 reflects an
overall reduction in the number of new appeals: 24 in 2004 compared with 50 in
2001. There is no backlog of disciplinary cases, which are reviewed when received
by the Office of Human Resources Management and are thereafter handled under
established procedures. The Committee was also informed that if the P-3 post is
approved, the workload of the Administrative Law Unit remains stable and the level
of general temporary assistance resources available for the Unit is maintained, it is
anticipated that the backlog in appeal cases would be eliminated by the end of the
biennium 2006-2007. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of an
additional P-3 post for the Administrative Law Unit. The Committee agrees
with the proposed abolition of one General Service post in the Division for
Organizational Development.

VIII.20 It is proposed to establish one P-3 post in the Medical Services Division
(A/60/6 (Sect. 28C), para. 28C.41) to assist the Director of the Division with
medico-administrative functions related to the administration of sick leave, medical
clearance and compensation claims. As a consequence, it is proposed to abolish one
General Service (Principal level) post, since the functions that are currently assigned
to the post would be subsumed within the other functions of the new P-3 post. The
Advisory Committee was provided, upon request, with additional information which
clearly indicates the increased workload in medico-administrative functions. The
incumbent of the proposed P-3 post of Administrative Officer would assist the
medical personnel of the Division in performing primarily medico-administrative
functions (preparatory and analysis work) to reduce the time they spend on those
activities; the Committee notes that the Office of Internal Oversight Services, in its
recent internal review of the structure and operation of the Medical Services
Division, indicated a need for increase in capacity. The Committee recommends
the establishment of an additional P-3 post and the abolition of one General
Service (Principal level) post in the Medical Services Division. Although it is
not foreseen that the incumbent will be a medical doctor, the Committee trusts
that in the selection process, due regard will be paid to the need for relevant
medical experience.

Other comments and recommendations

Personnel policies

VIII.21 The Advisory Committee has commented extensively on personnel policies
in chapter I of the present report.

Presentation

VIII.22 The Advisory Committee welcomes the progress made in the
presentation of the logical framework for programmes of activities of the Office
of Human Resources Management for the next biennium. The Committee
points out, however, that indicators of achievement, performance measures and
outputs should be presented in a more transparent and clear manner. For
example, the indicator “timely recruitment and placement of staff” under executive
direction and management should clearly specify that it relates to recruitment and
placement of staff in the Office of Human Resources Management only and does not
provide benchmarks or targets for the Secretariat as a whole. The Committee notes a
wide variation among duty stations in reporting on the performance target for the



155

A/60/7

average number of days a post remains vacant, for example, the Office of Human
Resources Management — 250 days (for the Office itself) and 350 days (for the
Secretariat at Headquarters); the United Nations Office at Geneva — 140 days; the
United Nations Office at Vienna — 110 days (for a Professional post); and the
United Nations Office at Nairobi — 250 days.

VIII.23 Clearly there is no unified approach in reporting on the average
number of days a post remains vacant, nor is there a central system that
calculates the relevant data; this makes comparison across duty stations
difficult. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the indicator
“average number of days a post remains vacant” may include time for classifying
the job, drafting the vacancy announcement, clearing the evaluation criteria with the
central review bodies, advertising the vacancy, reviewing the candidates’
applications, interviewing candidates, clearing the recommended candidates with
the central review bodies, making the selection, awaiting the release of the selected
candidate from his or her current position, travel of the candidate and entry on duty.
The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the Office of Human Resources
Management should more actively pursue its coordination role in matters
relating to recruitment with a view to establishing a common methodology of
accounting for the average number of days a post remains vacant; moreover,
the performance targets for recruitment and placement of staff should more
clearly reflect the benchmarks established by the General Assembly.

VIII.24 The Advisory Committee’s comments on the term “stakeholders” listed
among external factors and on the target of 100 per cent as the performance target
for 2006-2007 for the indicator of achievement “efficient and effective use of
resources” are contained in chapter I. Moreover, the Committee’s observations on
the reference under this budget section to substantive servicing of the Advisory
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for
Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly are
reflected in paragraph VIII.17 above.

VIII.25 As indicated in paragraph 28C.13 of the budget, resources identified for the
conduct of self-monitoring and evaluation, which amount to $674,100, would be the
equivalent of 41 work-months of Professional staff and 10 work-months of General
Service staff. The Advisory Committee points out that no indication is provided
in the budget submission as to what is expected as an outcome of self-
monitoring and evaluation. The Committee trusts that the Secretariat will
improve the presentation of self-monitoring and evaluation activities and
explain the related resource requirements. The Committee is of the view that
the Office of Human Resources Management should set an example as to how
this should be done throughout the Secretariat.

VIII.26 The Advisory Committee notes from table 28C.11, indicator (a) (ii), that 60
per cent of staff would successfully complete their learning goals during the
biennium 2006-2007, as set out in the performance appraisal report. The
Committee is concerned about the high projected rate of failure (40 per cent)
and it trusts that this matter will be thoroughly reviewed.

Efficiency gains

VIII.27 The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts to achieve efficiency
gains in the Office of Human Resources Management. Efficiency measures that



156

A/60/7

have been introduced in the Office of Human Resources Management or are
foreseen for the biennium 2006-2007 are expected to bring about efficiency gains
totalling $1,355,400 as a result of the abolition of one General Service (Other level)
post in the Division for Organizational Development and in cost avoidance or
improved services and processes resulting from the streamlining and automation of
the national competitive examination process, the implementation of the web-based
performance appraisal system and the development of online and other information
technology applications in the Organizational Development Services and the
Medical Services.

Human resources monitoring

VIII.28 The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 28C.23 of the budget that
the human resources monitoring activities of the Office of Human Resources
Management will include on-site monitoring of departments, offices and
peacekeeping operations and online monitoring of human resources action plans;
special attention will be given to building improved monitoring (including self-
monitoring) capacity, which would provide for five posts and travel resources
amounting to a total of $196,400 (both regular budget and extrabudgetary) for on-
site monitoring missions. The Committee sought clarification as to the nature of
those activities vis-à-vis the self-monitoring and evaluation referred to in paragraph
28C.13 of the budget. As indicated in the clarification provided, upon request, in
paragraph 28C.13, the term “self-monitoring” refers to the internal monitoring of
the Office of Human Resources Management, while paragraph 28C.23 outlines the
focus of the Office on increasing the capacity of its client departments, offices and
peacekeeping missions to monitor their own operations. The Committee expects
that the results of the on-site monitoring missions of the Office of Human
Resources Management in enhancing the self-monitoring capacity of
departments, offices and peacekeeping missions will be reflected in the budget
submission for the biennium 2008-2009.

VIII.29 With regard to on-site monitoring missions, the Advisory Committee was
informed that since 2002, 17 such missions (covering over 25 offices and field
operations worldwide) had been formally conducted across the Secretariat. In 2005,
it is planned that the Office of Human Resources Management will undertake two
monitoring missions to the United Nations Office at Vienna and UNODC (Vienna)
and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Geneva); in New York,
the Office intends to monitor the Office of Legal Affairs. The Committee was
further informed that in the biennium 2006-2007, the Office planned to conduct
monitoring missions to Geneva (the United Nations Office at Geneva and OHCHR)
and to Addis Ababa (ECA); moreover, during the financial period 1 July 2005 to
30 June 2006, it planned to undertake on-site monitoring missions to six
peacekeeping operations (the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP), the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia, the United Nations
Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL), the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire and the United Nations
Mission in Liberia), utilizing resources of the support account for peacekeeping
operations. According to the Secretariat, the benefits and effects of on-site
monitoring missions include: training of staff in personnel sections of field offices;
enhancement in the processing of education grant claims; provision of consolidated
reference tools and services; sensitization on areas of responsibility within the



157

A/60/7

existing delegation of authority; sensitization on the United Nations code of conduct
and gender issues; exposure of the staff of the Office of Human Resources
Management to the needs of field operations, which increases their responsiveness
and ability to service client needs; and reinforcement of the role of the Office of
Human Resources Management as the central authority and source of guidance in
human resources management.

VIII.30 The Advisory Committee points out in this connection that the benefits
of on-site monitoring missions must be demonstrated through an analysis of
their specific and concrete impact on human resources management in terms of
a reduction in the time required for processing personnel actions or
improvements in personnel administration. Moreover, the Committee questions
the need to send on-site monitoring missions to well-established offices or long-
running peacekeeping operations with good communication links, such as the
United Nations Office at Geneva, the United Nations Office at Vienna, ECA,
UNFICYP and UNIFIL. The Secretariat indicated, upon enquiry, that all 17 on-site
monitoring missions conducted so far had been initiated by the Office of Human
Resources Management.

VIII.31 The Advisory Committee requests that the practice of dispatching on-
site monitoring missions be limited to newly established missions or offices
experiencing personnel management problems that cannot be resolved without
the on-site presence of staff of the Office of Human Resources Management.

VIII.32 The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 28C.25 of the budget that in
the area of information management, the Office of Human Resources Management
intends to focus on enhancing the implementation of a global human resources
information system, including IMIS and Galaxy, and on further enhancing the
Galaxy system for collecting and processing data on staff members and applicants in
the process of filling vacancies. The Committee requested additional information on
the global human resources information system, but it was not provided. The
Committee requests that this information be included in the next report of the
Secretary-General on human resources policy.

Training

VIII.33 Total training resources for the biennium 2006-2007, which amount to
$25.6 million, would provide for the following: leadership development and
performance management — $5.9 million; substantive and technical skills and
career support — $4.8 million; information technology — $3.1 million; human and
financial resources management — $2.3 million; language training — $7.4 million;
and safety, security and other training — $2.1 million. Of the total training
resources of $25.6 million, a provision of $16.1 million is made for centrally
managed staff development and training programmes, reflecting an increase of
$250,000 proposed for senior management leadership programmes. Table 28C.11
and paragraph 28C.34 (c) (ii) of the budget contain information on the projected
number of participants in staff development and training programmes and the type
of training foreseen for the biennium 2006-2007. The Advisory Committee
questions the rationale for training to build basic skills and competencies for
staff in such areas as communication, teamwork, client orientation and work
management, since, in the view of the Committee, the lack of those essential
skills should normally be established during the screening of candidates to fill



158

A/60/7

vacancies, thus obviating the need for such basic training. The Committee also
observes that in a number of cases the description of training programmes does
not sufficiently outline the benefits (other than general enlightenment of staff)
that the Organization would accrue as a result of its investment in training.

VIII.34 The Advisory Committee has written extensively about training in recent
years and its comments, observations and recommendations on training are still
valid. The Committee stresses that the lack of an effective means to evaluate
training remains a very significant drawback of the training activities of the
Organization. The Committee reiterates its view that until a comprehensive
system of evaluation of training is completed and put in place, it will be
impossible to know whether or not training programmes are effective and
whether they improve implementation of programmes, thus justifying their cost
and the staff time devoted to administering, travelling to and attending them;
the lack of a viable system to track competency gaps renders the development
of an effective training strategy difficult (see A/59/736, paras. 76-77).

VIII.35 The Advisory Committee enquired about the status of the draft code of
conduct and was informed that the issue was being actively discussed by the Office
of Legal Affairs and the Office of Human Resources Management. The Committee
trusts that the document will be finalized expeditiously.

Recommendations on posts

VIII.36 It was recommended to reclassify two Trades and Crafts posts to the
General Service (Other level) category to adequately reflect their functions in the
Facilities and Commercial Services Division (para. 28D.21). The Advisory
Committee was informed that the reclassification would result in savings of
approximately $10,200 per year during the biennium 2006-2007. The Committee
recommends the proposed reclassification. A proposal is made for the abolition of
nine General Service and one Trades and Crafts posts. The Committee
recommends the proposed abolition.

A/60/7

Other comments and recommendations

Presentation

VIII.37 The Advisory Committee welcomes the progress made in the
presentation of the logical framework for programmes of activities of the Office
of Central Support Services for the next biennium. More efforts, however,
should be made so that indicators of achievement and performance measures
are presented in a transparent, objective and clear manner; projects should
contain time frames for their implementation. During the hearings, the
representatives of the Secretary-General agreed with the Committee that client
surveys that are shown as indicators of achievement in several areas of central
support services are not objective. Moreover, a number of performance measures for
indicators of achievement are vague (e.g., the number of applications) and too
technical (e.g., the number of hits on iSeek or the United Nations website) and may
sometimes be a factor outside the control and efforts of the Office of Central
Support Services. The Committee is of the view that the indicator of achievement
for the Official Document System (ODS) should also include reference to the time
frame for the availability of United Nations documents on the system. The
Committee trusts that the presentation of indicators of achievement will be
refined to reflect its related comments (see also chapter I of the present report).

VIII.38 The Advisory Committee’s comments and observations on external factors,
including the use of the term “stakeholders” and on 100 per cent as the performance
target for the indicator of achievement “efficient and effective utilization of
resources”, are contained in chapter I of the present report.

Transfer of resources to section 33, Safety and security

VIII.39 The revised appropriation for the biennium 2004-2005 under budget section
28D has been adjusted for a non-recurrent provision of security-related resources
incorporated in the Department of Safety and Security. As indicated in the
additional information provided to the Advisory Committee upon request, following
the establishment of the Department of Safety and Security, the resources of the
Headquarters Security and Safety Services of the Office of Central Support Services
were transferred in its entirety to the new department as of 1 January 2005. From the
perspective of the programme budget proposals for 2006-2007, this redeployment of
resources is shown as a component of the current revised appropriation of the
Department of Safety and Security, with a corresponding reduction in the revised
appropriation of the Office of Central Support Services. The redeployed resources
include:

The redeployed staff resources include 1 D-1, 1 P-5, 3 P-4, 1 P-3, 2 P-2, 1 General
Service (Principal level), 17 General Service (Other level) and 300 Security and
Safety Officer posts.

Efficiency gains

VIII.40 The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts to achieve efficiency
gains in Office of Central Support Services. Efficiency measures reflected in
section 28D of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 are
expected to bring about efficiency gains estimated at a total of $10,465,700 owing
to the abolition of nine General Service (Other level) and one Trades and Crafts
posts, cost avoidance and improved productivity, services and processes resulting
from the transfer to the Information Technology Services Division of responsibility
for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations Data Centre, the transfer of United
Nations Headquarters satellite operations to the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, the consolidation of local area network (LAN) services and operations,
the introduction of new applications developed by the Information Technology
Services Division and of the bar-coding and automated weighing system, as well as
improved mail operations.

VIII.41 The Advisory Committee was also informed during its hearings of a number
of efficiency improvement projects of the Office of Central Support Services,
including the introduction of electronic time management for outsourced cleaning
contractors, linking the telephone directory to a space management module that
allows an accurate determination of staff movement and space availability for every
office in the Headquarters complex and successfully completing negotiations for
global discounts from airlines. While welcoming those measures, the Advisory
Committee points out that more should be done to:

(a) Expand functions that could be more efficiently performed by
contractors;

(b) Improve space management through close coordination of space
requirements with funds and programmes;

(c) Improve global contracts with airlines so that other duty stations
could make more use of discounted rates;



161

A/60/7

(d) Facilitate and expand the access of permanent missions at
Headquarters and other main duty stations to information systems in use by
the Organization, including the Internet, Intranet and ODS.

VIII.42 The Advisory Committee notes that a significant amount of cost avoidance
will be achieved as a result of the reorganization of information technology
functions between the Information Technology Services Division and the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the consolidation of information
technology services and operations and the application of common practices and
standards. The Committee welcomes the efforts made by the Secretariat to
strengthen the governance and standardization mechanisms for information
and communication technology. However, it notes with concern that a
substantial degree of decentralization remains in information and
communication technology. Offices and departments still maintain independent
information technology units leading to unnecessary duplication of functions and
waste of resources. It is recalled that in the context of its review of the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005,4 the Committee pointed out that a
lack of effective governance and leadership was the cause of the apparently
piecemeal systems and databases developed in the Secretariat as a whole, including
those for peacekeeping activities (A/58/7, para. 123). The Committee is concerned
that not much progress has been achieved in terms of improved governance of
information and communication technology systems since its review of the
proposed budget for 2004-2005; there continue to be a number of systems and
databases, such as IMIS, the Budget Information System, IMDIS, Galaxy and
Mercury, that are not compatible with each other or that require complicated
systems of bridges to keep them interconnected. The Committee’s previous
recommendation that financial and programme performance systems be integrated
has not been implemented. A number of United Nations agencies, funds and
programmes spend significant resources on developing their own payroll
functionalities when IMIS has been doing this successfully for over a decade.

VIII.43 The Advisory Committee also reiterates and cautions that the
information and communication technology strategy should not be driven by
extraneous factors, such as, new and emerging technologies offered by the
information and communication technology market, but rather by the internal
needs of the Organization. In this connection, the Committee points out that it
is not satisfied with the one-size-fits-all approach used in estimating the
requirements related to desktop computers and printers; the criteria of
replacing desktop computers every four years does not fully take into account
that in some areas of the Secretariat they are used predominantly as text-
processing tools and thus may not need to be replaced every four years;
moreover, full advantage should be taken of networking possibilities and
investments by the Organization in related technologies that could lead to a
reduction in the number of desktop printers.

VIII.44 In this connection, the Advisory Committee was informed that while an
alternative to IMIS was not likely to be imminently available, the system was fast
approaching its technological lifespan. The Committee was also informed that the
Secretariat was closely following the development of the Enterprise Resource
Planning systems in the United Nations funds, programmes and specialized
agencies, in terms of both functionality and technology; moreover, a study was
funded from the budget for the biennium 2004-2005 for which an independent



162

A/60/7

consulting firm was hired to objectively assess all aspects of IMIS operations and
recommend the most effective course of action. The Committee expects that
Member States will be informed of the financial implications and all other
aspects of IMIS replacement in a timely manner.

VIII.45 A provision of $35,000 under contractual services is made for a pilot project
of Enterprise Content Management in the Information Technology Services
Division. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that Enterprise
Content Management was an integrated set of solutions comprising eight core
modules:

• Web content management

• Document management

• Document imaging and scanning

• Collaboration

• Search

• Web portal

• Digital asset management

• Record management

Together the eight core modules would unite teams, content and associated business
processes within a single web-based platform. The Enterprise Content Management
system would enable United Nations staff to collaboratively create, manage, deliver
and archive information that drives business operations; it would also enable the
United Nations to distribute all information in multiple languages, across internal
and external applications and user communities throughout the world. The
Committee was further informed that, within the Secretariat, there were over 40
applications using approximately 10 different platforms to manage content; many of
the applications were developed in-house, were not integrated and did not “talk to
each other”, and some were reaching the end of their technological lifespan,
including ODS, the Mail Action Records System and the CarLog system. Enterprise
Content Management would allow a coordinated and integrated approach to
information management in the Secretariat.

VIII.46 The Advisory Committee recalls that a request for funding amounting to
$1,023,100 was made for the Enterprise Content Management project under the
support account for the financial period from 2 July 2005 to 30 June 2006. The
General Assembly, in paragraph 16 of its resolution 59/301, decided not to provide
funds for Enterprise Content Management, with the exception of the resources of
$149,000 sought for the Archives and Records Management Section. The
Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that it was the understanding of the
Secretariat that there was no objection in principle to the Enterprise Content
Management project and that the main objection of Member States to the proposal
was that an enterprise initiative of this nature should more appropriately be
presented in the regular budget. The Secretariat estimates the cost of Enterprise
Content Management from $500 to $1,000 per user as a start-up cost (including
hardware, software, training, customization and implementation) and a recurrent
maintenance cost of $60 to $110 per user per year; globally, for the Secretariat,



163

A/60/7

depending on the core modules implemented, the number of users could range
around 1,500.

VIII.47 The Advisory Committee strongly believes that the Organization would
benefit greatly by having in place a more centralized approach to managing
information and communication technology initiatives and operations. The
Committee requests that the Secretary-General review all available options for
improving information and communication technology governance, including
the possibility of a single structure to lead and manage information and
communication technology activities and operations for the Secretariat. The
Committee also reiterates its view that, given the magnitude of resources the
Organization spends on information and communication technology, it would
appear justified to create a new senior position of Chief Information Officer of
the United Nations, who would be responsible for developing information and
communication technology strategy, its most effective structure and its
operational policies and procedures. The incumbent should possess a high
degree of technical experience and expertise along with proven managerial and
leadership ability (A/58/7, see para. 126).

VIII.48 During its review of the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007, the
Advisory Committee enquired as to the nature of the provisions budgeted under
each section for offices at Headquarters under: (a) contractual services related to
centrally managed information technology infrastructure; and (b) maintenance and
servicing related to centrally managed information technology infrastructure.
According to the clarification provided to the Committee, the computing resources
of the United Nations have evolved considerably over the past six years, and there is
a complex and diverse combination of network infrastructure, LAN and application
servers, personal desktop computers and application software. Many departments
have also developed and deployed applications that require extensive installation
and maintenance of servers and related storage and backup facilities. Some
departments continue to rely on mainframe computer applications that require the
connection of user desktops to the mainframe of the International Computing Centre
in Geneva and its services for job management, printing and administration of the
centralized environment. The Office of Central Support Services has been providing
structured, centralized management of diverse infrastructure-type services and
ensuring management of resources to allow individual departments greater
flexibility in managing some of the services.

VIII.49 In order to provide the necessary centralized storage and back-up services to
all departments, the Office of Central Support Services has implemented several
projects during the past five years, including storage area networks and network
attached storage. Connecting those additional applications and servers to the United
Nations network has resulted in a larger burden on the central infrastructure and
higher maintenance costs. The increase in resources required for maintaining those
infrastructures during the biennium 2006-2007 is estimated at $8.3 million for all
Headquarters-based activities. Of the estimated increase of $8.3 million, $4.3
million would be distributed, on a cost-shared basis, among the users of information
technology resources at Headquarters, based on their level of use and requirements
for storage, connectivity, server and backup requirements and mainframe utilization,
and the balance of $4 million would be centrally provided from section 28D, Office
of Central Support Services ($1 million), and section 32, Construction, alteration,
improvement and major maintenance ($3 million).

VIII.50 Table 28D.12 of the budget contains a summary of follow-up action taken to
implement the relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies. The Advisory
Committee observes in this connection that the Administration is not always clear
and straightforward in its responses and sometimes outlines what it intends to do
rather than reporting on what has been achieved. The Committee trusts that
greater effort will be made by the Administration to respond to the
recommendations of the oversight bodies in a timely, clear and straightforward
manner, even when reporting difficulties.

Section 28E
Administration, Geneva

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $104,592,600*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $102,258,100

Projected extrabudgetary resources $25,101,800

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the Introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are
at revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

Recommendations on posts

VIII.51 It was proposed to reclassify the post of Deputy Secretary of the Joint
Appeals Board and the Joint Disciplinary Committee from P-2 to P-3 (A/60/6 (Sect.
28E), para. 28E.15) to strengthen the capacity of the Division of Administration in
servicing the administration of justice with respect to all Geneva-based secretariat
units. As indicated in paragraph 28E.12 of the proposed budget, the activities of the
secretariat of the Board and the Committee will be directed towards eliminating the
backlog in appeals and disciplinary cases and reducing average case-processing
time. The Advisory Committee notes that this proposal is made pursuant to the
recommendation of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In line with its
previously stated position (see A/58/7, para. 77), the Committee recommends
approval of the proposed upgrade.

VIII.52 The reclassification of the post of Chief, Information and Communication
Technology Service, from P-5 to D-1 was proposed (A/60/6 (Sect. 28E), para.
28E.32). This is a resubmission of a previous request. The Advisory Committee
recalls that it had considered a request for the reclassification of this post in the
context of its review of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-
2005 and, on the basis of the information provided during the hearings, it did not
recommend approval of the proposed reclassification. The Committee also recalls
that it had recommended a thorough review of the staff and non-staff resources
devoted to information and communication technology throughout the United
Nations (see A/58/7, para. VIII.53). No information has been provided to the



165

A/60/7

Committee as to the outcome of the review. The Committee points out that the
Information and Communication Technology Service provides mainly basic
maintenance services in the area of information technology and communications.
The Committee further notes that those services have recently decreased because of
the transfer of payroll functions from the United Nations Office at Geneva to
UNHCR. Moreover, conference services in Geneva and UNHCR have their own
dedicated information technology units, while the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs uses the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for its
needs in information technology services. The Committee reiterates its previous
position and does not recommend the reclassification.

VIII.53 The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that a reduction in
General Service (Other level) posts funded from extrabudgetary resources from 90
in 2004-2005 to 72 in 2006-2007 is due mainly to the fact that UNHCR has
undertaken its own payroll function (see para. VIII.60 below). The Committee was
also informed that the transfer of responsibility for the Joint Medical Service from
the World Health Organization (WHO) to the United Nations Office at Geneva
would result in a reduction of $145,200 in the United Nations share of costs of the
Joint Medical Service administered by the United Nations Office at Geneva during
the biennium 2006-2007.

Recommendations on non-post resources

VIII.54 For the biennium 2006-2007, provisions for travel of staff are requested in
the amount of $91,700 (before recosting) under the regular budget, an increase of
$5,300 (6.1 per cent) compared with the revised appropriation for 2004-2005. As
indicated in paragraph 28E.15 of the budget, the increase of $5,300 relates to travel
of the Director of the Division of Administration to Headquarters for consultations
on policy matters. The Advisory Committee believes that in view of the
availability and increased use of electronic communications, in particular
videoconferences, the proposed travel estimates for 2006-2007 should not
exceed the level of the revised 2004-2005 appropriations, that is, $86,400
(before recosting).

Other comments and recommendations

Presentation

VIII.55 The Advisory Committee points out that most of its comments and
observations on the presentation aspect of section 28E, Administration, Geneva,
are also applicable to section 28F, Administration, Vienna, and section 28G,
Administration, Nairobi. Therefore the Committee will not repeat them in those
sections. The Committee expects, however, that the future presentation of the
logical framework under sections 28F and 28G will reflect the comments and
observations it makes in respect of section 28E. The Committee welcomes the
progress made in the presentation of the logical framework for activities to be
implemented by the administrations of the United Nations Office at Geneva, the
United Nations Office at Vienna and the United Nations Office at Nairobi
during the biennium 2006-2007. The Committee is of the view, however, that
further refinements should be made to present indicators of achievement and
performance measures in a more transparent, objective and clear manner;
projects that are planned in support services should contain time frames for



166

A/60/7

their implementation. The Committee is also of the view that client surveys
shown as indicators of achievement in several areas of support services should
be replaced with objective and meaningful performance measures. For example,
performance targets for some indicators of achievement that are expressed in
number of courses per staff member or in average days required to process staff
benefits, while quantifiable, do not appear to convey meaningful information since
they provide data that are too general and aggregate to account for important details
such as the duration of each training course or the time required to process each type
of staff benefit. The Committee is of the view that workload benchmarks should
be increasingly used as performance measures or targets in support services
(see also chapter I of the present report).

VIII.56 The Advisory Committee notes that pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 58/269, the budget fascicle identifies resources estimated at $154,000
(regular budget) and $20,800 (extrabudgetary) for monitoring and evaluation.
Information is provided in paragraph 28E.8 on how those resources are divided
among the three subprogrammes implemented under section 28E. The Committee
was informed during the hearings that IMDIS was used as a tool in self-monitoring
and evaluation.

Efficiency gains

VIII.57 The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts of the Administration of
the United Nations Office at Geneva to achieve efficiency gains. The Secretariat
provided, upon request, additional information on efficiency measures that have
been introduced in the United Nations Office at Geneva or are foreseen; they are
expected to result in cost avoidance estimated at a total of $2,137,800 for the
biennium 2006-2007. Those measures include the implementation of the automated
Consolidated Treasury System, the use of more efficient heat-saving measures in the
conference rooms, the replacement of lighting fixtures and obsolete flushing
installations and other savings anticipated in costs of utilities.

Common services

VIII.58 The Division of Administration provides administrative and other support
services to 22 entities of the United Nations common system. Many such services
are provided to the United Nations funds and programmes, specialized agencies and
other organizations on a reimbursable basis. As indicated in paragraph 28E.4 of the
budget, the proposals for the biennium 2006-2007 under this budget section
underline the growing role of the Division of Administration to lead and foster
common services initiatives among common system entities in Geneva in line with
General Assembly resolution 56/279, in which the Assembly encouraged the
organizations concerned, in their continuing efforts further to expand areas of
cooperative arrangements, to give priority to those services that lend themselves to
common delivery using the criteria of efficiency, productivity and cost-effectiveness
and, where feasible, to take into account the recommendations made by the Joint
Inspection Unit in its report (A/55/856). The Geneva-based organizations of the
United Nations common system were further encouraged to pursue, with a more
structured approach, the improvement of existing common services and the
development of new common approaches within the framework of the Management
Ownership Committee and the Task Force on Common Services and its working
groups.



167

A/60/7

VIII.59 The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that for the biennium
2004-2005 common services contracts cover the following areas:

• Airline negotiations (ongoing project) — the United Nations Office at Geneva,
WHO, the World Trade Organization, the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO), UNICEF, UNHCR, ILO, ITU, the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) and ITC

• Electricity (ongoing project) — cost avoidance of 10 per cent for 2002 and
11.35 per cent for 2003 and 2004; the contract terms were extended for 2005

• Master and volume purchasing agreements

• Office supplies — the United Nations Office at Geneva, ITU, WMO, the
World Trade Organization, the International Organization for Migration
(IOM), ITC and ILO

• Vehicles for field missions — UNHCR, WHO and UNOPS

• Diplomatic pouch services — the United Nations Office at Geneva is the
service provider to all United Nations entities

• Mail services — the United Nations Office at Geneva, ITU, the International
Bureau of Education, UNHCR, IOM, the World Trade Organization, ILO,
WHO and ITC

• Copier services — the United Nations Office at Geneva, UNHCR, UNICEF
and ITC

• Travel agency services — ITC, WMO, UNHCR, WHO, the United Nations
Office at Geneva, WIPO and the World Trade Organization

• Printing services — ITC (the United Nations Office at Geneva, UNHCR and
WMO are reviewing the contracts)

• Translation services — ITC (the United Nations Office at Geneva and WMO
are reviewing the contracts)

• Storage area and network equipment — the United Nations Office at Geneva is
the service provider of wireless network support for conferences; ITU is taking
advantage of the services; other offices, such as OHCHR, will also be serviced
as a result of the contract

• Supply and installation of anti-shatter film — the United Nations Office at
Geneva has signed a contract of which UNHCR took advantage; ITC has also
expressed interest

• Insurance — UNHCR, UNICEF and the United Nations Office at Geneva

• Paper for copiers and printers — the United Nations Office at Geneva, ILO,
ITC, ITU, UNHCR, WMO, WHO and WIPO

• Toners for printers — ILO, ITU, WIPO, WTO, UNHCR, WMO, the United
Nations Office at Geneva and the International Bureau of Education

• Voice telecommunication — the United Nations Office at Geneva and ITC



168

A/60/7

Common services projects for 2006-2007:

• Personal computers/printers — the United Nations Office at Geneva

• Medical supplies — WHO

• Vehicles for field missions — lead Agency to be determined

• Servers — the United Nations Office at Geneva and UNHCR

• Security projects — the United Nations Office at Geneva

VIII.60 The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts of the Division of
Administration to expand common services. At the same time, the Committee
notes that UNHCR has undertaken to administer its own payroll, which was
previously provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva. The Committee
was also informed that the capacity of the United Nations Office at Geneva to
provide administrative services for recruitment was limited and not well suited
for the services required by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs, in particular in emergency situations and for the hiring of field staff.
The Committee is concerned about the lack of capacity of the United Nations
Office at Geneva to provide adequate administrative services to the Geneva-
based organizations. The Committee requests that there be an evaluation of the
needs of the Geneva-based organizations and the capacity of the United Nations
Office at Geneva to respond in a timely manner. The evaluation should identify
gaps in the services provided. In line with its previous recommendation that
progress reports on common services at the United Nations Office at Geneva
should be submitted in the context of the proposed programme budget, the
Committee requests that information on the evaluation also be included in the
next budget submission for the Administration, United Nations Office at
Geneva.

A/60/7

Recommendations on posts

VIII.61 It is proposed to establish one P-3 post for the Secretary of the Joint
Appeals Board/Joint Disciplinary Committee (A/60/6 (Sect. 28F), para. 28F.14).
The Advisory Committee notes that the proposal is made in response to the
recommendation of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (see A/59/408).
Closely related to this matter is a request for a provision of $72,700 under general
temporary assistance to cover the cost of part-time technical assistance for the
secretariat of the Joint Appeals Board/Joint Disciplinary Committee (28F.17). As
indicated in paragraph 28F.14 of the proposed budget, secretarial support and
services have so far been provided to the Joint Appeals Board/Joint Disciplinary
Committee on a part-time basis by staff of the Human Resources Management
Service, and it is proposed now that a separate identifiable secretariat of the Board
and the Committee be established. The Committee recommends the establishment
of a P-3 post for the Secretary of the Joint Appeals Board/Joint Disciplinary
Committee.

VIII.62 The reclassification of one General Service (Other level) post to the P-2
level is proposed to provide for an Associate Programme Budget Officer (ibid., para.
28F.21). The Advisory Committee points out that this is a resubmission of a
proposal made in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 for
the reclassification of two General Service posts (1 to the P-2 level and another to
the Principal level). The Committee was provided with data that clearly indicate that
the workload in the Budget Unit has substantially increased. For example, during
the period 2002-2005, the volume of administered regular budget resources
increased by 64 per cent and the number of allotment accounts increased by 17 per
cent; in extrabudgetary activities, allotment processing for trust funds has increased
from 66 per year in 2002 to 235 allotments in 2004. The Committee was also
informed of the increased workload of the Budget Unit in managing extrabudgetary
resources. For example, effective 1 August 2004, responsibility for the Trust Fund
for the United Nations Space Applications programmes was delegated to the United
Nations Office at Vienna. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the
requested reclassification.

Other comments and recommendations

VIII.63 The Advisory Committee notes that pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 58/269, the budget fascicle identifies resources estimated at $64,700
(regular budget) and $231,200 (extrabudgetary) for monitoring and evaluation. As
indicated in paragraph 28F.10 of the budget, periodic reviews and analysis of the
performance data, client surveys conducted at regular intervals within the existing
capacity and real-time feedback mechanisms on specific services provide a basis for
the internal evaluation. The Division for Management also relies on the evaluation
capacity of the Independent Evaluation Unit of UNDOC.

VIII.64 The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts of the Administration at
the United Nations Office at Vienna to achieve efficiency gains. Efficiency
measures that have been introduced in the United Nations Office at Vienna or are
foreseen for the biennium 2006-2007 are expected to result in cost avoidance
estimated at a total of $87,000. The efficiency measures include: improved
workflow process for agency services requests to UNDP officers (financial
authorization) using Lotus Notes applications; improved management support



170

A/60/7

resulting from a shared Lotus Notes application for project performance monitoring
assisted by automated workflow; improved financial control and management
support through a Lotus Notes application for reporting of field office expenditures
through management ledger and standardized payment request; use of the scanning
feature of photocopiers and electronic dispatch of attachments resulting in reduction
in photocopies; the use of freight rather than express services; and the use of the
two-track approach, namely, splitting the provision of goods and services between
two vendors for regular office supplies and toners respectively.

VIII.65 The Advisory Committee notes that the efficiency measures of the United
Nations Office at Vienna are not expected to produce tangible results as substantial
as those anticipated in the United Nations Office at Geneva or the United Nations
Office at Nairobi. The Committee understands that one of the reasons why the
United Nations Office at Vienna is lagging behind the United Nations Offices at
Geneva and Nairobi is that a significant reorganization has been going on in the
United Nations Office at Vienna and UNODC for some time, including: (a) the
merger of the Information Support Unit of UNODC with the Information
Technology Service of the Division for Management of the United Nations Office at
Vienna; (b) the merger of the Management Advisory Unit of UNODC into the
Human Resources Management Service of the United Nations Office at Vienna; and
(c) the merger of the Financial Support Section of UNODC and the Finance and
Budget Section of the United Nations Office at Vienna into the Financial Resources
Management Service of the latter. Moreover, the Administration of the United
Nations Office at Vienna is experiencing some logistical and technical difficulties
resulting from the implementation of the asbestos removal project (begun in April
2005), which necessitated the relocation of staff to temporary quarters that are less
conducive to the efficient performance of tasks by staff. The Committee trusts that
improved results of the United Nations Office at Vienna in efficiency gains and
an improved working environment will be realized once the reorganization and
the asbestos removal project are completed.

A/60/7

Recommendations on posts

VIII.66 The Advisory Committee notes that in response to the request of the
General Assembly in its resolution 52/220 to bring the financial arrangements of the
United Nations Office at Nairobi into line with those of similar United Nations
administrative offices, the Secretary-General has made a commitment to gradually
increase the regular budget component of the United Nations Office at Nairobi with
a view to easing the administrative costs levied on the substantive programmes of
UNEP and UN-Habitat. The Assembly, in its resolution 57/292, welcomed the
intention of the Secretary-General and urged him to increase the regular budget
component of the United Nations Office at Nairobi in future bienniums so as to
ensure that it would be able to fully execute programmes and activities within its
mandate.

VIII.67 The further strengthening of the regular budget component of the United
Nations Office at Nairobi is reflected in the budget proposal under section 28G for
the biennium 2006-2007, which includes a request for the establishment of 13 new
posts under the regular budget to provide for administrative services that otherwise
would have to be financed on a reimbursable basis from the extrabudgetary
resources of UNEP and UN-Habitat (see para. 28G.3 of the budget fascicle). The
breakdown of those 13 posts is as follows:

• One P-4 under executive direction and management

• Seven Professional and higher category posts (1 D-1, 3 P-4 and 3 P-3) under
subprogramme 2, Programme planning, budget and accounts

• One P-4 post under subprogramme 3, Human resources management

• Four Professional posts (1 P-5 and 3 P-4) under subprogramme 4, Support
Services

The Advisory Committee has no technical reason for objecting to any of the
transfers; it will be for the General Assembly to decide whether all should be
effected in 2006-2007.

Other comments and recommendations

VIII.68 The Advisory Committee notes that pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 58/269, the budget fascicle identifies resources estimated at $36,000
(regular budget) and $5,000 (extrabudgetary) for the conduct of monitoring and
evaluation. As indicated in paragraph 28G.7 of the fascicle, the regular budget
funding would provide for five work-months at the Professional level and four
work-months at the local level, and extrabudgetary resources would cover three
work-months at the local level.

Efficiency gains

VIII.69 The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts of the Administration of
the United Nations Office at Nairobi to achieve efficiency gains. Efficiency
measures that have been introduced in the United Nations Office at Nairobi or are
foreseen for the biennium 2006-2007 are expected to result in cost avoidance
estimated at a total of $296,800 for the biennium 2006-2007. The Committee was
informed that out of a number of the efficiency measures of the United Nations
Office at Nairobi, the use of IMIS functionalities in payroll processing and vacancy



172

A/60/7

announcements would result in identifiable cost avoidance amounting to $296,800,
an equivalent of five Local level staff for 24 work-months. The Committee was also
informed during the hearings that as a result of efficiency measures undertaken by
the United Nations Office at Nairobi, four or five General Service posts could be
made available for redeployment to priority areas within the Office during the
biennium 2006-2007. The Committee welcomes this information.

VIII.70 The Advisory Committee also discussed with the administration of the
United Nations Office at Nairobi the prospects of employing National Professional
Officers and the enhanced recruitment of local staff to fill vacancies in the
international General Service category. The Committee was informed of procedural
and other aspects hindering employment of National Professional Officers. The
Committee is of the view that the Office of Human Resources Management
should play a leading role in resolving this issue so that employment of National
Professional Officers could be expanded and more local staff could fill vacant
General Service international posts available at the United Nations Office at
Nairobi.

Administration of justice

VIII.71 As indicated in paragraph 28G.14, the function of administration of justice
at the United Nations Office at Nairobi would be assigned to two posts in the
secretariat of the Joint Appeals Board/Joint Disciplinary Committee. Moreover,
additional requirements of $106,900 are requested under general temporary
assistance (equivalent to 12 work-months of a post at the P-2/1 level). This would
strengthen the capacity of the secretariat of the Board and the Committee in
managing the appeals process.

Possibility of operating guided tours, bookstores and gift shops at the United Nations
Office at Nairobi

VIII.72 In his report (A/59/793), the Secretary-General discusses the possibility of
operating guided tours, bookstores and gift shops at the United Nations Office at
Nairobi. The Advisory Committee notes that, following the anticipated completion
in 2006 of the off-site building for commercial operations of the United Nations
Office at Nairobi, the United Nations gift shop and other similar operations will be
relocated to that building and resume their activities.

VIII.73 The Secretary-General concludes that the operation of guided tours at the
United Nations Office at Nairobi would result in financial losses for the
Organization. Accordingly, he does not recommend the establishment of a guided
tours operation there. The Advisory Committee concurs with the conclusion
contained in the report of the Secretary-General.

that there would be a substantial revision for the proposal of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services, which would be submitted during the sixtieth session of the
General Assembly.

IX.2 The Advisory Committee stands ready to take up the revised proposals
late in 2005. The Committee trusts that the revised budget proposal will include
details with regard to the strategic action plan of the Office, aimed at
strengthening its role as an objective, client-oriented service provider to United
Nations entities.

Jointly financed administrative activities and
special expenses

Section 30
Jointly financed administrative activities

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General (full budget) $32,272,800*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $29,907,400

United Nations share for 2006-2007 $11,392,200*

United Nations share for 2004-2005 $10,445,200

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

X.1 Resources are requested under this section for three bodies of the United
Nations that are financed on an inter-agency basis:

(a) The International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) and its secretariat;

(b) The Joint Inspection Unit and its secretariat;

(c) The secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for
Coordination (CEB).

X.2 Previously, this section also covered the requirements for the United Nations
share of the costs of inter-organizational security measures, which are now
presented under part XII, section 33.

X.3 Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided additional information
on the cost-sharing formulas applied to determine the share of each participating
agency for the three bodies financed on an inter-agency basis, which is summarized
in annex IV to the present report. The Committee was informed that all cost-sharing
arrangements and methodologies, including those for salary survey activities and
field-based security costs, were being reviewed by the Finance and Budget Network
of the High Level Committee on Management. The Committee requests that it be
kept informed of new developments in this regard. In the view of the
Committee, it is extremely important that an equitable arrangement, accepted
by all, be reached, since this could also clarify and facilitate discussions on cost-
sharing issues in connection with common security costs.



175

A/60/7

International Civil Service Commission

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $15,923,600*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $15,017,800

United Nations share for 2006-2007 $6,003,200*

United Nations share for 2004-2005 $5,637,600

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

X.4 The increase of $24,100 (0.4 per cent) of the United Nations share of the costs
of ICSC reflects the effect of a delay in the application of the revised cost-sharing
percentage to the full amount of the gross budget after recosting in 2004-2005. From
the additional information provided to it, the Committee notes that the cost-sharing
percentage for the United Nations is set at 37.7 per cent of the full budget of the
Commission for 2006-2007 and that this percentage varies between 37 and 38 per
cent, for example, 37.5 per cent in 2002-2003 and 38.1 per cent in 2004-2005.

X.5 The overall resources requested for 2006-2007 are unchanged (before
recosting) from the level of the revised appropriation for 2004-2005, with a
considerable redeployment of resources in the amount of $893,000 from general
operating expenses to consultants and experts. The increased resource requirements
under consultants and experts reflect the expansion of the scope of the study on new
approaches to performance pay and broadbanding. The Advisory Committee was
informed that little or no internal expertise existed, since those types of approaches
have essentially been applied in the private sector. The application of this type of
approach to the United Nations posed a number of challenges, including the need
for in-depth knowledge of both private and public sector environments. It was thus
necessary to obtain highly specialized outside expertise in this matter. The
Committee recommends that ICSC staff be fully involved through all the
phases of the project, working closely with experts and consultants, in order to
build up internal capacity and expertise in this area.

X.6 The Advisory Committee was informed that the resources requested under
consultants and experts, which amount to $1,490,900 (before recosting), were also
intended for studies and surveys related to cost-of-living conditions, including the
collection of pricing data for goods and services and housing costs in the context of
post adjustment surveys at Headquarters and in field offices. The price indices,
which are established for over 170 countries, measure the cost of living of United
Nations international staff stationed at specific duty stations relative to New York
and take into account the consumption pattern of United Nations personnel rather
than that of the local population. Since it is not always possible to use price indices
established by national Governments or statistical organizations, ICSC must collect
pricing data itself. Accordingly, ICSC uses independent price agents who are
experienced and qualified to reflect local shopping conditions. In the opinion of the
Committee, those costs should be charged under contractual services rather
than consultants and experts. It requests that ICSC look into this matter and
report on its conclusions in the next budget proposals for 2008-2009.

X.7 Concerning requirements for travel of staff, which represent a
considerable amount ($453,900 before recosting), the Advisory Committee
requests that efforts be made to reduce those costs wherever possible through
the use of videoconferencing and other electronic means of communication and
prudent management of travel funds. The Committee understands that the
meetings of the technical working groups are usually held away from New York or
Geneva, although the preponderance of the membership is located in those two
cities. The Committee requests that consideration be given to holding working
group meetings in locations where they are most cost effective.

Joint Inspection Unit

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $11,367,700*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $10,574,900

United Nations share for 2006-2007 $3,592,200*

United Nations share for 2004-2005 $3,260,200

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

X.8 The overall resources requested for the Joint Inspection Unit for 2006-2007
(before recosting) are unchanged from the revised appropriation for 2004-2005. The
growth of $81,500 of the United Nations share of the Unit’s resource requirements
compared to biennium 2004-2005 is due to the delay in the application of the
revised cost-sharing percentage, established at 31.6 per cent, to the full amount of
the gross budget after recosting in 2004-2005.

X.9 The Advisory Committee was informed that the Joint Inspection Unit had
refined and improved its monitoring and evaluation tracking system for following
up on the implementation of the Unit’s recommendations and that all but 2 of the 23
participating organizations were already signatories to the system. The new version
was simpler to use, had a shorter reporting period and had received a positive
feedback from users. The system had been introduced three years ago, but the initial
version had been considered burdensome and time-consuming to update. The
Committee welcomes those improvements and looks forward to receiving
information on the status and impact of the implementation of the
recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit on a regular basis as part of the
logical framework.

X.10 The Advisory Committee was provided with additional information on
implementation and results achieved by the implementing organizations for the
period 2002-2003, which showed that out of the 19 reports issued, replies had been
received for 12, and that of those, 10, or 53 per cent, had been positively considered
by the governing bodies of the participating organizations.

X.11 Although the Joint Inspection Unit had committed to a greater use of
videoconferencing facilities (see A/58/7, para. X.9), the Advisory Committee notes
that the requirements requested for travel are unchanged, which nevertheless, at



177

A/60/7

$513,300 (before recosting), represent a considerable amount. In the opinion of the
Committee, travel requirements could have been reduced through increased use
of videoconferencing and electronic means of communication, which would
appear to be particularly well suited to some of the activities of the Unit, such
as data collection and research. The Committee reiterates its request that,
whenever possible, the Joint Inspection Unit use alternative methods of
communication rather than travel; savings achieved should be reported in the
next budget proposals.

X.12 An increase of $2,800 (18.4 per cent) is requested under consultants and
experts, bringing the total requirement under this object of expenditure up to
$18,000 (before recosting). The Advisory Committee recalls that in its previous
report it had requested that the use of consultants to provide additional expertise be
linked more closely to specific items on the basis of the work programme (A/58/7,
para. X.8). The Committee points out once again that, in accordance with the
statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, inspectors are appointed on the basis of
their special expertise in administrative, financial and management matters,
and that recourse to consultants and experts should be limited to exceptional
cases. Upon request, the Committee was informed that between 2003 and 2005, four
short-term consultancies (20-30 days) had been contracted on specific United
Nations common system issues regarding post structure, related appointments and
payroll, and on technical issues concerning medical health insurance. In the
opinion of the Committee, this type of specialized knowledge should be
accessible without recourse to consultants.

X.13 The Advisory Committee had pointed out in its previous report (ibid., para.
X.10) that very little information on the average cost of preparing a report of the
Joint Inspection Unit had been provided. Upon request, the Committee was provided
with additional information on the reports produced in 2004, which indicated that
the Unit had issued 10 reports, 1 note and 1 confidential letter in 2004, and that
most of the reports covered system-wide issues. A summary table of the reports
produced by the Joint Inspection Unit during the 2003-2005 period was also
provided, indicating that 16 reports concerning single organizations (8 each for the
United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies), 3 reports
concerning several organizations and 13 system-wide reports had been produced.

X.14 In the summary of follow-up action taken to implement relevant
recommendations of the oversight bodies (A/60/6 (Sect. 30), table 30.15), the Joint
Inspection Unit indicates that it has adopted a new methodology for the selection of
topics to be included in the Unit’s programme of work. The Advisory Committee
trusts that the use of this methodology will provide additional information on
the costs of the preparation and benefits derived from the recommendations of
the Joint Inspection Unit reports, and requests that those results be presented
in its budget proposals for 2008-2009.

United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $4,981,500*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $4,314,700

United Nations share for 2006-2007 $1,796,800

United Nations share for 2004-2005 $1,547,400

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

X.15 The secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for
Coordination (CEB) is co-located in Geneva and New York, with its headquarters in
New York. Each office has a staffing component of seven posts, including four
Professional and three General Service posts. The activities of the office in Geneva
are focused on issues related to financial, budgetary and human resources issues,
whereas in New York emphasis is placed on the coordination of programmatic and
information and communication technology policy matters.

X.16 Regular budget resources requested for 2006-2007 for the secretariat of CEB
amount to $4,683,500 (before recosting), reflecting a growth of $368,800 or 8.5 per
cent. The share of the United Nations would increase by $141,900, or 9.2 per cent,
to $1,689,300, before recosting. The Advisory Committee notes that this increase
reflects the combined effect of the delayed impact of four new posts approved for
the biennium 2004-2005 and a delay in the application of the revised cost-sharing
percentage to the full amount of the budget of the CEB secretariat after the re-
apportionment in 2004-2005.

X.17 The additional requirements, before recosting, under consultants and experts
($7,800, or 13.4 per cent), travel of staff ($27,500, or 11.9 per cent) and general
operating expenses ($9,600, or 6.5 per cent) are offset by a reduction of $44,900
(12.3 per cent) under contractual services. The Advisory Committee notes that the
consolidation of the inter-agency secretariat into CEB has not led to reduced
requirements for travel. It was informed that the Secretariat had been tasked with
the development of networks and that negotiations among large numbers of experts
were required to reach agreement on their terms of reference. The Committee was
informed that even though videoconferencing was increasingly used as a substitute
for travel, it was not always feasible when the discussions involved multiple
interlocutors in different locations.

X.18 The Advisory Committee notes that the Executive Office of the Department of
Economic and Social Affairs continues to provide some administrative support to
CEB in matters of finance and personnel and that the Assistant Secretary-General
for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs acts as Secretary of the Board.

X.19 The Advisory Committee welcomes the report of CEB entitled “One United
Nations — catalyst for progress and change: how the Millennium Declaration is
changing the way the system works”, which constitutes the contribution of the
Board to the preparations for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General
Assembly, to be held in September 2005, and provides an account of how United



179

A/60/7

Nations organizations are working together to assist Governments to meet the
objectives of the Millennium Declaration. In the view of the Committee, the new
sense of unity of purpose and spirit of cooperation and collaboration highlighted in
the report are essential for making progress towards the achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals, as well as for the most cost-effective use of
resources. It encourages CEB to take further initiatives to ensure greater policy
coherence and coordination throughout the United Nations system.

Section 31
Special expenses

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General (full budget) $95,553,800*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $81,255,900

Projected extrabudgetary resources $17,955,600

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

X.20 Resources are requested under this section for after-service health insurance,
compensatory payments, general insurance charges, bank charges and pension
payments to former Secretaries-General. The overall resource growth amounts to
$6,298,500, or 7.8 per cent (before recosting), and is essentially due to higher
requirements for after-service health insurance ($9,050,900, or 13.3 per cent). This
increase is offset by reductions in: compensatory payments ($64,800, or 3.8 per
cent); general insurance ($2,660,100, or 27.2 per cent), due to insurance premiums
renegotiated at more favourable rates; and bank charges ($150,000, or 27.3 per
cent), due to expected savings owing to United Nations participation in the Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication system. The Advisory
Committee notes that the bank charges presented under this section are subject to
recosting. They are limited to charges incurred under the regular budget and do not
include those for the peacekeeping operations.

X.21 The Advisory Committee was informed that in response to the
recommendation contained in paragraph 47 of the report of the Board of Auditors,12

the Secretariat had undertaken the first steps towards estimating accrued and future
liabilities of the after-service health insurance programme and was exploring
different funding options, which will be presented to the General Assembly at its
sixtieth session. The Committee welcomes progress in this area, which, in
addition to providing valuable information to Member States on the liabilities
already incurred and those that will be incurred based on commitments already
made, is also required for compliance with international accounting standards.
The Committee stands ready to take up the report on after-service health insurance
late in 2005.

Part XI
Capital expenditures

Section 32
Construction, alteration, improvement and major maintenance

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $72,194,800*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $104,566,600

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present text, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

XI.1 Resources for capital expenditure are requested centrally under this section in
order to ensure a coordinated and systemic approach to facilities management,
major maintenance and construction. The Committee notes that at Headquarters the
projects proposed under this section fall under the responsibility of the Office of
Central Support Services and the Department of Public Information (for switching
its technological facilities from audio to digital systems). The administrative
services at Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi and the regional commissions are
responsible within their respective spheres for the implementation of their projects
under this section and the administration of related resources. The projects relating
to the safety and security of United Nations premises in all main locations proposed
under this section will be implemented in close coordination with the Department of
Safety and Security.

XI.2 The Office of Central Support Services exercises its coordinating role in
providing integrated and coordinated management policy and guidelines to locations
outside of Headquarters in implementation of projects proposed under this section.
The Advisory Committee trusts that the next budget submission will contain
information on the precise roles of the various participants in this complex
system and the extent of the Office’s authority to ensure a coordinated and
systemic approach towards capital expenditure projects.

XI.3 The Advisory Committee expects that procedures will be either put in
place or reinforced to ensure strict control over resources for capital
expenditures. The central role of the Office of Central Support Services should
be ensured both at Headquarters and at all duty stations so as to determine the
validity of requests, avoid the submission of “wish lists” and monitor approved
work against approved plans and completion targets. Particular attention
should be paid to multi-year projects.

XI.4 The Advisory Committee sought an explanation as to the criteria for placing
projects either in the category of alterations and improvements or in the category of
major maintenance. It was informed that, in general, capital-intensive projects of a
structural nature which would substantially alter or improve the facilities are
classified under alterations and improvements, while projects to repair or replace
existing installations (heating, ventilation and air conditioning, electrical, plumbing,
carpentry, etc.) in order to keep properties in good working order are classified
under major maintenance. The Secretariat also indicated that as technology changes,



181

A/60/7

the replacement of existing installations often involves the introduction of new
features and substantial improvements to facilities, thereby blurring the distinction
between the two categories.

XI.5 The Advisory Committee is of the view that criteria which distinguish
whether projects should fall in the category of alterations/improvements or
major maintenance need to be further refined; this is also necessary to avoid
instances where projects of a similar nature fall into the two different
categories at different duty stations.

XI.6 The Advisory Committee notes from A/60/6 (Sect. 32), paragraph 32.2, that
expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement for projects proposed
under this section are included within the logical framework of the Office of Central
Support Services and the administrative services at Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi and
the regional commissions, as appropriate.

XI.7 As indicated in paragraph 32.8 of the proposed budget, the decrease in
resources of $35,574,200 reflects the deletion of a one-time provision of
$49,833,300 approved by the General Assembly in its resolutions 58/295 and
59/276 for the strengthening of the security and safety of the United Nations
premises. The decrease is partly offset by growth of $8,017,500 under other
projects, relating principally to upgrading the Organization’s technological network
infrastructure in regional commissions and other duty stations in order to bring them
closer to the ICT capacity of Headquarters in New York.

XI.8 The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 32.9 of the proposed
programme budget that a number of projects included in the biennium 2006-2007
had been approved previously by the General Assembly but either had to be
deferred, owing to limited resources or the need to undertake other unforeseen
emergency projects, or are continuations of previously approved multi-year projects.
Table 32.3 of the fascicle categorizes the alteration/improvement and major
maintenance projects as projects deferred from prior periods, multi-year phased
projects, recurrent projects and new projects for 2006-2007. The Committee notes
that the cost of projects under alterations/improvements deferred from prior periods
is estimated at $325,000 for the next biennium, while the cost of major maintenance
projects deferred from prior periods totals $150,000. The Committee points out, in
this connection, that in some instances projects had to be deferred or delayed due to
poor performance by contractors. The Committee is of the view that future
budget submissions should provide full information on the reasons for which
projects had to be deferred.

XI.9 A provision of $7,724,900 is requested to standardize and upgrade the United
Nations enterprise network infrastructure at regional headquarters and regional
commissions (see A/60/6 (Sect. 32), para. 32.34). These resources would cover the
acquisition and installation of network switches and related equipment and cabling
in order to support videoconferencing, Internet protocol telephony, business
continuity requirements and real-time connectivity to United Nations enterprise
applications, such as the Integrated Management Information System, Galaxy and
future systems that would allow the sharing of security-related information. The
Advisory Committee has commented extensively on ICT-related issues in its review
of requirements of the Office of Central Support Services in part VIII above.



182

A/60/7

XI.10 The Advisory Committee reiterates its view that adequate provisions
should be maintained in the budget of the Organization for construction,
alteration, improvement and major maintenance of the United Nations
worldwide properties to avoid more costly investments in the long term (see
A/58/7, para. XI.2). Although the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that
there was no duplication in projects funded under section 32 and the capital
master plan, it requests that increased attention be paid to the issue of
complementarity of projects in order to exclude even the slightest possibility of
duplication.

Safety and security

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $184,239,600*

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $140,037,100

Projected extrabudgetary resources $7,098,500

Projected extrabudgetary resources for
jointly financed requirements $3,437,100

A summary of the proposals of the Secretary-General for regular budget
posts by budget section is contained in table 5 of the introduction to the
budget. A summary of the total number of posts by source of funds and
grade level is contained in annex I to the present report.

* At 2006-2007 rates. Figures in the present report, unless otherwise noted, are at
revised 2004-2005 rates (i.e., before recosting).

† This includes the United Nations share of $40,551,800 (before recosting) of
jointly financed safety and security costs (see para. XII.6 below).

General comments and recommendations

XII.1 The Department of Safety and Security was created by the General Assembly
in section XI of its resolution 59/276, integrating two relevant areas of activity from
the Office of Central Support Services and from jointly financed activities,
including the former Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator.
Specifically, the Department’s activities reflect a consolidation of those under the
security and safety services component for subprogramme 4, Support services, of
programme 24, Management and support services, and under section D, Inter-
organizational security measures, of programme 26, Jointly financed activities, of
the biennial programme plan for 2006-2007.

XII.2 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, a new programme 27,
Safety and security, is being submitted to the Assembly at its sixtieth session,
through the Committee for Programme and Coordination at its forty-fifth session
(see A/60/16, paras. 62-67) as an addendum to the biennial programme plan and
priorities for the period 2006-2007 (A/59/6/Rev.1 and Corr.1). The Advisory
Committee also recalls its recommendation in paragraph 17 of its report A/59/539
that an implementation report on the full range of activities, be submitted to the
General Assembly at its sixtieth session.

XII.3 With regard to cost-sharing arrangements, the programme budget proposal
indicates that the financial responsibility of each participating organization is based
on its proportional share of personnel operating in the field. The percentage share of
each organization in financing those costs during 2006-2007 was established by the
United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination at its first regular



184

A/60/7

session of 2005, held in April. The cost-sharing arrangements at Vienna are based
on a formula agreed upon by the organizations located at the Vienna International
Centre. The total jointly financed budget of the Department of Safety and Security
amounts to $199,280,800 before recosting (see table below).

XII.4 The Advisory Committee recalls its comments contained in its report on a
strengthened and unified security management system for the United Nations
(A/59/539, paras. 27-33), where it recommends the continuation of cost-sharing
arrangements for field-related costs among the organizations that participate in and
use the system of services of the United Nations field security management system.
The Committee continues to emphasize that it is important that all concerned
share ownership of the system, with the right to participate in decision-making
and the responsibility of sharing in resulting costs. It trusts that the system now
in place will be refined on the basis of experiences as needs dictate.

XII.5 With regard to the 2006-2007 programme budget proposal, the Advisory
Committee regrets that the presentation in the budget fascicle (A/60/6 (Sect.
33)) was structured with separate tables, presenting, on the one hand, resource
requirements for regular and extrabudgetary resources and posts (tables 33.3
and 33.4) and, on the other hand, jointly financed resource and post
requirements (tables 33.6 and 33.7). It was not immediately clear how the
separate requirements were related to each other. In order to obtain a complete
overview, further clarifications had to be sought during the hearings to confirm
the accuracy of the Committee’s manual recalculation of data. The Committee
trusts that, in future, a clear and concise summary table will precede any
separate resource tables.

XII.6 Resource requirements are summarized in the table below. The consolidated
requirements and estimate for the 2006-2007 biennium (before recosting) amount to
$340,946,300 (net), including the United Nations share of jointly financed safety
and security costs ($40,551,800).

A/60/7

XII.7 As noted in paragraph 33.8 of the proposed budget, the resources required
for the 2006-2007 biennium under the regular budget amount to $171,681,700
(before recosting); this amount reflects an increase of $31,644,600. The total
proposed amount includes the United Nations share, $40,551,800, of jointly
financed safety and security costs. The Advisory Committee notes that a number of
requirements are not new but are in fact due to the delayed impact of resources and
posts:

(a) Under executive direction and management, the increase of $3,059,500
relates to the delayed impact of the full cost of new posts established in the
biennium 2004-2005 by the General Assembly in its resolution 59/276 in the context
of strengthening the security management system of the United Nations;

(b) Under programme of work, the net increase of $26,522,700 relates to:

(i) A net increase of $16,835,100 under subprogramme 1, comprising the
increase of $24,514,700 for the delayed impact of the full cost of new posts
established in 2004-2005, and a decrease of $7,679,600 for non-post
requirements, reflecting the discontinuation of one-time costs approved for the
biennium 2004-2005 under General Assembly resolutions 58/295 and 59/276
for various operational requirements under the subprogramme;

(ii) An increase of $8,808,900 under subprogramme 2, relating to an increase
for non-post requirements representing the United Nations share in safety and
security costs to be financed on a cost-sharing basis with other organizations;

(iii) An increase of $878,700 under subprogramme 3, relating to an increase
for non-post requirements representing the United Nations share on a cost-
sharing basis with other organizations;

(c) Under programme support, a net increase of $2,062,400 comprises an
increase of $2,066,900 for the delayed impact of the full cost of new posts
established in 2004-2005. This is partly offset by a decrease of $4,500 for non-post
requirements, representing the abolition of one-time requirements approved in
resolution 59/276 for the biennium 2004-2005.

Recommendations on non-post resources

XII.8 Requirements under the regular budget for other staff costs, including
general temporary assistance and overtime, amount to $10,732,500 (before
recosting), which is $1,307,100 (10.9 per cent) below the 2004-2006 appropriation
of $12,039,600. From supplementary information provided to it, the Advisory
Committee notes that the bulk of the proposed requirement is included under
subprogramme 1, Security and safety coordination, with $2,446,000 proposed for
general temporary assistance, in addition to $6,278,400 for overtime. Upon enquiry
as to the high level of projected expenditure, the Committee was informed that this
was due to increased security staff requirements during the main part of the session
of the General Assembly, as well as to the fact that the staffing of the Department of
Safety and Security is not yet at full capacity. The Committee was informed that
most staff would be on board during October 2005 and therefore prior to the start of
the 2006-2007 biennium (see para XII.16 below). The Committee would have
expected a further reduction reflecting the fact that the Department would
presumably be adequately staffed by the onset of the new biennium. The
Committee trusts that the Department will monitor its expenditures in this



186

A/60/7

respect and recommends an update on the matter in its implementation report
to be presented to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session (see para. XII.2
above).

XII.9 The Advisory Committee was informed that training activities under
subprogramme 3 are associated with critical-incident stress management and
security and safety training. The Committee notes the importance of training for the
Department’s staff, as well as for staff working in a wide range of the Organization’s
activities. The Committee trusts that the Department will monitor training-
related expenditures and will undertake careful planning with a view to
ensuring that training is cost-effective. The Committee recommends that the
Department include a detailed training plan with its implementation report to
be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.

XII.10 Requirements for travel of staff amount to $1,342,600 (before recosting),
which is $16,400 (1.2 per cent) below the 2004-2006 appropriation of $1,359,000.
The Advisory Committee notes the small decrease and the importance of travel
resources for the activities of the Department. With regard to travel relating to the
Department’s Policy, Planning and Coordination Unit and the Compliance,
Evaluation and Monitoring Unit, there may be an overlap of activities, in particular
with a view to risk-assessment activities, as well as training workshops and
seminars. The Advisory Committee trusts that travel activities will be planned
using clearly defined terms of reference to ensure the prudent use of travel
resources and expects that once the Department has developed a comprehensive
strategic action plan, its overall travel requirements will be adjusted.

XII.11 With regard to the Organization’s malicious acts insurance policy, the
Advisory Committee notes from supplementary information provided to it that
an amount of $15,255,700 is proposed for the insurance policy for the 2006-
2007 biennium; this represents a decrease of $304,400 from the revised
appropriation of $15,560,100 for the 2004-2005 biennium, due to the
achievement of an overall premium reduction by negotiating with the
underwriter.

XII.12 However, the Advisory Committee points out that the 2006-2007 estimate
was based on 2004-2005 unadjusted assumptions on the total population and
type of duty stations to be covered. In this connection, the Committee was
informed that, as at 1 July 2005, malicious acts insurance policy cost
projections for the 2004-2005 biennium were revised upward to $19,960,100,
primarily because the number of staff covered by the insurance policy
increased from 40,062 in 2003 to 61,848. The Committee questioned how this
new data would affect the estimate for 2006-2007. Information provided did not
clarify this issue. The Committee trusts that a more comprehensive explanation
will be made in the coming months and will be submitted to the Fifth
Committee during its consideration of the programme budget proposal.

XII.13 The Advisory Committee notes from table 33.8 (a) of the proposed
programme budget that the 2006-2007 target for malicious deaths was a reduction
by 50 per cent of the 2004-2005 estimated total of 15. The Committee was informed
that the Department of Safety and Security and the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations maintain separate databases with regard to fatal and non-fatal incidents.
The Committee was informed that some efforts were under way to merge the
databases. The Committee regrets that these efforts were not undertaken earlier,



187

A/60/7

even prior to the creation of the Department of Safety and Security, and points
out that the merging of databases is a simple information-sharing task between
two Departments within the Organization. The Committee trusts that both
Departments will endeavour to ensure an overall environment of transparency,
mutual cooperation and data-sharing.

Presentation

XII.14 The Advisory Committee notes that the indicators used in the presentation
were, overall, of high quality. However, inconsistencies and vague references were
apparent in some instances. For example, table 33.8 (c) of the proposed budget
indicates a target “compliance” rate of only 80 per cent of duty stations with
minimum operating security standards during 2006-2007, while tables 33.12 (a) (i)
and 33.15 (a) (i) point to an “establishment” rate of 100 per cent. The Committee
notes the explanation, provided during the hearings, that this was due to the
applicability of a variety of management performance indicators. The Committee
emphasizes that, in the interest of safety and security of staff, the standard
should be in compliance with minimum operating security standards and that
this must be applied as a simple uniform standard indicator without room for
leniency. With regard to the Department’s dual responsibility, referred to in
paragraph 33.7 of the proposed programme budget, the Committee points out that
the related indicators and factors could be more explicit. For example, under the
heading “External factors”, paragraph 33.19 (b) indicates the assumption that all
stakeholders will be “supportive of the Department’s efforts and extend to it full
cooperation”, while paragraph 33.35 (a) presents the assumption that “the
organizations participating in the security management system and their staff extend
full cooperation”. However, there was no reference to how full cooperation would
be ensured and measured. The Committee trusts that, in future, the presentation
will provide more specific details, with clear references to the Department’s
overall strategic action plan and/or concept of operations.

Other comments and recommendations

XII.15 With regard to staffing, the Advisory Committee notes that the overall level
of proposed staffing requirements under regular and extrabudgetary resources is
expected to remain unchanged from the revised 2004-2005 level, at 1,822 posts,
including 854 jointly financed posts. The Committee was informed that this was due
to the fact that the Department was still in the initial stage of its establishment.

XII.16 The Advisory Committee is cognizant that the Department is still in its start-
up phase and that efforts to recruit personnel are under way. In this respect, the
Committee was informed that it was expected that most posts would be filled by
October 2005 and that the Department would then be adequately staffed, prior to the
beginning of the 2006-2007 biennium.

XII.17 With regard to cooperation with other entities, the Advisory Committee
commends the Department for fully involving United Nations agencies, funds
and programmes in the process of selection of personnel for P-4 and P-5 posts
in the field and ensuring the active participation of agencies, funds and
programmes on relevant panels. The Committee also commends the
Department for requesting UNOPS to undertake screening for applicants at the
P-3 and P-4 levels. Furthermore, the Department is in the process of compiling



188

A/60/7

an in-house roster of candidates, vetted by the Office of Human Resources
Management, for the speedy recruitment of security personnel required on
short notice in the field. The Committee trusts that the Department’s
implementation report to the General Assembly will include details regarding
vacancy management and progress made on the recruitment of staff.

XII.18 The Advisory Committee notes that the Department is planning to develop
career-path opportunities for its staff and trusts that these efforts will be undertaken
in conjunction with the Office of Human Resources Management.

XII.19 The Advisory Committee was informed that the Organization’s
cumbersome and complex procedures for recruitment and placement of staff
present a challenge for the recruitment of qualified personnel. The Committee
notes that the Department is making every effort to “work with the system” but
points out that this matter is not unique to the Department of Safety and
Security.

XII.20 The Advisory Committee understands that in integrating staff from various
programmes and agencies problems may arise because of differences in conditions
of service. The Committee notes that the Office of Internal Oversight Services has
recommended that the Department consult with the International Civil Service
Commission whenever there is any requirement involving special conditions of
service. The Committee was informed that, globally, 150 duty stations were
administered by UNDP, which provides a range of backstopping support, such as
local staff, recruitment support and office space and equipment. The reimbursement
of the cost of administrative support services provided by UNDP in the field under
the terms of a 2002 memorandum of understanding is included under contractual
services.

XII.21 The Advisory Committee was informed that the Department’s rapid-reaction
capacity was still under development and that consideration was being given to
developing a regional capacity for quick deployment. A similar rapid-reaction
capacity, albeit not for security-specific functions, has been successfully used by the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which has developed a rapid-deployment
roster of specialized staff who remain with their offices on a day-to-day basis but
are available for quick deployment during mission start-up phases. In this respect,
rapid deployment staff are rotated in and out of the roster and remain on call for a
certain period of time only. The Department of Safety and Security may wish to
consider a similar approach and perhaps consult with the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations on the modalities of developing and maintaining a rapid-
reaction roster.

XII.22 The Advisory Committee notes that the Office of the Under-Secretary-
General will include a Policy, Planning and Coordination Unit, as well as a
Compliance, Evaluation and Monitoring Unit. The Committee trusts that the
Units will be staffed expeditiously with experienced personnel to ensure that
policies, including standard operating manuals, and inspection and compliance
activities can be undertaken as preventive measures. The Committee points out
that the newness of the Department presents a unique situation in that a solid
foundation must be laid for management practices and day-to-day operations
so as to ensure long-term effectiveness and efficiency. In this connection, the
Committee was informed that the Department was endeavouring to develop a
strategic action plan, including an accountability framework. The Committee



189

A/60/7

emphasizes the importance of a well-formulated concept of operations, in
particular during a department’s start-up phase, to ensure the early
introduction of guidelines, policies and accountability frameworks as a
preventive measure and to implement a stable foundation to facilitate the good
management of its operations in the long run.

XII.23 With regard to cooperation in field locations administered by the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Advisory Committee points out
that there is a need to formulate procedures to allow for maximum cooperation
and integration with the military components of peacekeeping operations. The
latter are ultimately responsible for the overall security of a peacekeeping
operation, specifically with regard to providing military security during the
relocation or evacuation of staff. In addition, there is a need to set parameters
regarding security for the protection of United Nations facilities at
peacekeeping operations (compounds, field offices away from headquarter
locations and logistics facilities, including warehouses, communications
facilities, airfields, etc.). With regard to the Department’s planning for staffing
requirements, there may also be a need to collaborate with the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations to determine an appropriate ratio between military
and civilian security capacities. The Committee trusts that the Department will
develop a comprehensive concept of operations document without delay and
recommends that it provide an update on this matter in its implementation
report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.

Part XIII
Development Account

Section 34
Development Account

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $13,065,000

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $13,065,000

XIII.1 The proposal submitted by the Secretary-General would bring the amount
placed in the Development Account since its creation to $65.3 million. The
Committee was informed that expenditure performance for 66 projects, since the
inception of the Development Account, was as follows: in the first allocation,
consisting of 7 projects, 98.3 per cent of the overall project resources were utilized
and all projects were completed; in the second allocation, for 16 projects, 93.4 per
cent of the resources were expended and 11 projects have been completed (the
remaining 5 are close to completion or will close before the end of the year); in the
third allocation, for 20 projects, 77.7 per cent of the overall resources were
expended, 5 projects have been completed and 3 are close to completion; in the
fourth allocation, for 23 projects, 19 per cent of the overall resources have been
utilized but no projects have been completed as yet.

XIII.2 The fifth allocation of the Development Account, proposed for 2006-2007, is
for 24 projects to be implemented, bringing the total number of projects financed by
the Development Account to 90. The 24 projects were selected, on the basis of the
criteria set out in General Assembly resolution 53/220 A (see A/60/6 (Sect. 34),
para. 34.8), from a broader pool of 60 projects originating in the 10 entities of the
Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs. The Advisory Committee
notes that number of criteria used, initially 5, has increased to 10 (see A/59/397,
para. 10). The Committee was informed this reflected experience gained from
implementation.

XIII.3 For the projects proposed for 2006-2007, broader emphasis is placed on the
enhancement of statistical capacity-building as the basis on which to follow the
trends and needs of development. Moreover, the Advisory Committee notes that the
number of projects to be executed jointly by the regional commissions has
increased, reflecting effective utilization of resources, knowledge-sharing and
experience accumulated as regards the benefits of horizontal collaboration as an
important and productive element in operational projects. In this connection,
information provided to the Committee showed that for the 23 projects approved for
the fourth tranche (2004-2005), the regional commissions are involved in 13 of
them, whereas for the fifth tranche, the regional commissions are involved in 20 of
them. In addition, while the initial tranches allocated more resources for equipment,
particularly information technology equipment, the fifth one reflects greater demand
for advisory services and intellectual assistance, networking and partnerships.

XIII.4 Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with a compilation of
projected expenditures of the fifth tranche by budget line (see table below).



191

A/60/7

Projected expenditures, fifth tranche

Budget line
Amount (thousands of
United States dollars) Percentage

General temporary assistance 911.5 7

Consultants and experts 2 984.9 22.9

Expert group meetings 811.9 6.2

Travel 1 494.0 11.4

Contractual services 2 523.8 19.3

General operating expenses 456.5 3.5

Training 3 882.4 29.7

Total 13 065.0 100

XIII.5 The Advisory Committee was informed that expenditure under the first three
items have decreased from the level of the first, second and third tranches.
Moreover, as regards consultants and experts, local expertise is used in all regional
commissions in order to build knowledge, ensure sustainability and strengthen
national capacity. The support costs related to projects financed from the
Development Account are absorbed within the administrative capacity of the
Secretariat. As to monitoring and evaluation, the Committee notes that this is part of
the project implementation costs, and that up to 2 per cent is allocated for project
evaluation.

XIII.6 The Advisory Committee points out the need to improve the pace of
implementation of Development Account projects. In this connection, the
Committee was informed that the protracted and delayed pace of implementation,
particularly in regard to the first two tranches of the Development Account, has
improved because of a clearer understanding of the objectives and greater
experience in implementing projects. The Committee recommends that attention
be paid to the need to execute projects within two bienniums, consistent with
the decision of the General Assembly.

XIII.7 In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that extensive use of web-
based technology assists in the management of the Development Account and that
much of the programming and implementation cycle is developed and monitored by
electronic means. The Committee was informed that the results-based budgeting
framework provides a helpful tool to follow up on entities executing the projects.
Moreover, through the systematic use of the log-frame approach in the fourth and
the fifth tranches, the programme manager will be able to improve the reporting of
results. The Committee commends the information provided on the website,
including detailed information on the Development Account and individual
projects.

XIII.8 The Advisory Committee requested additional information regarding lessons
learned from the execution of Development Account projects under the first four
tranches. The Committee was informed that, in line with the criteria established by
the General Assembly for project implementation, which should demonstrably
strengthen national development capacity, particular attention is given to project
sustainability, the use of information and communication technology, networking of



192

A/60/7

expertise, utilization of partnerships and South-South cooperation, and an emphasis
on multiplier effects. One important way of ensuring sustainability is to have the
consistent and proactive involvement of stakeholders in project design and
implementation, at both the conceptual and operational levels, which in many cases
has led to a number of follow-up activities through voluntary initiatives and
additional training events by stakeholders; another way is to promote the co-
financing of pilot activities by partners, attracting financial and technical support
from bilateral and/or multilateral donors, thereby enabling the continuation of
activities after a project’s completion.

XIII.9 The Advisory Committee notes that ICT is at the core of many Development
Account projects because of its multiplier potential and adaptability to development
activities beyond the project scope. The building of knowledge networks supported
by ICT allows developing countries to have direct access to information on good
practices. The Committee was further informed that the networking of local
expertise offers collaborative opportunities, often beyond those originally
envisioned by project designers, and creates additional regional and interregional
links conducive to capacity-building in specific fields, leading to further
networking, technical assistance and knowledge-sharing, as has been the case with
distance-learning initiatives. In addition, a valuable lesson learned is that many
project activities can be replicated by scaling up or down, depending on demand.

XIII.10 The Advisory Committee enquired as to its comments regarding the risk of
undertaking too many small projects which are spread very thinly, making it
difficult to measure impacts because of the small amount of resources involved for
each project. The Committee was informed that the allocation of resources in the
range of $300,000 to $600,000 per project, with the exception of joint ones where
all regional commissions participate, has proved reasonable and efficient for the
following reasons:

(a) Since most of the projects are of a pilot nature, once they are successfully
completed a similar one may be implemented on a larger scale, including in other
parts of the developing world. In addition, the focus of most projects is on the
facilitation of networking of local expertise, which does not require expensive
infrastructure-building activities. At the same time, knowledge management
activities, while varying from case to case, may be implemented effectively,
drawing upon the institutional knowledge of the Organization;

(b) Given that project budgets do not allow for creating substantial support
structures and that project execution relies largely upon United Nations staff already
available, smaller projects are easier to complete within the expected two
bienniums. This approach has delivered immediate results for projects funded under
the third and, most recently, the fourth tranche;

(c) Most members of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social
Affairs are very keen to have an opportunity to test new approaches to capacity-
building which draw on their work in support of normative processes and policy
analysis.

XIII.11 As stated in paragraph V.84 above, the Secretary-General submitted a report
entitled “Review of the regular programme of technical cooperation and the
Development Account” (A/59/397) in response to the request in paragraphs 48 and
58 of General Assembly resolution 58/270. The comments of the Advisory



193

A/60/7

Committee on the regular programme of technical cooperation are contained in
paragraphs V.84-V.91 above. The Committee notes that the report of the Secretary-
General provides an analysis of the similarities and differences between the two
programmes, including legislative histories and operating modalities. The operating
modalities of the Development Account are set out in paragraphs 59 to 70 and its
relevance is stated in paragraphs 72 and 73 of the report. In section VII of the
report, the Secretary-General makes proposals for the approval of a statement of
objective for the Development Account (para. 107) and for reconsidering its funding
level, which was established in 1997 (para. 108-109); in section VIII, it is proposed
to combine sections 23 and 35 into one budget section (para. 112). The General
Assembly may wish to take a policy decision regarding the first two proposals.

XIII.12 As to the third proposal, the Advisory Committee recalls that, in paragraph
XIII.11 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-
2005,4 it recommended that the Development Account and the regular programme of
technical cooperation sections of the budget be combined into one section with
separate parts, not only to facilitate programme reporting, but to assist in the
examination of the Development Account and the role of advisory services. The
Committee notes that the report of the Secretary-General states that, besides the fact
that the presentation would result in a slightly simplified overall structure, it is
possible that “some savings in governance time and perhaps a better informed
discussion could be achieved” if the two programmes were considered together
(A/59/397, para. 112). The Committee therefore reiterates its recommendation
on combining the two sections into one, with two parts.



194

A/60/7

Part XIV
Staff assessment

Section 35
Staff assessment

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $433,529,400

Revised appropriation for 2004-2005 $411,194,200

XIV.1 The salary and related emoluments of United Nations staff members are
subject to the assessment set out in regulation 3.3 of the Staff Regulations of the
United Nations and amendments thereto. The Advisory Committee notes that, for
the purpose of comparability with the work programme and budget proposals of
other organizations of the United Nations system, the Secretary-General has
estimated the staff costs net of staff assessment under the various expenditure
sections of the proposed programme budget. The difference between gross and net
salaries amounts to $433,529,400 after recosting for 2006-2007, and that amount is
requested by the Secretary-General as a global amount under section 35.

XIV.2 The Advisory Committee notes that, in accordance with the current
budgetary procedure of the United Nations, amounts withheld in the form of staff
assessment are considered revenue of the Organization. Accordingly, the amount of
$433,529,400 requested under section 35 is reflected in income section 1, Income
from staff assessment, which, in addition, includes staff assessment in the amount of
$4,409,500 from staff charged to revenue-producing activities, as indicated in
A/60/6 (Income sect. 1), paragraph IS1.1.



195

A/60/7

B. Estimates of income

Income section 1
Income from staff assessment

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $437,938,900

Approved estimate for 2004-2005 $415,613,700

IS1.1 In the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, the
Secretary-General estimates the amount of staff assessment under expenditure
section 35, Staff assessment, and income section 3, Services to the public, to be
$437,938,900. The amount of staff assessment not otherwise disposed of by specific
resolution of the General Assembly will be credited to the Tax Equalization Fund,
established by the Assembly in its resolution 973 A (X) of 15 December 1955, for
distribution to Member States in accordance with the scale of assessments for the
regular budget applicable to the financial year concerned (see A/60/6 (Income
sect. 1), para. IS1.2).

IS1.2 The total estimate under income section 1 is $4,409,500 more than the total
estimate under section 35 because the former includes income from staff assessment
derived from emoluments of staff charged to revenue-producing activities under
income section 3; on the other hand, the staff assessment paid to such staff is shown
under income section 3 rather than section 35.

Income section 2
General income

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $21,074,300

Approved estimate for 2004-2005 $24,009,500

IS2.1 Estimates under this section relate to income from rental of premises,
reimbursement for services provided to specialized agencies, bank interest, sale of
used equipment, refunds from previous years’ expenditures, contributions of non-
member States, television and similar services and miscellaneous income. As
indicated in A/60/6 (Income sect. 2), tables IS2.1 and IS2.2, the estimate of total
general income for the biennium 2006-2007 amounts to $21,074,300, a decrease of
$2,935,200 from the estimate of $24,009,500 for 2004-2005. Decreases projected
under rental of premises ($532,100), reimbursement for services provided to
specialized agencies and others ($3,090,700), sale of used equipment ($9,600),
television and similar services ($13,900) and miscellaneous income ($293,800) are
only partly offset by increases under bank interest ($796,000), refunds of previous
years’ expenditures ($208,500) and contributions of non-member States ($400).

IS2.2 Under rental of premises, a decrease of $2,346,800 at Headquarters is
attributable mainly to the application of actual rent and maintenance expenses rather
than commercial rates to the new Department of Safety and Security, which is
financed jointly by all the participating agencies. The movement of tenants, in



196

A/60/7

particular the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, also accounts for part of the
decrease. The estimated increases at Geneva ($1,365,800), Addis Ababa ($384,300)
and Bangkok ($65,300) are due to a combination of factors, including higher rental
rates, more space being rented out and currency fluctuations.

IS2.3 The most significant decrease, under reimbursement for services provided to
specialized agencies and others, amounting to $2 million, is due to the full
amortization in the preceding biennium of the $16 million loan made to the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization by the United Nations.

IS2.4 The Advisory Committee notes that income from television and similar
services continues to decline, with expected income for 2006-2007 estimated at
$135,000, $13,900 less than the $148,900 for 2004-2005. The Committee was
informed that, as in the previous biennium, the decrease was due to reciprocal
arrangements between the Department of Public Information and business partners,
and that as a result of these arrangements that Department was able to achieve wider
dissemination of its materials, which was facilitated through the use of digital
technology. The Committee recalls that considerable investments have been made in
a major project, started in the biennium 2000-2001 by the News and Media
Division, for the modernization of the Department’s production and broadcast
infrastructure, including further digitization and use of the Internet for the
dissemination of news materials. In this regard, a further $1,094,000 had been
requested for the biennium 2004-2005 under section 33, Construction, alteration,
improvement and major maintenance. The Committee is concerned about the
continued drop in income and requests that information on the possibility of
recovering the considerable investments made be provided in the next budget
submission.

IS2.5 Upon request the Advisory Committee was provided with a breakdown of the
items under sale of used equipment (see A/60/6 (Income sect. 2), para. IS2.4). The
Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the bulk of miscellaneous income
recorded in 2004 was from unclaimed repatriation grants reported by the United
Nations Office at Geneva ($286,500) and from the recycling programme at
Headquarters ($155,300). In response to a query on the disposition of gifts received
by the Secretary-General, the Committee was merely informed that they were not
sold. The Committee requests that, in future, detailed breakdowns of these
items, as well as more complete information on the treatment of gifts received
by the Secretary-General and other officials in accordance with applicable
procedures (see ST/SGB/2005/5), be included in the supplementary information
provided to it. This information should also be reflected, as appropriate, in the
performance report.

Income section 3
Services to the public

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $5,445,200

Approved estimate for 2004-2005 $4,228,700

IS3.1 The Advisory Committee was informed that developments with respect to the
capital master plan may affect the operations of the units providing services to the



197

A/60/7

public and other revenue-producing activities and consequently have an impact on
projected revenues. A description of the revenue-producing activities provided for
under this section is contained in paragraph IS.3.3 of A/60/6 (Income sect. 3).

United Nations Postal Administration

IS3.2 The Advisory Committee notes that following a comprehensive
reorganization of the United Nations Postal Administration (UNPA) and the
streamlining and rationalization of its operations, it has been possible to maintain its
solvency. The total projected net revenues amount to $1,646,900, a decline of
$287,400 from the level approved for 2004-2005. The personalized stamp project
has proved to be popular with visitors and has generated considerable revenue in
return for a modest investment. However, the Committee was informed that the
interest of the public in personalized stamps seems to be declining.

IS3.3 The Advisory Committee notes that the requirements requested under travel
of staff amount to $82,200 (before recosting) and are projected to increase slightly
(by $3,300) from the current biennium. The Committee was informed that the
resources requested for overtime ($80,700) were required mainly for participation in
stamp exhibitions, which often take place during weekends, for the sale of first-day-
issue stamps and other periods of peak workload. The Committee notes the high
levels of resource requirements under these objects of expenditure and cautions
against cost escalation at UNPA, given its uncertain financial situation.

IS3.4 The Committee was informed that a new e-commerce website for the sale of
stamps was in the final stages of testing and would go online shortly. UNPA hopes
to broaden its customer base through the website. The Committee welcomes this
progress and requests UNPA to report on the results achieved in the
programme budget for 2008-2009.

Sale of publications

IS3.5 Net revenue from the projected sale of publications is expected to decrease
by $884,800, from $1,838,000 to $952,200, continuing the decline of sales of
United Nations publications worldwide, which is due to a number of factors,
including the increase in online sales of products. To better respond to market trends
and halt this downward trend, the Department of Public Information proposes to
develop a capacity to sell electronic versions of all United Nations publications
through an e-commerce website. The Advisory Committee welcomes this
progress and requests the Department to report on the results achieved in the
programme budget for 2008-2009.

IS3.6 As a consequence of the refocusing of the operation towards electronic
distribution, the Department of Public Information proposes to abolish one P-2 post
at Headquarters dedicated to traditional marketing functions. In Geneva, owing to
the rationalization of the operation, one General Service post for fulfilling
individual sales orders is also proposed for abolition. The Advisory Committee
notes that it is proposed to transfer all of the functions of the Sales Dispatch Unit at
Headquarters from the Department for General Assembly and Conference
Management to the Department of Public Information (see part I, sect. 2, above).



198

A/60/7

Other revenue-producing activities

IS3.7 The total gross revenue estimates for services to visitors in 2006-2007 are
expected to rise by $2,277,600, to $8,924,000, but remain short of covering the
costs of the operation, which amount to $9,442,800. The Advisory Committee was
informed that following the sharp decrease in the number of visitors in the aftermath
of 11 September 2001, and the subsequent closings of the United Nations complex
to visitors, the numbers of visitors paying for tours had increased and seemed to be
stabilizing.

IS3.8 Concerning the revenue-producing services of the Department of
Economic and Social Affairs, the Advisory Committee questions the resource
requirements for consultants under the income section for substantive activities
such as the development of client/server applications and the improvement of
methodologies and data analyses to develop custom demographic software. In
the opinion of the Committee, these requirements should be requested under
section 9; the Committee requests that this anomaly be rectified in future
budgetary submissions. The net revenue from the sales of statistics- and
population-related products by the Department is expected to decrease by $30,200
in 2006-2007 (estimated at $367,000). However, the operation will continue to be
self-sufficient.

IS3.9 The projected gross revenue from garage operations at Headquarters, Geneva
and Bangkok for the 2006-2007 biennium would amount to $2,715,200, an increase
of $211,300 over the approved estimates for the current biennium. With total
expenses at $1,453,000, the operation would generate a net revenue of $1,262,200
and be largely self-sufficient.

IS3.10 The Advisory Committee draws attention to the fact that the sales tax of New
York state has, in recent years, been applied to the gift items sold at United Nations
Headquarters, and that the tax arguably should not be applicable in international
territory. The Committee requests that the Secretary-General continue to
pursue this matter with a view to resolving any difficulties and to restoring the
tax-free status of commercial enterprises in the Headquarters complex.

Annex IV
Cost-sharing mechanisms for jointly financed
administrative activities

1. The jointly financed administrative activities of the United Nations common
system include the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) and its
secretariat, the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) and its secretariat and the secretariat of
the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB). Two
methods, historically known as the Consultative Committee on Administrative
Questions (CCAQ) formula and JIU formula, are used for determining each
organization’s share of costs of the jointly financed bodies, which are determined as
follows:

(a) CCAQ formula — costs are apportioned on the basis of the number of
staff with appointments of one year or more at the end of the previous biennium, as
contained in the personnel statistics published yearly by the CEB secretariat;

(b) JIU formula — costs are apportioned on the basis of expenditures of the
participating organizations reported in the audited accounts, excluding the
following:

(i) Expenditures related to peacekeeping;

(ii) Expenditures in kind (including value of donated commodities);

(iii) Fifty per cent of the expenditure of the International Trade Centre,
corresponding to the World Trade Organization share, on the principle that the
regular budget of the Trade Centre is funded in equal parts by the United
Nations and the World Trade Organization, which does not participate in the
work of JIU.

2. The cost-sharing percentages for the jointly financed bodies are established as
follows:

(a) ICSC — based on the CCAQ formula;

(b) JIU — based on the JIU formula;

(c) CEB — following the establishment of CEB in 2000, the cost-sharing for
support for the High Level Committee on Programmes was based on the JIU
formula, and for the High Level Committee on Management and the Information
Systems Coordination Committee (ISCC) on the CCAQ formula. In May 2003, it
was decided to simplify the approach and to determine the share of each
organization by the average of the sum of the percentage share of each organization
towards the budgets of the three old components of CEB (CCAQ, the Consultative
Committee on Programme and Operational Questions and ISCC). Since this
breakdown of the CEB budget is no longer identifiable as from the 2004-2005
biennium, this method will have to be adjusted.

3. A summary of the United Nations percentage share of the costs of jointly
financed activities, as shown in the proposed programme budget since 2002-2003, is
provided in table 1. Participating organizations’ shares in the 2006-2007 budget
proposals of ICSC, JIU and the CEB secretariat are calculated on the basis of the
same percentages as in the current biennium. These were established on the basis of



216

A/60/7

2002 personnel statistics and 1998-1999 expenditure data which, as of July 2005,
are still the latest data available (see table 2). The percentage shares will be revised
as more current data become available. Further, the Advisory Committee was
informed that all cost-sharing arrangements and methodologies, including those for
salary survey activities and field-based security costs, are being reviewed by the
Finance and Budget Network of the High Level Committee on Management (see
chap. II, para. X.3 above).

UNRWA.
d Includes ICAT.
e Includes PAHO and UNAIDS.
f The World Tourism Organization reported 2002-2003 expenditure of €18,485,042, resulting

in a share of the JIU budget of 0.1% (originally calculated at 0.6%). Remaining shares have
been adjusted accordingly to absorb this slight revision.
