Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the
United Nations peacekeeping operations

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the statement of
programme budget implications of draft resolution
A/C.4/55/L.23, entitled “Comprehensive review of the
whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their
aspects”, submitted by the Secretary-General in
accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of
the General Assembly (A/C.5/55/46). The Committee
also had before it, as background documents, the report
of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the
recommendations of the Special Committee on
Peacekeeping Operations and the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations (A/55/977) and the report of
the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations
(A/55/1024 and Corr.1). During its consideration of the
statement, the Committee met with representatives of
the Secretary-General, who provided additional
information and clarification.

I. Background

2. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in
considering the reports of the Secretary-General on the
implementation of the report of the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations (A/55/502) and on the
related resource requirements (A/55/507 and Add.1), it
had noted that the representatives of the Secretary-
General had acknowledged that not all of the proposals
in the related resource documents could be classified as
emergencies, the postponement of which would lead to
an immediate deterioration of present peacekeeping
operations in the field. Accordingly, the Committee had
recommended approval of only those resource requests
the postponement of which could adversely affect the
backstopping of current peacekeeping operations. The
Committee had further recommended that
consideration of other post and non-post resources be
deferred until the comprehensive review and capacity
study requested by the Special Committee on
Peacekeeping Operations (see A/C.4/55/6) had been
completed and the related resource requirements to be



2
A/56/478

financed from both the support account for
peacekeeping operations and the regular budget to
implement those recommendations had been clarified
(see also A/55/676).

3. On the basis of that recommendation, the General
Assembly, in its resolution 55/238 of 23 December
2000, approved additional resources under the support
account amounting to $9,190,200 gross, which
included the establishment of 93 additional posts for
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and related
non-post requirements for the period from 1 July 2000
to 30 June 2001. By the same resolution, the Assembly
also approved an amount of $419,400 gross under the
programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, which
included the cost of two additional posts in the
Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of
Political Affairs and related non-post costs (see
A/C.5/55/46, para. 6).

4. The Advisory Committee further recalls that, on
the basis of the recommendations made in its report on
the support account for peacekeeping operations
(A/55/882), the General Assembly, in its resolution
55/271 of 14 June 2001, approved the Secretary-
General’s maintenance-level support account budget,
which amounted to $73,645,500 gross for the period
from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002.

5. The Advisory Committee notes that the statement
of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/55/46) presents the
consequential changes in resources for the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 and the
support account for peacekeeping operations for the
period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 arising from
the proposals, recommendations and conclusions of the
Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations
(A/55/1024 and Corr.1). The Special Committee
considered the report of the Secretary-General
containing the findings of the in-depth and
comprehensive managerial examination of the way in
which the Organization planned, deployed, conducted
and supported peacekeeping operations (A/55/977)
during its June 2001 session. In its draft resolution
A/C.4/55/L.23, the Fourth Committee endorsed the
proposals, recommendations and conclusions contained
in the report of the Special Committee.

6. In this regard, the Advisory Committee reiterates
previous decisions of the General Assembly concerning
the role of the Advisory Committee and the Fifth
Committee on matters related to administrative and

budgetary questions.1 The Committee also reiterates
the statement made in its previous report on the
implementation of the report of the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations that it interprets the report of
the Special Committee as a statement of policy on
priorities rather than as an attempt to determine
resources (A/55/676, para. 11).

7. The statement of the Secretary-General
summarizes the organizational issues and changes
proposed (A/C.5/55/46, paras. 12-43). The relevant
details concerning structure, staffing and other
resources are contained in an addendum to the
statement. Related matters such as integrated mission
task forces, mission leadership and in-mission
planning, the recruitment of civilian staff in
peacekeeping operations and rapid and effective
deployment capacities are also discussed (paras. 44-
62). With regard to the latter, the Committee notes
(ibid., para. 54) that the Special Committee had
endorsed the concept of a strategic reserve at the
United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, taking note
that, of the three options proposed by the Secretary-
General in his report (A/55/977), the medium strategic
reserve was the most appropriate and practical one. The
Secretary-General will submit, separately, a detailed
budget proposal for the resource requirements of the
strategic reserve and revert later to the General
Assembly on the issue of pre-mandate commitment
authority (A/C.5/55/46, para. 54). The Committee
recognizes that the strategic reserve is a significant
element in enhancing the ability of the United Nations
to address peacekeeping issues. The Committee was
also informed that a further exchange of views on
issues related to rapid and effective deployment
capabilities would be carried out in October 2001 and
that the budgetary and organizational implications of
those requirements would be submitted for the
Committee’s consideration during its winter session of
February/March 2002.

II. Presentation

8. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General
Assembly, in paragraph 10 of its resolution 55/271,
noted the intention of the Secretary-General to make
use of the results-based budgeting technique in the
presentation of the support account budget estimates.

9. In this connection, the Advisory Committee
requests that future support account budget



3
A/56/478

documents move away from an excessive use of
narratives to describe the functions and
composition of organizational units; these could be
referenced in tables, charts and graphs. The
Secretariat should instead concentrate on providing
information that justifies the totality of the
resources requested (see also para. 14 below). Plans,
objectives, expected accomplishments and benefits
should constitute the principal reference point
justifying those resources. Projects, such as those
related to information technology, should be
presented as such in a clear manner. Moreover,
initiatives for organizational change and reform,
elimination of backlogs or the preparation of
guidelines and standard operational procedures
should include a time frame for their completion.
Projected efficiency gains for projects and
initiatives should be specifically stated.

10. The Advisory Committee has stressed in the past
the need to use workload indicators to justify
resources. The Committee reiterates its position in
this regard and emphasizes the fact that it is not
interested in raw workload statistics. An analysis of
the workload should be conducted in such a way as
to inform the Committee and the General Assembly
of the risks entailed if additional resources are not
provided. Furthermore, in terms of decision-making
and assessing the resources requested, it is not
necessary to provide extensive descriptions of units;
what is needed are clear indications of continuing
and new functions that entail additional resources,
in addition to reasons why current capacity is
inadequate. Redeployment and a downward
reclassification of posts should form an integral
part of the analysis. In spite of repeated requests by
the Committee, such analysis is still lacking.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends a
complete rethinking of the way the Secretariat
justifies resources for the support account when the
results-based budgeting techniques are used in the
next budget submission.

III. Detailed examination of the
estimates

11. The additional resources proposed by the
Secretary-General amount to $25,825,800 gross, of
which $2,696,200 relates to the regular budget for the
biennium 2002-2003 and $23,129,600 gross

($21,199,600 net) relates to the last six months of the
period from 1 June 2001 to 30 June 2002 (A/C.5/55/46,
para. 63). These requirements include proposals for an
additional 216 posts, of which 9 relate to the regular
budget and 207 relate to the support account.
Information was provided to the Advisory Committee
with regard to the staffing resources requested under
the support account, by organizational unit, for the
period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (see annex I).

12. As further indicated by the Secretary-General, the
proposed change in the regular budget represents an
increase of 0.1 per cent in the resources of the
proposed programme budget for 2002-2003,2 and the
increase in the support account represents 0.9 per cent
of the level of peacekeeping costs for the current
financial period, which are projected at slightly over
$3.0 billion (ibid., para. 66).

13. The presentation and methodology used in
formulating the estimates included in the draft
resolution are set out in the Secretary-General’s
statement (ibid., para. 65). However, upon enquiry, the
Advisory Committee was informed that, if full costing
were applied to the additional resources proposed in
the statement and its addendum, they would amount to
$3,749,900 on a biennial basis for the regular budget
and to $33,494,300 for the support account on an
annual basis. The total cost of the support account on
an annual basis therefore would be $107.1 million (see
para. 4 above), or approximately 3.6 per cent of the
level of peacekeeping costs. The Committee notes,
however, that this does not take into account support
from the regular budget or from the field.

14. The Advisory Committee draws attention to
the fact that support account resources are intended
primarily to provide additional capacity at
Headquarters to manage peacekeeping operations
in the field, the amount of which depends on the
level of peacekeeping activities. The number of
associated posts must therefore be reviewed
regularly to justify the continuing need for them.
Under the circumstances, every attempt must be
made to justify the “totality” of the request for
peacekeeping support and not just additional
requests for posts and non-staff costs. The
Committee reiterates the need to take fully into
account the rationale for the establishment of the
support account and the principles and guidelines
approved by the General Assembly concerning the
expenses of peacekeeping operations (see A/55/676,



4
A/56/478

para. 10). Furthermore, the Committee emphasizes
that the current exercise should not be seen as a
general opportunity to request resources that are
not clearly and specifically related to the increase in
peacekeeping needs.

15. A total of four reclassifications are proposed in
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (1 D-2,
1 D-1, 1 P-5 and 1 P-3). In that regard, the Advisory
Committee recalls the comments and observations
made in paragraphs 47 to 49 of its first report on
the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2002-2003.3

16. As regards the additional 93 posts approved by
the General Assembly in its resolution 55/238, the
Advisory Committee was informed that recruitment to
fill 89 posts had been completed as at 10 September
2001 and that staff for 44 of those posts had reported
for duty as at 26 September. Information was provided
to the Committee on the recruitment status of the
additional 93 posts (see annex II). However, the
Committee remains of the opinion that the
recruitment process is still slow and requires
further improvement. In this connection, the
Committee draws attention to its comments in
paragraph VIII.29 of its first report on the
proposed programme budget for the biennium
2002-20033 and to General Assembly resolution
55/258 of 14 June 2001.

Section 3
Political affairs

17. The Secretary-General is proposing additional
resources of $428,800 net under the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 related
to the establishment of the secretariat of the Executive
Committee on Peace and Security, inclusive of three
new posts (1 D-1, 1 P-4 and 1 General Service (Other
level)) and related common service costs, as shown in
tables 3.1 and 3.2 of the addendum to the statement of
the Secretary-General on the programme budget
implications of draft resolution A/C.4/55/L.23
(A/C.5/55/46/Add.1). The Advisory Committee recalls
that a P-5 post was redeployed in the context of the
programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999 to
assist the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs
as convenor of the Executive Committee.4

18. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
Executive Committee on Peace and Security, since its
establishment in 1997, has doubled its membership
from 6 to 12, placing a greater burden on the convenor,
the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, who,
in the absence of a standing secretariat, relies on staff
in his office to provide support to the Executive
Committee while also performing all their other duties.
Moreover, of the four established executive
committees, the Executive Committee on Peace and
Security needs to meet more frequently but has the
smallest secretariat support structure (ibid., para. 3.3).
The Committee was further informed that while the
Executive Committee met 26 times a year, the United
Nations Development Group and the Executive
Committee on Humanitarian Affairs met 10 or 11 times
a year, and the Executive Committee on Economic and
Social Affairs met every second month (23 times since
its inception in 1997). The United Nations
Development Group is supported by a secretariat of
approximately 15 Professional staff; the Executive
Committee on Humanitarian Affairs is served by 3
Professional staff in New York; and the Executive
Committee on Economic and Social Affairs is serviced
by 2 Professionals.

19. The Advisory Committee notes that the Special
Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, while
acknowledging the need for greater coordination
among United Nations departments and agencies to
avoid duplication and improve effectiveness in the
conduct of peacekeeping operations, recommended that
the Secretary-General consider the establishment of a
small support secretariat to service the Executive
Committee on Peace and Security (A/55/1024 and
Corr.1, para. 132). An autonomous entity receiving
guidance from the Executive Committee is proposed to
be established as a common service for all of its
members. The Committee recommends the
establishment of one P-5 (instead of a D-1) post, one
P-4 and one General Service (Other level) post for
the secretariat of the Executive Committee on Peace
and Security, and that the non-staff costs ($40,100)
be absorbed within the estimates to be approved
under section 3 of the proposed programme budget
for the biennium 2002-2003. The Committee notes
that the executive committees were designed as
instruments of policy development, decision-making
and management (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 3.2).
Yet the Committee understands that this goal is yet to
be realized in the case of the Executive Committee on



5
A/56/478

Peace and Security. It is the opinion of the
Committee that unless the Executive Committee
properly and efficiently discharges its functions, the
mere establishment of a secretariat will not
necessarily remedy its present shortcomings.

Section 5
Peacekeeping operations

20. The resource growth proposed for the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations under the support account
for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 is
estimated at $15,034,700 gross, with an initial
appropriation of $52,924,000 (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1,
table 5.1). The resources proposed comprise
$8,693,000 gross for an additional 129 temporary posts
(3 D-2, 1 D-1, 9 P-5, 68 P-4/3 and 48 General Service
(3 at the Principal level)), including the reclassification
of 4 posts (1 D-2, 1 D-1, 1 P-5 and 1 P-3) and
$6,341,700 for non-post requirements. Upon enquiry,
the Advisory Committee was informed that of the
currently authorized 442 support account posts for the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, 43 were
vacant as at 26 September 2001.

21. The Advisory Committee benefited from an
extensive exchange of views with the Under-Secretary-
General and other senior representatives of the
Department. The Committee notes that the
comprehensive review identified weaknesses in several
areas: the general management culture of the
Department, internal coordination mechanisms, mid- to
long-term planning capacity and certain aspects of the
Department’s support of missions in areas such as
human resources and the provision of guidelines and
operational materials. The Under-Secretary-General
informed the Committee that in order to deal with those
shortcomings, five strategic goals or priorities had been
identified: reforming the Department’s management
culture, reorienting its relationship with field missions,
enhancing its rapid and effective deployment
capabilities, strengthening its relationship with
Member States and strengthening its relationship with
other parts of the United Nations system.

22. The Advisory Committee notes that the
Secretary-General has provided a detailed indication of
the division of labour between the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of
Management in support of peacekeeping operations
(A/55/977, annex J). However, after careful study of

the documents before it and from the testimony of
the representatives of the Secretary-General, the
Committee has concluded that greater effort should
be made to further clarify the relationships and
interactions between the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and other offices in the
Department of Management, especially those
dealing with personnel, financial administration
and control, management of procurement activities
and monitoring of delegated authority. A more
effective and efficient division of labour,
responsibility and accountability between those
departments would be secured through the early
completion of existing information system projects
at Headquarters with connectivity to field missions.
The Committee calls attention to its comments in
paragraphs 4 to 18 of its first report on the
proposed programme budget for the biennium
2002-2003.3

23. The proposal of the Secretary-General for
restructuring the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations is summarized in his statement of
programme budget implications (A/C.5/55/46,
paras. 13-25) and set out in detail in section 5 of its
addendum. The Advisory Committee was informed that
on the basis of the counting criteria used by the
Department, the new structure would comprise 84
organizational entities, as compared with the current
77. The Committee cautions that an increase in the
number of organizational units in a department
does not necessarily facilitate coordination nor
enhance administrative and management capacity.
The proposed structure should therefore be
carefully monitored with a view to adjusting it in
the light of future experience (see para. 66 below).

24. The Advisory Committee also noted references to
surge capacity related to the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations (see, for example,
A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, paras. 5.29 and 5.37). Upon
enquiry, the representatives of the Secretary-General
reiterated to the Committee that surge capacity would
be met by the provision of an adequate level of
resources to address the current situation, thereby
providing a degree of flexibility to manage and absorb
sudden increases in the workload.

Office of the Under-Secretary-General

25. In order to implement the reform of the
Department’s management culture, it is proposed to



6
A/56/478

readjust the structure of the Office of the Under-
Secretary-General, adding a D-2 post for the position
of Director of Management who will be responsible for
overhauling and strengthening the entire Department’s
management system and practices (ibid., para. 5.3). In
this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that the
front offices of the respective Assistant Secretaries-
General are also strengthened in order to ensure a
sufficiently strong administrative network throughout
the Department, particularly during the process of
managerial enhancement and change (see A/55/977,
para. 57). An additional four posts are therefore
requested, in the following front offices, to coordinate
with the Director of Management: one P-4 in the Office
of the Assistant Secretary-General for Operations; one
P-5 in the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for
Mission Support; one P-3 in the Office of the Military
Adviser, Military Division; and one P-4 in the Office of
the Civilian Police Adviser, Civilian Police Division
(see A/C.5/55/46, paras. 5.32, 5.42, 5.115 and 5.129).

26. The Advisory Committee stresses that the
management of each of the entities comprising the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations ultimately
has to be the responsibility of the head of the
Department. The Under-Secretary-General and his
senior staff cannot absolve themselves of this
responsibility — they are ultimately accountable to
the Secretary-General for the proper functioning of
the units under their supervision and for the
responsibilities entrusted to them in this regard.

27. That being stated, at a time of reform and
change, there is a justifiable need to designate, on a
temporary basis, an individual who would assist top
managers in the day-to-day tasks of initiating and
managing proposed reforms and change. As such,
the proposed function would be better described as
Director of Change Management.

28. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the proposed D-2, as well as the P-5, 2
P-4 and P-3 posts referred to in paragraph 25
above, in order to initiate and manage the necessary
process of change in the Department. However, the
need to continue those posts should be reviewed
once the reforms have been firmly established (see
para. 66 below). In this connection, use should be
made of existing staff or staff recruited against
vacancies in existing posts to develop, within the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, a cadre of
mid-level qualified managers, in the P-4 to P-5

levels, who can provide managerial assistance at
Headquarters and be available for field assignment
from time to time — particularly during the start-
up or expansion phases of missions.

29. Other changes in the front office of the Under-
Secretary-General include the establishment of a P-4
post for a political affairs officer, a P-4 post for an
administrative management officer and two General
Service (Other level) posts for an administrative
assistant and an information management assistant (see
ibid., paras. 5.5 and 5.7). A proposal to upgrade a
current P-4 post to the P-5 level for a senior political
affairs officer/external relations officer as well as that
of a current P-2 to the P-3 level for a political affairs
officer/correspondence officer is also proposed (ibid.,
paras. 5.4 and 5.6). The Advisory Committee
recommends acceptance of the P-4 post for the
administrative management officer and the two
General Service posts related to the support of the
functions of the Director of Management. The
Committee also recommends approval of the
upgrade to the P-3 level for the political affairs
officer/correspondence officer. The Committee does
not recommend acceptance of the upgrade from P-4
to P-5 of the senior political affairs officer/external
relations officer. The Committee recommends
acceptance of the proposed new P-4 post for a
political affairs officer.

Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit

30. The Advisory Committee notes that the
Secretary-General is proposing to strengthen the
Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit and to broaden its
mandate (see ibid., para. 5.10). Four distinct functional
elements are delineated (peacekeeping best practices
and policy, public information, gender and
peacekeeping and the Resource Centre), for which 19
new posts are requested (13 Professional and 6 General
Service (Other level)), in addition to the current
staffing of 8.

31. As for the peacekeeping best practices and policy
function, the Advisory Committee notes that a total of
11 new posts are proposed (5 P-4, 2 P-3, and 4 General
Service (Other level)) (see ibid., para. 5.11). The
Committee recommends acceptance of three
additional posts to develop guidelines, procedures
and related operational tools (2 P-4, 1 P-3). The
Committee recommends against the disarmament
and humanitarian affairs posts (2 P-4, 1 P-3). The



7
A/56/478

functions of those posts are not well-defined and
would appear to be better placed in the substantive
departments concerned. Existing staff in the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations should be
identified to work with the technical staff in the
substantive department. The Committee believes
that the P-4 post for the Security Focal Point
Coordinator and its financing should be considered
in the context of the submission of the United
Nations Security Coordinator. The Committee will
consider the posts of the Security Coordinator at a
later stage, as indicated in paragraph 96 below. The
Committee found no justification for four proposed
General Service posts and recommends against
them. The Committee remains convinced that the
effectiveness of the Peacekeeping Best Practices
Unit depends on its ability to use information
generated from the activities of the rest of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, field
operations, other departments, agencies, funds and
programmes of the Organization, the Board of
Auditors, the Office of Internal Oversight Services
and the Joint Inspection Unit.

32. As for the public information capacity, for which
four new posts (3 Professional and 1 General Service
(Other level)) are proposed (see ibid., para. 5.12), the
Advisory Committee notes that this is the first time a
dedicated public information unit is being requested
within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
The Committee is aware of the importance of effective
public information programmes in peacekeeping
operations and the need to carefully identify and
implement those programmes on the basis of objectives
tailored to the specific needs of the missions
concerned, including adequate resources for those
programmes (see A/55/839, para. 44). The Committee
is of the opinion, however, that the Department of
Public Information should have a dedicated
technical unit to perform the functions described.
The operational activities and related programmes
should be requested in the context of each
peacekeeping mission. Accordingly, the Committee
does not agree to the establishment of this
functional capacity in the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations.

33. With respect to the gender and peacekeeping
capacity (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, paras. 5.13-5.14), the
Advisory Committee points out that there seems to be
no coherent policy in the Secretariat regarding the role

of departments and organizational units on gender
issues. The Committee has already questioned the
rationale for establishing another gender unit in the
Secretariat (see A/55/676, para. 44), stressing the need
for better collaboration and coordination with the
existing Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues
and Advancement of Women and the Division for the
Advancement of Women. The Committee is therefore
not in a position to recommend the establishment of
additional posts for this purpose (1 P-5, 1 P-3 and 1
General Service (Other level)). The Committee
urges the development of a coherent policy and, in
that context, it would consider a request for
additional resources either in the Office of the
Special Adviser on Gender Issues or elsewhere. The
Committee does recommend, however, acceptance
of the proposal to establish the additional support
account post (1 P-3) for the Resource Centre (see
A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 5.15).

Executive Office

34. In view of the considerable decentralization of
personnel actions and the delegation of authority,
the Advisory Committee does not see a need to
upgrade the post of the Executive Officer of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations to the D-1
level (see ibid., para. 5.19). Bearing in mind the six
existing General Service posts, the Committee
recommends acceptance of one out of the three
additional General Service (Other level) posts
proposed for administrative assistants within the
Office (para. 5.20).

Mine Action Service

35. The Mine Action Service is to be upgraded to
Division status, reporting directly to the Under-
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations. The
post of the Chief of Service, funded from
extrabudgetary resources, is proposed to be upgraded
to the Director level (see A/C.5/55/46, para. 16). The
Advisory Committee will deal with the upgrade of
the post of the Chief of Service when it receives the
request from the Secretary-General, in accordance
with the terms of General Assembly resolution
35/217 of 17 December 1980.

36. The Advisory Committee notes, however, that it
is proposed to establish two additional support account
posts for a planning officer at the P-4 level and a
programme officer at the P-3 level (see



8
A/56/478

A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 5.26). The Committee
agrees with the proposal to establish those two posts
in the Mine Action Service for the reasons stated.
The Committee notes that mine operation programmes
are funded from extrabudgetary resources within field
missions.

Office of Operations

37. The Advisory Committee recalls that the 12 posts
approved for the Office of Operations in the context of
General Assembly resolution 55/238 increased the
approved staffing of the Office to 71. The
establishment of an additional 13 support account posts
is now proposed (9 Professional and 4 General Service
(Other level)) (see ibid., table 5.5). The proposed posts
would be encumbered by five political affairs officers
(1 P-5, 2 P-4 and 2 P-3) (ibid., para. 5.31), one P-4 in
the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General (see
para. 25 above), four General Service (Other level)
posts in the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General
(para. 5.33) and 3 posts for the Situation Centre (1 P-4
and 2 P-3) (para. 5.35). Further assistance would be
provided through the transfer of a P-2 post from the
Office of the Assistant Secretary-General. The
Committee recommends acceptance of all of the
Professional posts requested, except for one P-3 for
the Situation Centre. The Committee recommends
against acceptance of the four General Service posts
requested in view of the existing establishment.

Office of Mission Support

38. The Advisory Committee notes that the former
Office of Logistics, Management and Mine Action is to
be reorganized and renamed the Office of Mission
Support and that the current Field Administration and
Logistics Division is being divided into two separate
divisions: the Administrative Support Division (which
will include personnel and finance) and the Logistics
Support Division. The Mine Action Service, as
indicated in paragraph 35 above, will report directly to
the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations. The core functions of the Office are to
provide direction and overall coordination of all
management, administrative and logistics support
activities for field missions, including staffing,
administration, finance and procurement and to liaise
and conduct negotiations with Member States and other
organizations regarding the administrative modalities

of their contributions to peacekeeping operations (see
ibid., para. 5.36).

39. The Advisory Committee notes that a total of 66
new support account posts (37 Professional and 29
General Service) are proposed for the Office (see ibid.,
table 5.6). The request is based on the need to
strengthen overall management at Headquarters in
order to enhance the provision of support for the field
through planning, the streamlining of policies and
procedures, the improvement of communication and
monitoring and training (ibid., para. 5.37). A total of
53 posts would be established in the Administrative
Support Division, 12 in the Logistics Support Division
and 1 (P-5) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary-
General (see para. 25 above).

40. The Advisory Committee requests that the
Office of Mission Support take the lead, on behalf
of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, in
the effort to clarify further interdepartmental
relationships and interactions as set out in
paragraph 22 above. To that end, the Committee
agrees with the establishment of a P-5 post for a
senior policy planning and analysis officer in the
Office of the Assistant Secretary-General (see ibid.,
para. 5.42, and paras. 25 and 39 above).

Administrative Support Division

41. The Administrative Support Division will
comprise the Personnel Management and Support
Service and the Finance Management and Support
Service. The Office of the Director of the Division is
proposed to have the following staff on board: a
Director at the D-2 level, an administrative
management officer at the P-4 level (see para. 25
above) and an administrative assistant (General Service
(Other level)). In view of the need to strengthen the
administrative management, planning and direction
of the Office of Mission Support, the Advisory
Committee agrees with the proposal to establish a
D-2 post for the Director of the Office and a P-4
post for the administrative management officer.
However, the function of General Service support
should be accommodated from within the Office of
Mission Support.

Personnel Management and Support Service

42. The Advisory Committee notes the intention to
strengthen the Department’s human resources function



9
A/56/478

(see ibid., paras. 5.46-5.49) and that the Personnel
Management and Support Service is to be significantly
restructured. Two new sections will be created: the
Civilian Training Section and the Human Resources
Management and Development Section. The former
Staffing Support Section and the Administration and
Information Management Section will be renamed the
Recruitment and Placement Section and the
Administration Section. A total of 37 additional posts
are requested (17 Professional and 20 General Service)
to supplement the current approved staffing of 86.

43. Personnel management and support are
critical to the success of the activities of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations both at
Headquarters and in the field. The Advisory
Committee has commented on the need to further
clarify the relationship and interaction between the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the
Office of Human Resources Management (see
paras. 22 and 40 above). The Committee regrets
that the resources that are being requested have not
been justified in terms of the results expected from
the current establishment and the proposed
additions. For example, there are approximately 4,000
applications waiting to be reviewed and processed, and
100 to 150 applications are received daily (ibid.,
para. 5.56); of the 5,688 authorized international posts
in field missions, 1,043 currently remain vacant
(para. 5.57); the Office of Mission Support currently
oversees more than 300 staff members at Headquarters
and is responsible for the management and oversight of
the support and administration of 15 peacekeeping
missions and other field offices with approximately
60,000 military, civilian police and civilian personnel
and $2.9 billion in financial resources (para. 5.40); and
the number of field staff has nearly doubled from 2,428
on board in November 1999 to 4,645 as at June 2001
(para. 5.61).

44. The question that remains to be asked,
however, is how these raw numbers can be related
to current authorized capacity and to the additional
requests for staff and non-staff costs. What effect
will the additional resources have, for example, in
addressing the 4,000 applications waiting to be
processed or the 150 daily applications? The
Advisory Committee believes that it is the duty of
the Office of Mission Support and of the rest of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations to provide
that analysis in order to justify additional funding.

As indicated in paragraphs 9 and 10 above, the
Committee requests that the Department, in future,
change the way in which it presents and justifies
resource needs.

45. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee believes
that, unless current procedures are changed and
efficiencies are introduced in the whole range of
personnel management and administration, the
mere addition of posts would be futile. In this
connection, the Committee draws attention to its
comments in paragraphs VIII.27 to 29 of its first
report on the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2002-2003.3 The Committee welcomes the
emphasis on training, planning, the establishment of
rosters (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, paras. 5.47-5.48)
and the development of the Galaxy system, which
would provide capacity to manage and monitor
personnel actions in the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Human
Resources Management (see para. 98 (a) of the
Committee’s report on the proposed programme
budget). The Committee expects increased
efficiency gains and productivity once the system
and related rosters become fully operational.
Attention must be drawn, however, to the comments
made by the Committee on training in its report on
the financing of United Nations peacekeeping
operations (A/55/874, para. 57).

46. Taking into account its comments in
paragraphs 44 and 45 above, and bearing in mind
the need to address the current backlog and
bottlenecks in personnel actions, the Advisory
Committee recommends approval of 16 additional
Professional posts and 13 General Service posts for
a total of 29 out of 37 requested by the Secretary-
General. If the General Assembly approves this
recommendation, the total number of posts
available for the Service would therefore be 115 (see
para. 42 above). The Committee expects that
progress will be made in addressing the bottlenecks
and backlog and that close attention will be paid to
this area in the assessment called for in paragraph
66 below. In the meantime, the Committee requests
that it be provided with a schedule for eliminating
backlogs in recruitment in the context of the report
on the support account to be presented in the winter
of 2002.



10

A/56/478

Finance Management and Support Service

47. The Advisory Committee notes that no structural
changes are proposed for the Finance Management and
Support Service but that additional staffing resources
are requested to strengthen financial management and
support functions for almost 30 field missions and 17
trust funds, 13 missions under liquidation and claims
management. A total of 13 additional posts are
proposed (7 Professional and 6 General Service (Other
level)).

48. A P-4 post is requested for a management review
officer in the Office of the Chief of Service (see
A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 5.70). In view of the
considerable management capacity being given to
the Department (see para. 28 above), the Advisory
Committee recommends against the establishment
of this post.

49. The Financial Support Section is proposed to be
strengthened with a P-3 post for a finance officer in
view of the number of peacekeeping operations in
Africa; two General Service (Other level) posts for
finance assistant functions to strengthen resources
dedicated to Asia and the Middle East and to
liquidation tasks; and one General Service (Other
level) post for a registry clerk (see ibid., para. 5.76).
The Claims and Information Management Section is
proposed to be strengthened in the area of claims, with
four additional P-3 posts and one General Service
(Other level) post, and in the area of information
management, where an additional P-2 post and two
General Service (Other level) posts are proposed. The
Advisory Committee draws attention to its
comments on the need to strengthen the liquidation
capacity at Headquarters (A/55/874, paras. 51-54).
In view of the priority assigned to claims-processing
and liquidation as well as existing bottlenecks, the
Committee agrees with the proposals of the
Secretary-General to add six Professional and five
General Service posts in the Finance Management
and Support Service. If this recommendation is
approved by the General Assembly, total staff
resources in the Finance Management and Support
Service will be 70 posts (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1,
para. 5.69).

50. The Advisory Committee notes the comments
made in paragraph 5.65 of the addendum to the
Secretary-General’s statement. The Committee
requests that information be provided on measures

to be introduced to provide greater flexibility in the
management of budgets in the field. This
information should be provided in the next support
account budget (winter 2002). Information should
also be provided on progress achieved in the
management of the claims process.

Logistics Support Division

51. The Advisory Committee notes that the former
Logistics and Communications Service is being
upgraded and renamed the Logistics Support Division
and that an additional 12 posts are requested (10
Professional and 2 General Service) to supplement the
current approved staffing of 147, in addition to the
redeployment of the 8 posts currently approved for the
Office of the Director of the Field Administration and
Logistics Division (see ibid., para. 5.83). For a
summary of the reorganized structure of the Division,
see A/C.5/55/46, paragraph 22.

52. An additional P-4 post is proposed to be
established in the Office of the Deputy Director for a
review and analysis officer in the Logistics Policy and
Plans Section (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 5.90). The
Advisory Committee agrees with this proposal. The
Communications and Information Technology Service
is responsible for the global peacekeeping
communications and information technology network
at Headquarters and in the field. The Committee further
notes that the Service (which has been upgraded from
section status) would grow from 34 to an authorized
strength of 42 through the establishment of three new
posts (1 P-5 and 2 P-4) and the redeployment of four
posts (ibid., paras. 5.93 and 5.94). The Committee
agrees with the proposal for the P-5 in paragraph
5.94 (a) and the P-4 in paragraph 5.94 (c). The
Committee is not in favour of the P-4 requested in
paragraph 5.94 (b); this function should be carried
out by the Department of Public Information.

53. The Advisory Committee also notes the
establishment of a new entity, the Material and
Contract Management Service, through the
amalgamation of a number of functions previously
diffused over several sections (see ibid., paras. 5.95-
5.97. Two administrative assistant posts (General
Service (Other level)) are requested for the Service.
Based on the testimony of representatives of the
Secretary-General, the Committee concluded that
virtually no interdepartmental discussions had taken
place on the establishment of the new Service. The



11

A/56/478

Committee trusts that the new service will work
closely with the Department of Management to
benefit from expertise currently available and best
practices as developed by the Procurement Division.
With this caveat, the Committee agrees with the
proposal for the two additional General Service
posts.

54. The Advisory Committee notes that the former
Engineering Section is being transformed into a service
in view of the increasing scope of the technical and
administrative tasks it performs (see ibid., para. 5.98),
and that three additional posts are being requested. A
Professional post at the P-4 level is being requested for
the Chief of the Plans and Operations Section. In
addition, a P-3 post is being requested for the
Geographic Information System Unit, and another P-3
post is being requested for the functions of a civil
engineer in the Plans and Implementation Unit
(para. 5.100).

55. With regard to the post for the Geographic
Information System Unit, the Advisory Committee
recalls its comments made in the context of its report
on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (see
A/55/839, paras. 58-60). The Committee further recalls
that, in its report on the implementation of the report of
the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, it had
recommended the establishment of a P-4 post for a
number of functions, including those related to
geographic information systems (GIS) (see A/55/676,
para. 56). Moreover, the Committee notes that a total of
18 posts are currently approved in connection with the
GIS pilot project in the United Nations Organization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(1 P-3, 2 Field Service (Other level) and 2 Local level),
the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea
(1 P-3, 2 Field Service (Other level), 1 Local level and
3 United Nations Volunteers) and the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone (1 P-3, 5 Local level). The
Committee is therefore not convinced of the need to
establish either the unit or this post before the pilot
project is finished and a report is submitted to the
General Assembly on the subject. The Committee
recommends acceptance of the P-4 post requested in
paragraph 5.100 (a) and the P-3 post requested in
paragraph 5.100 (c).

56. Three additional posts are proposed for the
Transport Service in view of the growth in the scope
and complexity of the tasks performed by this entity. A
D-1 post is proposed for the Chief of the

Transportation Service, along with a P-5 post for the
Chief of the Air Transport Section and a P-3 post for a
movement control officer (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1,
para. 5.107). The Advisory Committee recommends
acceptance of the proposals for the P-5 and P-3
posts. However, it is not fully convinced of the need
for a D-1 post. Justification for this post must be
analysed in the context of the overall structure of
the Division. The chiefs of the four services should
continue to be at the P-5 level, and the upgrading of
heads to the Director level, whether through
redeployment or through the creation of additional
posts, should be reviewed, taking fully into account
the need to avoid duplication of functions with
other entities of the Secretariat. Such requests
should be resubmitted in the context of the next
support account proposal.

Military Division

57. An additional 13 support account posts (10
Professional and 3 General Service (Other level)) are
proposed to be established in the Military Division,
which is in transition to its new structure (see ibid.,
table 5.7 and para. 5.109). An additional P-3 post for a
peacekeeping affairs officer is requested for the Office
of the Military Adviser, which would be occupied by a
civilian, to coordinate with the Director of
Management (see paras. 25 and 28 above). Four P-4
posts and one General Service (Other level) post are
requested for the Current Military Operations Service,
one of which would also be occupied by a civilian with
relevant military experience. An additional P-4 post for
a planning officer (a civilian with relevant military
expertise) and a General Service (Other level) post are
requested for the Force Generation and Military
Personnel Service. The Training and Evaluation
Service, which currently has 15 posts (11 Professional
and 4 General Service), is also proposed to be
strengthened by the addition of two P-4, two P-3 and
one General Service (Other level) post (see ibid.,
paras. 5.115-5.122). The Advisory Committee
recommends acceptance of the proposals for the
Military Division.

Civilian Police Division

58. The Secretary-General is proposing to strengthen
the Civilian Police Division through the addition of 8
new support account posts (7 Professional and 1
General Service (Other level)) over and above the



12

A/56/478

current authorized strength of 17. A P-4 post is
included for a special assistant to the Adviser, the post
of which would be reclassified at the D-2 level. One
P-4 and two P-3 posts would be added to the Policy
and Planning Section; and one General Service (Other
level) post would be added to the Mission Management
Section for an administrative assistant (see ibid.,
paras. 5.129-5.131). The Advisory Committee
recommends acceptance of these posts. A new unit,
the Criminal Law and Judicial Advisory Unit, is
proposed to provide advice on criminal law and
judicial issues, with staffing by two judicial officers (1
P-4 and 1 P-3) and a corrections officer (P-4) (ibid.,
para. 5.132). The Committee notes that the functions
of the two judicial officers are broadly similar. At
this stage, the Committee recommends acceptance
of the posts proposed in subparagraphs 5.132 (a)
and (c). Should the need arise, additional resources
can be requested, on the basis of workload
justification, in the next support account budget
(see also paras. 10 and 14 above).

Non-post resources

59. A total amount of $6,341,700 is included for non-
post resources under the support account for the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (see
A/C.5/55/46, para. 24).

60. As for the provision of $100,000 (see
A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 5.133), the Advisory
Committee agrees with the request. However, the
Committee expects that such requirements will
decrease in the next budget as a result of the
additional posts authorized under resolution 55/238,
which should be fully on board and the recruitment
of additional posts authorized as a result of the
current request.

61. Requirements indicated for supplies and
materials, communications and subscriptions (see
ibid., paras. 5.134, 5.137 and 5.140) should be
absorbed. Furthermore, the amounts proposed for
office furniture and equipment ($533,600),
maintenance of office automation equipment
($77,400) and data-processing equipment
($3,459,800) (ibid., paras. 5.135, 5.138 and 5.139)
should be prorated to the level of staff approved,
resulting in a reduction of $421,000. The Committee
requests a review of the estimates for maintenance
of equipment and unit prices for data-processing
equipment, as they seem very high.

62. As for the provision for $230,000 under
consultants and experts for the continued use of
external experts by the Peacekeeping Best Practices
Unit to supplement in-house knowledge in the
development of policy documents (ibid., para. 5.141),
the Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry,
that a total of $300,000 had been approved in the
context of the requirements for the implementation of
the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace
Operations (A/55/507 and Add.1) for that purpose. The
current proposal is therefore a request to carry over the
unspent portion of those funds. The resources would be
used to fund studies into elements of the Strategic
Manual for Multidimensional Peacekeeping
Operations. The Committee agrees with this
proposal.

63. With respect to the request for $1,026,000 for the
use of consultants for a number of projects (see
A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 5.142). The Advisory
Committee does not recommend approval of the
resources proposed under subparagraphs 5.142 (b),
(c) and (d) in view of the additional staff
recommended for approval.

64. The Advisory Committee notes that a provision
of $422,000 is made for training (see ibid.,
para. 5.143). The Committee recalls that resources
provided under the support account for the period from
1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 amounted to $880,500.
The comments of the Committee in this regard are
contained in its report on the support account budget
for 2001/02 (A/55/882, paras. 16-19). The Committee
also commented on the considerable resources
available for training within individual peacekeeping
operation budgets for all missions in its report on the
financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations
(A/55/874, para. 57). For example, in 2000/01 (the last
period for which complete data are available), training
in peacekeeping operation budgets totalled nearly $1.5
million. In the opinion of the Committee, a case has
not been made at this time for additional resources.
The totality of the resources requested for training
should be justified in the context of the next
submission of the support account budget. Under
the circumstances, the Committee recommends
against the additional $422,000.

65. Taking into account the recommendations
regarding the additional staff, the Advisory
Committee recommends that the total estimate of



13

A/56/478

$6,341,700 for non-staff costs (see para. 59 above)
be reduced to $4,549,000.

66. In view of the extensive restructuring of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the
significant increases recommended by the Advisory
Committee for staff and other resources, the
Committee recommends that the effect of such
changes as may be approved by the General
Assembly be assessed after a period of time (i.e., by
2004) in order to ensure that what has been
implemented continues, in both size and structure,
to represent the most appropriate response to the
peacekeeping needs of the United Nations.

Section 22
Human rights

67. The Secretary-General is proposing a total
increase in resources of $2,839,300 under this section.
Of that amount, $1,890,300 is requested under the
regular budget and $949,000 is sought under the
support account. The additional resources under the
regular budget, over and above the $42,060,300
included under section 22 of the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 2002-2003, comprise an
amount of $630,400 net for the establishment of six
new posts (5 Professional and 1 General Service) and
$1,259,900 for non-post requirements.

68. Resources proposed under the support account
would comprise $523,600 gross ($422,900 net) for the
establishment of nine temporary posts under the
support account (6 Professional and 3 General Service)
and $425,400 for non-post requirements for the period
from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002. The total number of
15 posts requested would be established at the Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights in Geneva. The Committee points out that, until
now, no resources have been proposed under the
support account for the Office of the High
Commissioner. Hitherto, human resources for human
rights-related functions in peacekeeping have been
included in the budgets of each peacekeeping
operation, funded from the regular budget,
peacekeeping budgets or extrabudgetary resources. An
amount of $16,531,872 and 184 posts are related to
human rights components in seven peacekeeping
operations indicated therein for the period from 1 July
2000 to 30 June 2001 (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, table
22.3). Upon further enquiry, the Committee was

provided with the information shown in annex III to the
present report.

69. The Advisory Committee found that the
rationale for requesting some posts under the
support account and some under the regular budget
was not clear from the justification contained in the
Secretary-General’s statement of programme
budget implications; neither was it apparent from
the testimony of the representatives of the
Secretary-General and the High Commissioner. The
Committee points out that the inclusion of resources
in the support account presupposes that support by
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human
Rights would decline or increase depending on the
level of peacekeeping operations in the field. The
Committee points out, however, that promoting
human rights in an area covered by a peacekeeping
mission does not necessarily end or decline when the
mandate of the mission concerned is terminated.

70. The Advisory Committee has therefore treated
the request as a whole. Bearing in mind its
comments in the preceding paragraph, the
Committee has concluded that the Activities and
Programmes Branch is an area where additional
surge capacity resources, directly related to training
and coordination of human rights components of
peacekeeping operations, are required. Accordingly,
the Committee recommends the approval of an
additional P-4, two P-3 and one General Service
post for this branch to be financed from the regular
budget.

71. The Advisory Committee will follow up on the
way in which those resources are utilized, and
information should be provided by the Secretary-
General in the context of the performance report on
the support account to be presented to the
Committee in February 2003. Moreover, should any
future requests be forthcoming related to the
human rights component of peacekeeping
operations, they should be formulated in a way that
addresses the shortcomings referred to in
paragraph 69 above. The Committee should also be
provided with information on how the resources of
the New York Liaison Office could be utilized for
interaction with the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations.



14

A/56/478

Non-post requirements

72. The non-post requirements total $1,685,300
(A/C.5/55/46, paras. 35-36). The Advisory
Committee recommends the approval of an amount
of $500,000 under the regular budget for the most
pressing needs (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, paras. 22.29-
22.40).

Section 27
Management and central support
services

73. The Advisory Committee notes that the
Secretary-General is proposing to strengthen the
Department of Management to provide backstopping
support for the current level of peacekeeping
operations in the areas of procurement, peacekeeping
budgeting, peacekeeping accounts, cash management
and treasury services, contributions services, human
resources management, medical services,
communications networks, security services and
property disposal (see ibid., para. 27.1).

74. Total additional resources of $6,802,800 are
requested (ibid., table 27.1). Of this total, additional
resources for the support account for the period from 1
July 2001 to 30 June 2002 are estimated at $6,674,900
gross ($6,353,300 net), comprising $1,888,000 gross
($1,566,400 net) for 61 new posts (25 Professional, 33
General Service (10 Principal level and 23 Other level)
and 3 Security Service), and $4,786,900 for non-post
requirements, including common service costs for 207
posts (see A/C.5/55/46, para. 31).

75. The Advisory Committee notes the statement that
there is a shared division of labour with the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the
administrative areas and that efforts have been made to
delegate authority, responsibility and corresponding
accountability to the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations and to the field. However, in spite of such
delegations, the Departments of Management and of
Peacekeeping Operations had jointly identified around
200 administrative functions directly attributable to
Headquarters support to the field (A/C.5/55/46/Add.1,
para. 27.1).

76. In this connection, the Advisory Committee
draws attention to its comments in paragraph 22
above. The Committee requests that the

Department of Management, in future, justify
current and additional resources requested in the
manner described by the Committee in paragraphs
9 and 10 above. In addition, the Committee urges
both departments to jointly adopt strong and
effective measures to build capacity in field missions
for further delegation of authority in financial and
personnel transactions and management. The
Committee does not expect to be given the excuse
that there is a lack of technical management
expertise in the field and an absence of requisite
information systems to manage and monitor
delegated authority, as has been done in the past.

Office of the Under-Secretary-General for
Management

77. Four new support account posts are proposed in
the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for
Management: a P-4 post for a finance officer and a
General Service post for a finance assistant in the
Treasury Division; a General Service post for a
contributions clerk in the Contributions Service; and a
General Service post for an administrative assistant in
the Executive Office (see ibid., paras. 27.4-27.6). The
Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the
post for the Finance Officer (P-4) and the General
Service post in the Treasury Division, but not of the
General Service post for an administrative assistant
in the Executive Office. The Committee was
satisfied with the explanations provided as to the
need for the post requested in the Contributions
Service and therefore recommends its approval. The
Committee also recommends that proposals be
made on how to improve the work of this Service,
using modern technology, to address the difficulties
identified in paragraph 27.3 of the statement.

Office of Programme Planning, Budget
and Accounts

78. A total of 18 posts are requested under the
support account for the Office of Programme Planning,
Budget and Accounts (see ibid., table 27.4). Of this
total, 14 posts, including 3 Professional (2 P-4 and 1
P-3) and 11 General Service (2 Principal level and 9
Other level) are to strengthen the Accounts Division.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance
of a P-3 post and a General Service post for a
finance officer and a principal accounting assistant
to perform functions related to the liquidation of

missions (ibid., para. 27.13 (a) and (b)). In view of
the difficulties reported concerning timely
settlement of payroll transactions for peacekeeping
personnel, the Committee agrees with the approval
of three of the four General Service posts indicated
in paragraph 27.16 (a) and (b) of the statement. The
Committee also agrees to the provision of the
General Service post for an accounting assistant in
the Vendor Claims Unit (para. 27.19 (b)) to address
apparent delays in processing vendor claims. The
Committee also recommends approval of the P-4
post for a finance officer in the Insurance Service
(para. 27.22) for risk management and commercial
insurance issues, and of the General Service post for
an administrative assistant in relation to the work
of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims
(para. 27.23).

79. The Peacekeeping Financing Division is also
proposed to be strengthened with the addition of four
support account posts (3 P-3 and 1 General Service
(Other level)) to carry out the functions of budget
officers and a budget assistant (para. 27.27). The
Advisory Committee recommends approval of the
establishment of two of the three proposed P-3
posts. The Committee does not recommend
approval of the additional General Service post.

Office of Human Resources Management

80. The Office of Human Resources Management is
proposed to be strengthened with the establishment of
16 support account posts (11 Professional and 5
General Service (Other level)) (see ibid., table 27.5).
The current staffing establishment consists of 169
regular budget posts (75 Professional and 94 General
Service) and 11 support account posts (5 Professional
and 6 General Service). In examining this request,
the Advisory Committee took into consideration the
fact that the implementation of the Secretary-
General’s proposal on human resources
management, as approved by the General Assembly
in its resolution 55/258, would begin — as indicated
by the representatives of the Secretary-General —
in January 2002. Among other effects, these reform
proposals would empower programme managers to
take more personnel decisions. However, the
Committee draws attention to its comments and
recommendations made in paragraphs VIII.20 to
VIII.35 of its first report on the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.3

81. A P-4 legal officer is requested to provide advice
on human resource policies and rules to mission staff
(ibid., para. 27.29). The Advisory Committee
recommends acceptance of this request. With
regard to the three posts (1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 General
Service) requested for the Operational Services
Division to perform the full range of personnel
functions, including recruitment, placement and so
on (para. 27.31), the Committee is of the view that
those functions should be carried out by existing
staff in the Office of Human Resources
Management in view of the comments of the
Committee in paragraphs 22 and 45 above. The
Committee agrees, however, with the need to
strengthen the Division with the addition of the
three new proposed posts (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 1
General Service) (para. 27.32) to begin the process
of equipping the Office with the capacity to monitor
the delegation of authority. The Committee also
notes the proposed establishment in the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations of a P-3 post to monitor
delegation of authority (para. 5.51), and requests
close coordination between the two departments on
this question. This post could be dispensed with in
future, relying on the capacity of the Office of
Human Resources Management to monitor
delegation of authority.

82. In this connection, however, the Advisory
Committee notes that the Secretary-General is
preparing a report on delegation of authority and
accountability in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 55/258. The Committee requests that the
report also address the concerns of the Advisory
Committee, as set out in paragraphs VIII.27 and
VIII.28 of its report on the budget.3

83. The Advisory Committee also agrees with the
proposal to establish a P-4 post for a compensation
policy officer and the two posts (1 P-4 and 1
General Service (Other level)) for a legal officer and
a legal assistant for the Administrative Law Unit
(ibid., paras. 27.35 and 27.38).

84. In the view of the Advisory Committee, the
functions of the posts of the Staff Development Officer
and the Staff Counsellor (1 P-4 and 1 P-3)
(paras. 27.39 and 27.44), appear to duplicate activities
already proposed in the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, in particular those assigned to the
Administrative Division. The Committee believes that
this is an area that requires further clarification of the



16

A/56/478

role of both departments, particularly in relation to
non-field staff under the purview of the Office of
Human Resources Management and field staff under
the purview of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations. In paragraph 43 above, mention is made of
the 300 staff overseen by the Office of Mission Support
at Headquarters. Accordingly, the Committee does
not recommend approval of these additional posts,
whose functions should continue to be performed by
current staff in close cooperation with the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

85. The Advisory Committee also does not see the
need for the four additional staff proposed under
the Medical Services Division (1 D-1, 1 P-4 and 2
General Service). The Committee is not convinced
that there is sufficient justification for a second D-1
post for a Medical Director. Additional information
supplied to the Committee has led it to conclude
that the increase in workload is not substantial
enough to warrant the proposed additional P-4 and
General Service posts.

Office of Central Support Services

86. An additional 23 support account posts are
requested for the Office of Central Support Services (7
Professional, 13 General Service and 3 Security
Service) (ibid., table 27.6). The Committee notes that
the current authorized staffing of 680 comprises 648
regular budget posts and 32 support account posts.

87. Three of the additional posts are requested for the
Security and Safety Service (1 P-3, 1 P-2 and 1
Security Service) to strengthen the Training Unit and to
provide comprehensive central training for security
officers seconded or appointed to new or expanded
peacekeeping missions (para. 27.54). Two additional
security officers are proposed for assignment to the
new office facilities at Headquarters. The Advisory
Committee recommends acceptance of this
proposal.

88. A Professional post at the P-2 level and eight
General Service posts (7 at the Principal level) are
requested for the Information Technology Services
Division (paras. 27.58-27.59). The Advisory
Committee does not recommend acceptance of this
proposal in view of the existing resources.

89. The Advisory Committee recommends against
the proposal to establish four new support account
posts (1 P-5, 2 P-3, 1 General Service) in the

Procurement Division (para. 27.63), taking into
account the comments made in paragraph 53 above
and the need for better coordination between the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the
Department of Management. Similarly, the
Committee recommends against the P-4 post in the
Archives and Records Management Section of the
Office of Conference and Support Services
(para. 27.64) and three General Service posts in the
Mail Operations Unit (para. 27.68). The Committee
recommends acceptance of the General Service post
in the Travel and Transportation Service
(para. 27.66).

Non-post requirements

90. The non-post requirements for section 27 under
the regular budget amount to $127,900 for the
biennium 2002-2003 to cover the rental of premises
and provision of accommodation for three new posts in
New York mentioned in paragraph 17 above (see ibid.,
paras. 27.69-27.77). In view of the recommendation
made in paragraph 19 above, the Advisory
Committee recommends acceptance of the amount
requested.

91. As for the non-post requirements under the
support account of $4,786,900 proposed under section
27, the Advisory Committee notes that a large part
($3,671,800) represents the cost of the rental of
premises and accommodations for the 207 new posts
proposed, in addition to infrastructure costs of the
central services estimated on the basis of average rates
and standard costs per post (para. 27.75). In this regard,
the Committee recalls its comments and observations
made in the context of its report on the budget for the
support account for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30
June 2002 (A/55/882, para. 25) and paragraph VIII.78
of its first report on the proposed programme budget
for the biennium 2002-2003.3

92. In view of the recommendations of the
Advisory Committee stated above, the Committee
recommends a reduction of the proposed amount
for non-staff costs of the support account for
peacekeeping operations of $1,621,150.



17

A/56/478

Section 28
Internal oversight

93. Additional resources of $279,500 gross are
requested under the support account for section 28,
comprising $147,200 for the establishment of four new
posts (1 D-1, 1 P-5 and 2 General Service (Other
level)) and $132,300 for non-post requirements (see
A/C.5/55/46, para. 39, and A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, table
28.1).

94. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the request to establish a D-1 post for a
Chief of the Peacekeeping Audit Service in the
Audit Division and the General Service post to
provide administrative support. The Committee was
further informed that the D-1 post would also serve
to strengthen the resident audit service by
coordinating the activities of the 18 resident
auditors in peacekeeping operations. In this
connection, the Committee requests the Under-
Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services
to refine the procedure currently in place to handle,
both in the field missions and at Headquarters, the
reports and observations of the resident auditors.
The Committee is of the opinion that guidelines
should be in place to ensure that the performance
and independence of resident auditors are not
adversely affected by any reporting on or review of
their work and functions by either the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, the Chief
Administrative Officer or the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations.

95. The Advisory Committee also recommends
acceptance of the proposal to establish a P-5 post
for a senior investigator and a General Service post
for an information assistant in the Investigations
Division (A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 28.4). The
Committee urges that steps be taken to fill all 12
posts for resident investigators in peacekeeping
missions.

Section 30
Special expenses

96. Additional support account resources estimated at
$191,500 gross are indicated for the Office of the
United Nations Security Coordinator, comprising
$129,100 gross for the establishment of four new posts

(2 P-4 and 2 General Service (Other level)) and
$62,400 for non-post requirements. The Advisory
Committee will revert to this matter in the context
of its examination of the report of the Secretary-
General on inter-organizational security measures
to be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-
sixth session, as indicated in paragraph X.19 of the
Committee’s first report on the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.3

Section 32
Staff assessment

97. In view of the recommendations of the
Advisory Committee made in the present report, the
amount for staff assessment would be reduced by
$66,600, to $182,600. This will be offset by a
corresponding amount under income section 1.

IV. Conclusion

98. Taking into account its observations in the
present report, the Advisory Committee
recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the
General Assembly that, should it adopt the draft
resolution contained in document A/C.4/55/L.23,
additional requirements of $1,575,700 will arise
under the following expenditure sections of the
proposed programme budget for the biennium
2003-2003:

Section 3: $376,400

Section 22: $888,800

Section 27D: $127,900

Section 32: $182,600

Additional requirements of $16,215,450 will also
arise under the support account for the period from
1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002.

99. The Advisory Committee has recommended
approval of 7 additional posts under the regular
budget (3 under section 3, Political affairs, and 4
under section 22, Human rights) and 122 additional
posts under the support account (92 under section
5, Peacekeeping operations; 26 under section 27,
Management and central support services; and 4
under section 28, Internal oversight).



18

A/56/478

100. The Advisory Committee was informed that it
was the intention of the Secretary-General, based
on such decision as the General Assembly might
take regarding additional resources under the
support account for peacekeeping operations, to
prorate the financing of the additional support
account resources approved among the upcoming
revised financing resolutions for the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone, the United Nations Mission
in Ethiopia and Eritrea, the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
Congo and the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor, whose updated
budgets will be considered during the current
session of the Assembly.
