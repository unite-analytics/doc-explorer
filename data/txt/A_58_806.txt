Fifty-eighth session
Agenda item 167
Financing of the United Nations Operation
in Côte d’Ivoire

Proposed budget for the period from 4 April 2004
to 30 June 2005 of the United Nations Operation
in Côte d’Ivoire

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $502,354,400

Recommendation of the Advisory Committee $297,014,700

I. Introduction

1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee contained in
paragraphs 21, 25, 28, 30, 32, 42 and 45 below would entail a reduction of
$205,339,700 in the proposed budget for the United Nations Operation in Côte
d’Ivoire (UNOCI) for the period from 4 April 2004 to 30 June 2005 (A/58/788).
The Committee also makes a number of observations and recommendations
with regard to the administration and management of the mission and
opportunities for further savings, and recommends that, pending the
presentation of a revised budget in the autumn of 2004, provision be made only
for the periods from 4 April to 30 June 2004, and from 1 July to 31 December
2004 (see paras. 44 and 45 below).

2. The views and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on a number
of cross-cutting issues are set out in its general report on administrative and
budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping
operations (A/58/759). Consequently, in the paragraphs below, the Committee
deals with resources and other items that relate specifically to UNOCI.

A/58/806

3. By its resolution 1528 (2004) of 27 February 2004, the Security Council
established UNOCI for an initial period of 12 months as from 4 April 2004 and
requested the Secretary-General to transfer authority from the United Nations
Mission in Côte d’Ivoire (MINUCI) and the forces of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) to UNOCI on that date. The Council also decided
that UNOCI would comprise, in addition to the appropriate civilian, judiciary and
corrections component, a military strength of a maximum of 6,240 United Nations
personnel, including 200 military observers and 120 staff officers, and up to 350
civilian police officers.

4. By a letter dated 24 March 2004 (see annex I), the Chairman of the Advisory
Committee communicated to the Secretary-General the Committee’s concurrence,
pursuant to section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December
1994, with the request to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed
$49,943,300 gross to meet the cost of initial critical logistical and personnel
requirements of the Operation for the period ending 30 June 2004, on the
understanding that the full budget for the 2003/04 and 2004/05 periods would be
submitted to the General Assembly at the second part of its resumed fifty-eighth
session.

5. The proposed budget for UNOCI (A/58/788) takes into account the personnel
and assets of MINUCI and contains estimates for the 15-month period from 4 April
2004 to 30 June 2005.

6. The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the
financing of UNOCI are listed at the end of the present report.

II. Expenditure and incumbency data for the period
from 24 March to 30 June 2004

7. The Advisory Committee was provided with expenditure data for the period
from 24 March to 30 June 2004 as at 10 May 2004 (see annex II). Expenditure for
the period amounted to $27,350,500 against a commitment authority of $49,943,300.
The Committee was also informed that, as at 11 May 2004, the incumbency of
UNOCI was as follows:

Category Authorized Encumbered

Vacancy/delayed
deployment rate

III. Proposed budget for the period from 4 April 2004
to 30 June 2005

A. Mandate and planned results

8. The Advisory Committee commends the Secretariat for the well-defined
results-based framework it has established for the Operation. The Committee also
notes that, in line with the recommendation contained in its general report on
peacekeeping operations (A/58/759), an effort has been made to present more
clearly mission-specific objectives. Furthermore, the components and expected
accomplishments have been closely aligned with the mandate of the mission, as set
out in Security Council resolution 1528 (2004).

Disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement

9. The Advisory Committee was informed that the cost of implementing the
Government of National Reconciliation’s programme to disarm, demobilize and,
where applicable, repatriate approximately 30,000 ex-combatants was estimated at
approximately $105 million. The costs are to be met from external funding, which
so far has involved the Government of Côte d’Ivoire, the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund and the
World Bank. Upon request, the Committee was provided with details concerning the
funding of the programme (see annex III). As indicated in paragraphs 53 to 55 of the
proposed budget, the mission intends to set up a Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration Section to assist the Government in the implementation of the
programme.

10. Upon enquiry as to the accuracy of the estimate of ex-combatants, the
Committee was informed that the Government had a registry of combatants, most of
whom were former members of the Government armed forces; however, no accurate
account is available with regard to foreign combatants.

11. The Advisory Committee was also informed, upon enquiry, that at present
there was no time frame for implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programme, but 11 sites had been identified and 2 had been prepared.
The Advisory Committee strongly recommends that a time frame for
implementation be established as soon as possible.

Regional cooperation

12. In paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 1528 (2004), the Security Council
requested the Secretary-General to encourage the United Nations missions in West
Africa to share logistical and administrative support in order to maximize
effectiveness and minimize the cost of the missions, and requested UNOCI to carry
out its mandate in close liaison with the United Nations missions in Sierra Leone
and Liberia, especially in the prevention of movements of arms and combatants
across shared borders and the implementation of disarmament and demobilization
programmes. In this connection, the Advisory Committee takes note of the report of
the Secretary-General of 12 March 2004 on ways to combat subregional and cross-
border problems in West Africa (S/2004/200).

A/58/806

13. The Advisory Committee was briefed on the extent to which cooperation had
already been established. It was informed that the missions were actively discussing
modalities for cooperation and that regional force commanders met once a month.
Among other things, agreement had been reached between UNOCI and the United
Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for joint border patrols, and those two
missions, along with the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), were
working to formulate joint plans for more effective border control. Furthermore, a
plan had been agreed upon whereby each of the missions would have a military
observer stationed in the other missions as liaison officer. The Committee was
informed that the high-level meetings of the Special Representatives of the
Secretary-General and heads of United Nations missions in West Africa constituted
the forum for the formulation of policy recommendations and the development of
strategies to enhance the regional approach in addressing transnational problems.
The Committee welcomes the steps taken thus far to promote regional cooperation;
however it is the impression of the Committee that not all countries in the region are
involved in this process.

14.  The Advisory Committee was informed that there had also been cooperation
among the missions in the sharing of logistical resources, such as vehicles,
information technology equipment and air assets, as well as rations and medication.
The Committee was informed, for example, that the estimates for UNOCI had not
provided for a heavy-lift helicopter, as it had been determined that there was
sufficient capacity in the region, and UNMIL had provided such heavy-lift
helicopter capability to UNOCI when needed. Upon request, the Committee was
provided with detailed information on logistical cooperation between the missions
(see annex IV).

15. The Advisory Committee was also informed that the mission intended to work
closely with ECOWAS on operational, political and electoral assistance issues.
ECOWAS is invited to participate in the high-level meetings of Special
Representatives, and a representative of ECOWAS participates in the Monitoring
Committee established by the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, which is chaired by the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for UNOCI.

Integrated nature of the Operation

16. UNOCI is to be an integrated mission, having close cooperation with the other
United Nations entities in the country. In paragraph 5 of its resolution 1528 (2004),
the Security Council reaffirmed its strong support for the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General and approved his full authority for the coordination and
conduct of all the activities of the United Nations system in Côte d’Ivoire. The
integrated nature of the Operation is reflected in its proposed organizational
structure, with one of the Deputy Special Representatives serving as coordinator of
all humanitarian and economic activities of the United Nations system in Côte
d’Ivoire, as well as of non-governmental organizations (see also paras. 27 and 28
below). The large number of United Nations agencies and non-governmental
organizations present in the country make this approach particularly important.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the Special Representative chaired
biweekly meetings to coordinate activities of the United Nations agencies and
programmes and that a representative of the Office of the Special Representative
participated in weekly inter-agency meetings chaired by UNDP or the Office for the



5
A/58/806

Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs focusing on humanitarian and development
issues.

B. Resource requirements

1. Military and police personnel

Categorya Authorized/proposed

Military observers 200

Military contingents 6 040

Civilian police 350

a Represents the highest level of authorized or proposed strength.

17. The estimate of $10,741,900 for military observers for the 15-month period is
based on the phased deployment of 124 military observers by July 2004 and
includes 76 military liaison officers transferred from MINUCI, for a total authorized
strength of 200 observers. A 10 per cent delayed deployment factor has been applied
for mission subsistence allowance.

18. With respect to military contingent personnel, the estimated requirement of
$178,210,800 for the 15-month period takes into account the transfer on 4 April
2004 of 1,608 troops from ECOWAS, with the full deployment of 6,040 troops to be
attained in August 2004. A 5 per cent delayed deployment factor has been applied
for contingent personnel. With regard to the transfer of the ECOWAS troops, the
Advisory Committee was informed that an agreement had been reached that
contractual arrangements for the supply of equipment, rations and fuel that were in
place before the troops were transferred would continue until early June 2004. The
Committee was also informed that medical support was needed.

19. The estimated requirements for civilian police for the 15-month period amount
to $17,955,100 and are based on a phased deployment, with the authorized strength
of 350 personnel to be attained in September 2004. A 20 per cent delayed
deployment factor has been applied in respect of mission subsistence allowance.

20. The Advisory Committee was informed that the status-of-forces agreement
was being finalized and would be signed within days. The Committee welcomes
the expeditiousness with which the agreement was achieved.

21. However, information provided to the Advisory Committee upon request
indicated that the status of negotiation of memorandums of understanding with
troop-contributing countries was not as encouraging, with 10 under negotiation, 12
to be negotiated and none yet signed. The Committee believes that this delay could
significantly affect deployment. In view of this situation, as well as the current
delayed deployment rates for military personnel (38 per cent for military
observers, 73 per cent for military contingents and 89 per cent for civilian
police) (see para. 7 above), the Committee is of the opinion that the delayed
deployment factors applied in the proposed budget for such personnel are
optimistic. It therefore recommends that delayed deployment factors of 20 per
cent for military observers and military contingent personnel and 25 per cent
for civilian police be applied for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004.

A/58/806

2. Civilian personnel

Category Authorizeda Proposed

International staff 200 406

National staffb 250 457

United Nations Volunteers 74 232

a Based on commitment authority.
b Includes National Professional Officers and National General Service staff.

22. Estimated requirements for civilian personnel for the period from 4 April 2004
to 30 June 2005 amount to $64,168,800 ($7,586,200 for the period from 4 April to
30 June 2004 and $56,582,600 for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005).

23. The estimate for international staff ($46,556,700) is based on a phased
deployment, with full deployment to be attained in April 2005. Delayed recruitment
factors of 30 per cent for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004 and 20 per cent for
1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 have been applied for international staff. For national
staff ($10,186,200), full deployment is planned for February 2005, and delayed
recruitment factors of 15 per cent and 10 per cent have been applied for the two
periods respectively. The estimate for United Nations Volunteers ($7,425,900) is
based on a deployment schedule of 232 United Nations Volunteers, including 120
electoral officers to be phased in commencing November 2004. A 10 per cent
delayed deployment factor has been applied for Volunteers.

24. The requirements under civilian personnel include a provision of $411,400 for
mission subsistence allowance and travel costs in respect of eight government-
seconded corrections officers who would be deployed in July 2004 to support and
advise national authorities concerning the prison system.

25. Taking into account the current vacancy rates with respect to the posts
authorized on the basis of the commitment authority granted by the Advisory
Committee (62 per cent for international staff, 60 per cent for national staff
and 89 per cent for United Nations Volunteers) (see para. 7 above), and noting
that an additional 206 international staff, 207 national staff and 158 United
Nations Volunteers are proposed, the Committee believes that the delayed
recruitment and deployment factors applied for civilian personnel could be
adjusted, especially during the start-up phase. The Committee therefore
recommends the application of delayed recruitment factors of 35 per cent for
international staff and United Nations Volunteers and 30 per cent for national
staff for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004.

26. Given that UNOCI is a new mission, its organizational structure receives
considerable attention in the proposed budget (see A/58/788, paras. 10-79). In
general, the Advisory Committee finds the proposed structure to be fragmented
and top-heavy. The Committee recommends that a review be undertaken with a
view to streamlining the structure by combining smaller units or integrating
them into larger sections and eliminating some posts for heads of units and
other higher-level posts, including in the Office of the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General and the Deputy Special Representatives. In this
connection, the Committee questions, inter alia, the establishment of a post of



7
A/58/806

Chief of Staff at the D-2 level. The issue of the direct reporting line of the
Division of Administration to the Special Representative should also be
addressed. In response to the concerns expressed by the Committee, the Special
Representative agreed to review the organizational structure and indicated that it
was planned to integrate both the Training Unit and the United Nations Volunteers
Support Unit into the Personnel Section of the mission. This is the sort of change
the Committee has in mind, and it trusts that efforts will be made to find other
areas where such streamlining can be achieved.

27. The Advisory Committee held an extensive discussion with the representatives
of the Secretary-General concerning the proposed establishment of two Deputy
Special Representative posts within the mission, one for operations and rule of law
and the other for humanitarian coordination, recovery and reconstruction. Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that it was intended that this model should be
used for all future peacekeeping operations, with one Deputy Special Representative
performing functions relating to substantive activities and the other, serving
concurrently as the resident coordinator/humanitarian coordinator, being responsible
for the coordination of all humanitarian and economic activities of the United
Nations system in the mission area. The Committee was also informed that
candidates for the second Deputy Special Representative would come from the pool
of UNDP resident coordinators. This policy was part of a plan that had been
formulated by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in consultation with
other United Nations system actors.

28. While the Advisory Committee is convinced of the importance of the
coordination role, the structure, as shown on the organization chart for the
mission (see ibid., annex), does not appear to support the establishment of a
second Deputy Special Representative post, at least not at the Assistant
Secretary-General level. The Committee notes, for example, that the Deputy
Special Representative for Operations and the Rule of Law is supported by 217
staff, whereas the complement assigned to the Deputy Special Representative for
Humanitarian Coordination, Recovery and Reconstruction is only 21. The
Committee recommends that, pending the review of the organizational
structure of the mission mentioned in paragraph 26 above, the post for the
Deputy Special Representative for Humanitarian Coordination, Recovery and
Reconstruction be approved at the D-2 level. The matter can be revisited, in the
light of experience and the comprehensive review of the organizational
structure of the mission, in the context of the revised budget to be submitted in
September 2004 (see para. 45 below).

29. The Advisory Committee questioned the level of staff for the Political Affairs
Office (1 head of office (D-1), 1 senior political affairs officer (P-5), 9 political
affairs officers (5 P-4 and 4 P-3), 1 General Service staff and 2 national staff). The
Committee requested additional information to justify the level and number of staff.
The information given to the Committee, however, did not provide adequate
justification. Such information should be provided to the Fifth Committee for
its consideration of the proposed budget of UNOCI.

30. The proposed staffing of the Office of the Resident Auditor is to consist of a
senior resident auditor at the P-5 level, three resident auditors (2 P-4 and 1 P-3), an
auditing assistant (General Service (Other level)) and a secretary (national staff) (see
ibid., para. 26). While the Advisory Committee understands that the auditing



8
A/58/806

function is important at the start-up phase, it is of the view that fewer staff are
needed at this early stage. It therefore recommends against approval of the P-4
resident auditor and the auditing assistant. The Committee points out that, as
the auditors are now managed as a pool, should a need arise for more auditing
staff, such staff could be redeployed from other missions.

31. The functions and staffing of the Joint Mission Analysis Cell are set out in
paragraphs 29 and 30 of the proposed budget. Despite a lengthy discussion of the
establishment of this unit with the representatives of the Secretary-General, the
precise functions of the Cell remain unclear. The Committee was informed that such
a structure also existed in UNAMSIL, UNMIL and the United Nations Organization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), but that in those
missions the cells were staffed by military personnel only, and therefore did not
appear on the organization charts of the missions.

32. While the Advisory Committee finds merit in some aspects of the initiative, it
is concerned that little consideration has been given to how this concept fits in with
the systemwide plan for strengthening the security and safety of United Nations
operations, staff and premises. Furthermore, the mission also has a substantial
Security Section under the Division of Administration, and no mention is made of
how those two units might interact. The Committee therefore recommends
against the establishment of the Joint Mission Analysis Cell at this time. The
matter should be reported on in the context of the comprehensive report of the
Secretary-General on strengthening security, to be submitted to the General
Assembly at the first part of its fifty-ninth session.

33. The Advisory Committee notes that the proposed ratio of national staff to
international staff in this mission is, in comparison with other missions, relatively
low. Given the availability of qualified local candidates in Côte d’Ivoire, the
Committee is of the opinion that the staffing of the mission could be adjusted to
include more national staff, particularly in the area of administration, where
the functions would not be of a politically sensitive nature.

34. The Advisory Committee considered the proposed budget of UNOCI without
the benefit of the presence of a Chief Administrative Officer. The Committee
cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of the presence of a Chief
Administrative Officer at the earliest stages of the establishment of a mission to
ensure transparency in administrative and budgetary matters. Every possible
effort should be made to fill the post at once.

3. Operational costs

Training

35. The Advisory Committee was informed that training costs for the period from
4 April to 30 June 2004 were estimated at a total amount of $586,271, including
$29,000 for training consultants, $473,771 for training-related travel and $83,500
for training fees, supplies and services. For the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June
2005, the total amount estimated is $570,068, including $220,600 for training
consultants, $332,433 for travel relating to training and $17,035 for training fees,
supplies and services. The Committee was informed that during the start-up phase
most of the training was for military personnel. The Committee welcomes the
emphasis placed on training within the mission area and in Brindisi, Italy



9
A/58/806

which is clear from the supplementary information provided to it. In future,
the Committee requests that it be provided with a breakdown of the individual
costs of each training request.

36. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 89 of the proposed budget that
the $277,100 requested for consultants includes the cost of consultants for French
language training programmes. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the
consulting costs for such training for the 15-month period amounted to $75,000.
The Committee requests the mission to look into hiring qualified local
personnel to carry out the French language training programme rather than
using expensive consultants.

Official travel

37. Official travel for purposes other than training is estimated at $1,570,747 for
the 15-month period from 4 April 2004 to 30 June 2005. Of that amount, $881,192
relates to travel by Headquarters staff to the mission area. The Advisory Committee
notes from the supplementary information provided to it that a large amount of such
travel is attributable to the Logistics Support Division ($204,780) and the
Administrative Support Division ($122,868) of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations. The Committee considers the amount requested for official travel to
be high and requests the mission to make an effort to control such costs. It
should be recalled that the responsibility for authorizing unforeseen travel
requests rests with the Chief Administrative Officer. That is yet another reason
why the expeditious appointment of a Chief Administrative Officer is essential
(see para. 34 above).

Facilities and infrastructure

38. The Advisory Committee was informed that the construction of a water
purification and bottling plant was being considered. If realized, it would permit the
mission to terminate the contractual arrangements in place for the supply of bottled
water. The Committee was informed that a cost-benefit analysis in this area was
under way. Estimated requirements for the acquisition of water purification and
bottling equipment amount to $1,158,300 for the period from 4 April to 30 June
2004 and $500,700 for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005.

Ground transportation

39. The Advisory Committee was informed that an amount of $4,714,200 was
included under ground transportation for petrol, oil and lubricants for the 15-month
period. The estimate is based on consumption rates of 10 litres per day for light
vehicles and 20 litres per day for medium and heavy vehicles, at a cost of $0.50 per
litre. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that this reflected the application
of standard ratios. The Committee is doubtful that so much fuel will be consumed.

Quick-impact projects

40. An amount of $1 million is included in the estimates for the 15-month period
from 4 April 2004 to 30 June 2005 for quick-impact projects. Upon enquiry, the
Advisory Committee was informed that projects totalling $40,000 had already been
approved and that the mission had the capacity to implement further projects. In the
opinion of the Committee, the capacity to implement quick-impact projects



10

A/58/806

should play a key role in determining the level of resources to be dedicated to
them. Care should also be taken to ensure that projects fall within the
framework envisaged in the report of the Panel on United Nations
Peacekeeping Operations (A/55/305-S/2000/809). Moreover, it is important that
the creation of bureaucratic structures to support the implementation of such
projects be avoided, as this cuts into the funding available for the projects
themselves. The Committee believes that the time has come to undertake an
analysis of the experience of missions in the implementation of quick-impact
projects. It therefore requests that a review be undertaken and reported on in
the next overview report of the Secretary-General on peacekeeping operations.

Inventory management

41. The Advisory Committee was informed that the estimate for facilities and
infrastructure for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 included a provision
of $218,500 for the replacement of 200 air conditioners transferred from the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), which are to
be written off. Under ground transportation, the estimate for acquisition of vehicles
for the same period ($26,118,100) includes provision for the replacement of 164
vehicles to be written off, which had been transferred from MINUCI and other
missions. Similarly, the estimate for information technology includes the
replacement of 82 desktop computers and 82 monitors transferred from MONUC
and UNAMSIL. The Committee understands that United Nations Logistics Base at
Brindisi and strategic deployment stocks are depleted and that a calculation has been
made that waiting for equipment that requires long procurement lead times could
seriously delay the deployment of the mission. However, such equipment as air
conditioners and computers should be readily available and in stock in warehouses
throughout the world. To incur freight charges and/or possible disposal costs for
transferred equipment that must be written off three months after it is acquired does
not make sense. The Committee has commented on this matter in its general report
on peacekeeping operations (A/58/759).

42. At the request of the Advisory Committee, the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations reviewed the issue of the air conditioners received from MINURSO and
concluded that they would not need to be replaced in 2004/05. The requirements
for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 should consequently be
reduced by $218,500.

Application of standard ratios

43. The Advisory Committee has noted that in some cases the application of
standard ratios for vehicles and information technology equipment does not seem to
be appropriate to the mission (see, for example, para. 39 above). The Committee
requests the Secretariat to examine this issue in the peacekeeping missions as a
whole and to report on its findings in the next overview report on peacekeeping
operations.

III. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

44. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of UNOCI for the period from 4 April 2004 to 30 June 2005 is indicated



11

A/58/806

in paragraph 102 of the proposed budget (A/58/788). Taking into account its
recommendations set out in paragraphs 21, 25, 28, 30 and 32 above, the
Advisory Committee recommends that the estimated budget requirements of
$101,061,200 for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004 be reduced by
$4,693,100. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the General
Assembly appropriate an amount of $96,368,100 gross ($95,601,200 net) for the
establishment of UNOCI for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004, inclusive
of $49,943,300 previously authorized by the Committee.

45. For the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, the Advisory Committee
recommends appropriation of an amount of $200,646,600 gross ($197,058,600
net) at this time, or a reduction of 50 per cent, to cover the requirements of the
mission to 31 December 2004. Consistent with section I, paragraph 4, of
General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994, a revised budget
should be presented to the General Assembly, through the Advisory
Committee, in September 2004. At that time, progress on streamlining the
organizational structure and the signing of memorandums of understanding, as
well as the availability of updated vacancy information, will allow for a better
determination of real needs.

Annex I
Letter dated 24 March 2004 from the Chairman of the
Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions to the Secretary-General

The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the letter dated 17 March 2004 from the Officer-in-Charge of the Office
of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts who seeks the concurrence of the
Advisory Committee to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed
$49,943,300 to cover the initial critical and logistical and personnel requirements
related to the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) for the period
from 4 April through 30 June 2004.

The Committee notes that the resources requested relate to Security Council
resolution 1528 (2004) of 27 February 2004, which, besides establishing the
mission, requested the transfer of authority from the United Nations Mission in Côte
d’Ivoire (MINUCI) and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) forces to UNOCI as of 4 April 2004.

As indicated in the letter and during the hearings conducted by the Committee,
the estimates provide for the support of 1,365 ECOWAS troops to be transferred
under UNOCI authority, the phased emplacement of 3,705 additional military
contingent personnel and 120 military staff officers, for a total of 5,190 military
contingent personnel, as well as deployment of 200 military observers, including 76
already authorized for MINUCI, and 54 civilian police officers. The Committee
welcomes the training courses undertaken to train the troops in the transfer of
responsibilities.

The estimates also provide for the deployment of 200 core international staff,
250 national staff and 74 United Nations Volunteers, taking into account the 69
international staff, 62 national staff and 7 United Nations Volunteers already
approved for MINUCI. Also covered is procurement of equipment not available
from the strategic deployment stocks and other missions, strategic air and sea
transport, as well as freight and related costs related to transfers from the United
Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.

The Committee notes that the budgetary requirements for UNOCI for the
period 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 are being prepared and will be submitted to the
General Assembly during the second part of its resumed fifty-eighth session. The
Committee is aware that at that time actual deployment schedules will be provided
for contingents and there will be a better idea of the quantum of resources required.

In the meantime, pursuant to section IV of General Assembly resolution
49/233 A of 23 December 1994, the Advisory Committee concurs with the request
for authorization to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed $49,943,300
gross ($49,095,100 net) to meet the cost of initial critical logistical and personnel
requirements of the operation in Côte d’Ivoire for the period through 30 June 2004.

Annex III
Funding for the disarmament, demobilization,
reintegration, repatriation and resettlement programme

• The total cost of implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programme is estimated to be approximately $105 million. The
Government of National Reconciliation has already funded 8.4 billion CFA
francs (approximately $16 million) for the establishment of the National
Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration, the repair
and equipping of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration sites and the
sensitization programme. The Government of National Reconciliation will also
be involved in the repair of the remaining disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration sites, as well as in the reintegration of ex-combatants.

• The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the lead partner in
the National Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration.
UNDP is funding the identification and profiling of ex-combatants project with
$1 million.

• UNDP, along with French Cooperation ($350,000) and the European Union
($600,000), is providing $300,000 for the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration communication and sensitization plan.

• UNDP secured $2.8 million from the European Union for equipping and
staffing the regrouping, demobilization and child solider sites.

• UNDP secured $2.9 million from Japan for the rehabilitation and equipping of
six disarmament, demobilization and reintegration sites envisaged to be used
during the second phase of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
process.

• UNDP is securing $5 million from Japan and $1.5 million from Belgium for
the reinsertion programme.

• UNDP, in collaboration with French Cooperation, which is providing
$350,000, plans to equip the sport and leisure facilities at the cantonment sites.

• The World Bank will finance the reintegration of the ex-combatants (mainly
the reinsertion package) and the reintegration, repatriation and resettlement
programme on a long-term-loan basis. An amount of $60 million has been
estimated as the cost for the implementation of the programme, of which 50
per cent will be allotted for the reintegration of the ex-combatants.

• UNICEF received financial resources in support of the disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers from Sweden, the
Netherlands, French Cooperation and UNICEF-France ($282,000). Discussions
are under way regarding funding from Norway and Belgium Cooperation.
