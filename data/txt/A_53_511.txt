Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction II. Actuarial matters

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and 2. Paragraphs 14 to 47 of the report of the Pension Board
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the United deal with actuarial matters, including the results of the
Nations Joint Staff Pension Board to the General Assembly twenty-fourth actuarial valuation of the Fund as at 31
at its fifty-third session. The Committee also had before it the December 1997; the previous valuation was prepared as at1
report of the Secretary-General on the investments of the 31 December 1995 and its results were reported to the
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (A/C.5/53/18) and General Assembly at its fifty-first session in 1996. The
the report of the Board of Auditors to the General Assembly actuarial valuation determines whether the present and
on the accounts of the Fund for the biennium ended 31 estimated future assets of the Fund will be sufficient to meet
December 1997. In addition, the Committee was provided its liabilities.2
with a copy of a concept paper on administrative
arrangements between the Fund and other member
organizations prepared by the secretariat of the Pension Fund3
and an advance copy of the Secretary-General’s report
(A/C.5/53/3) on the administrative and financial implications
that would arise to the regular budget of the United Nations
should the General Assembly adopt the recommendations
submitted to it in the report of the Pension Board. During its
consideration of these matters, the Committee met with the
Chairman of the Pension Board, representatives of the
Secretary-General and the secretariat of the Pension Fund.

3. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 18 of
the current report that the Pension Board approved the
actuarial assumptions recommended by the Committee of
Actuaries to serve as the basis for the twenty-fourth actuarial
valuation, prepared as at 31 December 1997. Paragraph 20
of the report gives the results of the twenty-fourth regular
valuation as compared to the results of the previous valuation
as at 31 December 1995. The economic assumptions for the
regular valuation as at 31 December 1997 were the same as
those used in the previous valuation; however, with respect
to the growth of participants, a “zero participant growth
assumption” served as the basis for the regular valuation as
at 31 December 1997.

pensionable remuneration. The elements contributing to the that the matter be maintained under review in the light of the
decrease in the required rate of contribution are described in results of future actuarial valuations of the Fund.
paragraph 22. That result was mainly owing to the
strengthening of the United States dollar and the investment
returns since the last valuation.
5. In paragraphs 26 to 28 of the report of the Pension decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the
Board, the results of the actuarial valuation of the Fund are threshold for effecting cost-of-living adjustments of pensions

at 31 December 1997 represented only 1.0 per cent of the
projected liabilities of the Fund. The projected deficit under
the regular valuation as at 31 December 1995 had been
$1,688.7 million, which had represented 4 per cent of the
projected liabilities of the Fund. Upon request, the Committee
was furnished with a table showing the evolution of actuarial
valuation of the Fund since 1976, both in absolute terms and
as a percentage of projected liabilities (see annex I to the
present report). The Advisory Committee notes that, for the
first time, since the valuation as at 31 December 1976, the
regular valuation as at 31 December 1997 disclosed a small
surplus when measured against the present contribution rate
of 23.7 per cent of pensionable remuneration.
6. In paragraph 37 of its report, the Pension Board noted
the conclusion of the Committee of Actuaries that “the present
contribution rate of 23.7 per cent of pensionable remuneration
remained appropriate and should be retained, pending review
on the occasion of the next valuation”. The Advisory
Committee agrees with that view and recommends that the
present contribution rate of 23.7 per cent be retained. In the
view of the Committee, the Board should continue to monitor
closely the evolution of the actuarial valuation of the Fund and
no attempt should be made to reduce the present rate of
contributions to the Fund or change any other features unless
and until a pattern of surpluses emerges in future valuations.
7. A review of the subject of interest rates applicable to
lump-sum commutations of periodic benefits under article 28
(g) of the regulations of the Fund is discussed in paragraphs
38 to 47 of the Pension Board’s report. The Advisory
Committee notes from paragraphs 44 to 47 of the report that
the Board decided on a conservative basis “to change the rate
applicable to lump-sum commutations to 6 per cent, with
respect to contributory service performed as from 1 January
2001, subject to a favourable actuarial valuation as at 31
December 1999” (para. 46). However, on a strictly technical

of-living adjustments of pensions in award is discussed in

9. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as
requested by the Pension Board, the Secretary of the Board,
with the assistance of the Consulting Actuary, would review
all changes made in the pension system since 1983, when
measures were approved by the General Assembly to redress
the past actuarial deficit of the Fund. The results of the review
would be submitted to the Standing Committee of the Board
in 1999, together with the views of the Committee of
Actuaries. The Board would consider in 2000 the views and
recommendations of the Standing Committee, in the light of
the results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 December 1999.

III. Investments of the Pension Fund

10. As stated by the Secretary-General in his report
(A/C.5/53/18, paras. 19 and 27), the market value of the
Fund’s assets increased by $4,631 million, from $15,539
million on 31 March 1996 to $20,170 million on 31 March
1998, or 29.8 per cent. The total investment returns for the
year ended 31 March 1997 and 31 March 1998 were 8.9 per
cent and 20.4 per cent, respectively. After adjustment by the
United States consumer price index, the “real” rates of return
for the years ended 31 March 1997 and 31 March 1998 were
5.9 per cent and 18.9 per cent, respectively. The cumulative
annualized total rate of return over the 38-year period for
which data are available was 9 per cent, or a “real” rate of
return of 3.8 per cent, after adjustment by the United States
consumer price index. The Committee is aware that the
market value of the Fund is subject to fluctuation.
11. The Advisory Committee notes that, pursuant to
General Assembly resolution 49/224 of 23 December 1994,
the Secretary-General has begun to develop a benchmark to
compare the Fund’s performance with major international



A/53/511

3

equity and bond indexes. The benchmark was implemented Accordingly, the amounts fixed in the agreement between the
in January 1997 (A/C.5/53/18, para. 33). Fund and its custodians are not the same for each custodian.

IV. Investments Committee

12. Article 20 of the Regulations of the Fund provides that
members of the Investments Committee shall be appointed
by the Secretary-General after consultation with the Pension
Board and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions, subject to confirmation by the General
Assembly. The Secretary-General conveyed to the Board the5
names of three members of the Investments Committee, whom
he intended to propose to the General Assembly for
confirmation at its fifty-third session, after consultation with
the Advisory Committee. The Committee has written in this6
regard to the Secretary-General to convey its concurrence.

V. Financial statements of the Fund and
report of the Board of Auditors

13. The Pension Board examined and approved the
financial statements and related data on the operations of the
Fund for the biennium ended 31 December 1997 and
considered the findings and recommendations of the Board
of Auditors.7

14. On the issue of insurance coverage for the Fund’s
investments in equities, the Pension Board noted that the8
Board of Auditors had considered that the assets of the Fund
had not been adequately protected and had recommended that
the contracts with the Fund’s custodians should be reviewed,
with a view to providing adequate insurance coverage. The
amounts fixed in the agreements between the Fund and the
custodians had showed inconsistencies in the amounts fixed
in the agreements in relation to the assets in the custody or
control of the custodians, which ranged between 0.2 and 8.2
per cent of the market value of the assets held by the Fund’s
custodians. The Pension Board therefore recommended that
the matter be reviewed, with a view to providing adequate
insurance coverage.9

15. In his reply, the Secretary-General indicated that it10
was not an industry practice for the custodians to maintain
insurance against the entire value of the assets they hold. “The
custody agreement between the Fund and its custodians
requires the custodians to maintain insurance coverage at all
times on assets in their custody or under their control against
losses arising out of employee dishonesty, on-premises
and in-transit loss of assets, and forgery or alteration,
including forgery of securities and counterfeit currency”.11

Furthermore, once the securities were segregated, in accounts
established in the name of the United Nations for the Fund,
they were protected from all third-party claims, including
those arising from bankruptcy of the custodians. The Advisory
Committee notes that the Secretary-General is reviewing the
matter and will provide information to the Pension Board on
any action that may be necessary in due course, taking into
account the desire both to ensure security and avoid
unnecessary cost increases. In the light of the views stated12
by the Secretary-General, the Committee believes that there
is no need to maintain insurance against the entire value of
the assets held by the custodians.
16. On the issue of the verification of thumbprints and
signatures in respect of certificates of entitlement returned by
Fund beneficiaries, the Advisory Committee is of the view13
that, regardless of the system finally implemented, it must
remain cost-effective.
17. On the subject of arrangements for internal audit of the
Fund’s operations, the Board agreed to continue with the14
Office of Internal Oversight Services as the Fund’s internal
auditors at least until the end of the biennium 2000–2001.
The Board also recognized that, since the Fund was an inter-
agency entity, it may be more appropriate in the long term for
the internal auditing of the Fund to be carried out by an office
within the secretariat of the Fund, reporting directly to the
Chief Executive Officer of the Fund. In the meantime, the
Board agreed to keep under review the effectiveness of the
internal audit work performed by Office of Internal Oversight
Services and to revert to the matter in 2000, based on a
detailed report to be submitted to the Board. It also agreed
that the arrangements for internal audit of the Fund should
form part of the comprehensive study on the Fund’s long-term
administrative requirements.

VI. Administrative arrangements
between the Fund and the United
Nations and with other member
organizations

18. The Advisory Committee welcomes the concept paper3
which provides a review of the current cost-sharing
arrangements between the Fund and the United Nations
and with other member organizations. The paper includes
proposals for changes in those arrangements, in respect of the
pension services provided by the Fund secretariat for the
active participants employed by the United Nations and its

continue to fully absorb the costs related to the other services
and facilities provided to the Fund, such as staff payroll
processing, personnel and procurement services and
miscellaneous supplies. The cost-sharing formula would take
effect on 1 January 1999 and would be reviewed every six
years.15

the Fund would amount to $730,800, as from 1 January 1999.
Based on the expected additional costs to be borne by the
Fund and the drop in the level of total pensionable
remuneration due to exchange-rate fluctuation, the16
Committee of Actuaries estimated that the administrative
costs of the Fund were likely to rise to the order of 0.25 per
cent of pensionable remuneration.17

Committee notes that the Secretary of the Pension Board will
submit a report on these matters in conjunction with the
Fund’s budget proposals for the biennium 2000–2001. The20

24. Revised administrative expenses for the biennium
1998–1999 are discussed in paragraphs 203 to 244 of the
Board’s report. The Board recommended to the General
Assembly approval of additional expenses amounting to
$4,161,700 net over the initial appropriation of $50,069,500
for the biennium 1998–1999. Table 2 of annex VIII of the22

Investment Management Service of the Fund and, Deputy shall be appointed by the Secretary-General on
consequently, endorsed the reclassification of the post of the the recommendation of the Board.”
Chief of the Service, from the D-1 to the D-2 level. The
Committee agrees with that proposal.
26. In paragraphs 236 to 237 of its report, the Pension
Board makes recommendations with regard to the level and
the title of the post of the Secretary of the Board. It proposes
the reclassification of the post to a level above the present D-
2 grade and favoured making the post an “ungraded” post,
with a base salary and related allowances set at the mid-point
between the top step of the D-2 level and the Assistant
Secretary-General level. The Board also recommends a
change in the present title of the post to “Chief Executive
Officer of the Fund and Executive Secretary of the Board”
and, accordingly, changes in the relevant Regulations of the
Fund to reflect that proposal.23

27. The proposal of the Board reminds the Advisory
Committee of a similar proposal made by the Secretary-
General in 1993 to create a D-3 level for a very limited
number of posts (see A/C.5/47/88). In its related report, the
Advisory Committee put forward a number of considerations
which led it to recommend against the expansion of the
Director category, including the eventual pressure to create
more posts at that level, the potential for administrative
confusion and the difficulties in the exercise of authority by
what would be “a second-class Assistant Secretary-
General”. The proposal to create a D-3 level was eventually24
withdrawn by the Secretary-General. For similar reasons, the
Advisory Committee is against the establishment of an
“ungraded” level for the Chief Executive Officer of the
Pension Fund. It believes that the responsibilities of the post,
which have greatly expanded in recent years (see para. 235
of the report of the Board), justify its upgrading to the
Assistant Secretary-General level.
28. With respect to the changes in the title of the post of the
Secretary of the Board and the corresponding changes in the
Regulations of the Fund, the Advisory Committee agrees with
the proposal of changing the title of the post to “Chief
Executive Officer” of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension
Fund, which would reflect the actual responsibilities carried
out by the incumbent as the head of a large and complex
pension operation. However, the Committee is of the view
that, since one of the functions of the Chief Executive Officer
is to serve as Secretary of the Board, there is no reason to
change that functional title to “Executive Secretary of the
Board”. Accordingly, article 7 (a) of the Regulations of the
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund could read:

Article 7 (c) could read:
“The Chief Executive Officer shall perform that

function under the authority of the Board and shall
certify for payment all benefits properly payable under
these Regulations. The Chief Executive Officer shall
also serve as Secretary of the Board. In the absence of
the Chief Executive Officer of the Fund, the Deputy
Chief Executive Officer shall perform these functions.”

VII. Other matters

29. As regards entitlement to survivors’ benefits for
spouses and former spouses, the Advisory Committee agrees25
with the recommendations of the Pension Board to the
General Assembly, as indicated in paragraphs 290, 303 and
312 of the Board’s report.
30. On the subject of the review by the International Civil
Service Commission of the common scale of staff assessment
for pensionable remuneration purposes, the Advisory26
Committee shares the view of the Pension Board, as indicated
in paragraph 348 of the Board’s report.
31. With regard to the possible withdrawal of the Interim
Commission for the International Trade Organization/
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (ICITO/GATT) from
the membership of the Fund, the Advisory Committee was27
informed that, on several occasions, the Committee of
Actuaries and the Board had discussed the methodology to be
used to determine the proportionate share of the Fund’s
assets, payable under article 16 of the Fund’s Regulations to
a withdrawing organization. The Chairman of the Pension
Board informed the Committee that the actuarial consultants
retained by the World Trade Organization (WTO) have
presented differing views regarding the methodology; they
also prepared documents certifying the costs of the proposed
new salary and pension arrangements of WTO. Based upon
that information, the WTO General Council is expected to
take a decision on 15 October 1998 as to whether to apply
formally for termination of the membership of ICITO/GATT
in the Fund.
32. The Committee was informed that, if WTO submits a
formal application for withdrawal, there would be need for
a special meeting of the Committee of Actuaries during the
first part of November 1998, probably in Geneva, followed
by a special session of the Pension Board to act on the
recommendations of the Committee of Actuaries and,



A/53/511

6

accordingly, make recommendations to the General Assembly
at its fifty-third session. The Advisory Committee recalls that,
as indicated in paragraph 300 of the Pension Board’s report
to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session, with regard28
to the possible withdrawal of ICITO/GATT, the Board agreed
that, just as with any other organization in that position,
ICITO/GATT would have to meet the costs that would be
incurred by the Fund in responding to any formal request for
withdrawal from the Fund, including the costs of any special
session of the Board. Upon inquiry, the Committee was
informed that such cost reimbursement would also include the
costs associated with the special meeting of the Committee
of Actuaries.
