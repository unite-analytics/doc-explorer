Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the
United Nations peacekeeping operations

Updated financial position of closed peacekeeping missions

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/58/778) on the updated financial
position of the 18 closed missions listed in paragraph 1 thereof.

2. In its resolution 57/323 of 18 June 2003, the General Assembly requested the
Secretary-General to return 50 per cent of the net cash available for credit to
Member States as at 30 June 2002, in the amount of US$ 84,446,000, by 30 June
2003, and decided to postpone the return of the remaining 50 per cent until March
2004 in respect of the fund balances of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
listed in paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General’s report.

3. In its resolution 58/288 of 8 April 2004, the General Assembly subsequently
decided to postpone the return of the amount of $84,446,000 until 30 June 2004.

4. The Advisory Committee notes from table 1 of the above-mentioned report of
the Secretary-General that the net cash available for credit to Member States as at
30 June 2003 amounted to $178,684,000, inclusive of the amount of $84,446,000
that has not yet been credited to Member States. Once this credit has been applied,
the balance remaining would be $94,238,000.

5. As indicated in paragraph 6 of the report of the Secretary-General, loans
totalling $152 million that were made between 30 June 2003 and 31 March 2004 in
order to sustain operations have been fully repaid.

6. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report of the
Secretary-General that 6 of the 18 peacekeeping missions included in the report had
cash deficits totalling $101 million as at 30 June 2003 due to outstanding payments
of assessed contributions. The Advisory Committee was provided with information
on unpaid assessments, accounts payable to Member States and other liabilities of
closed missions as at 30 June 2003 (see annex I below).

* Reissued for technical reasons.

7. The cash available in the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund as at 31 March 2004
amounted to $150,300,000 inclusive of interest income of $11,046,000.
Developments with regard to new missions and follow-on operations are discussed
in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Secretary-General’s report.

8. The Committee requested and received updated projected cash requirements
for the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI), the United Nations
Operation in Burundi (ONUB) and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH) which are provided in annex II below.

9. In paragraph 12 of his report, the Secretary-General put forth a number of
considerations with regard to the use of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund, its
adequacy with respect to meeting foreseen requirements and the importance of
assuring adequate funding for new peacekeeping operations, particularly at their
beginning stages.

10. In paragraph 13 of his report, the Secretary-General proposed that, following
the crediting of $84,446,000 to Member States by 30 June 2004 in accordance with
Assembly resolution 58/288, the remaining cash available totalling $94,238,000 be
retained until 31 October 2004 to supplement the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund in
order to finance the initial requirements of the new peacekeeping operations. In the
view of the Advisory Committee, the postponement of the return of “available
cash” to Member States is a policy decision to be determined by the Assembly.
However, in the view of the Advisory Committee, the points raised by it in
paragraph 12 of its report on the implementation of paragraph 3 of Assembly
resolution 57/323: Peacekeeping Reserve Fund (A/58/732) still remain valid and
the Assembly may wish to take them into account in reaching its decision.
