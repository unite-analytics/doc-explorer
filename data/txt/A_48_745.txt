PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 1992-1993

PROPOSED PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 1994-1995

Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in South Africa

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/48/28), which provides
information on the financial performance of the United Nations Observer Mission
in South Africa (UNOMSA) for the period from mid-September 1992 to
31 December 1993 and the cost estimates for UNOMSA for the period from 1 January
to 31 July 1994. During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee
met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional
information to the Committee.

2. In paragraph 16 of his report, the Secretary-General outlines the actions
that would appear to be required to be taken by the General Assembly at its
forty-eighth session in connection with the financing of UNOMSA.

3. The savings (overruns) incurred in respect of the main objects of
expenditure of UNOMSA for the period mid-September 1992 to 31 December 1993 are
summarized in annex I to the report, with supplementary information thereon
provided in annex II. The Advisory Committee notes that, according to the
performance report for that period, the projected expenditure for a number of
items varies considerably from the cost estimates for the period. For example,
there are substantial savings under general temporary assistance, consultants,
travel, and rental of aircraft, and large overexpenditure on salaries, vehicle
operation and communications. The Committee recalls that substantial savings
and overexpenditures in an operation should be well explained in the performance
report.

4. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 19 of the report of the
Secretary-General (A/C.5/48/28) that $61,200 (overrun) for the period from
mid-September 1992 to 31 December 1993 will be reflected in the second
performance report under section 2 of the programme budget for 1992-1993.

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that as at 3 December 1993 there were
60 international staff, comprising one Chief of Mission, a Deputy Chief of
Mission, 50 observers and eight support staff. The Secretary-General proposes
an addition of 56 international staff, comprising 50 observers (already approved
by the Security Council) 1/ and six support staff, effective 1 December 1993.

6. In paragraph 9 of the report, the Secretary-General proposes to create as
at 1 November 1993 a temporary post at the Assistant Secretary-General level for
the Chief of Mission of UNOMSA and the Deputy Chief of Mission to occupy the
post at the D-2 level. In addition, in paragraphs 10 and 11, he proposes to
provide for the Senior Advisor/Observer (currently on loan from the Department
of Political Affairs), the post at the D-1 level currently occupied by the
Deputy Head of Mission, as well as establishing 10 observer posts at the
P-5 level. The Committee has no objection to these proposals.

7. The Secretary-General estimates the cost for the period 1 January to
31 July 1994 at $8,994,100. Annexes IV and V to his report (A/C.5/48/28)
provide a summary statement and supplementary information in respect of this
estimate.

8. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 14 of the report that the above
estimates relate only to the requirements of the Mission prior to and after the
election, without taking into account possible additional electoral
requirements. Should relevant decisions be made concerning specific additional
requirements, and/or the extension of the Mission beyond 31 July 1994, the
Secretary-General would seek the concurrence of the Advisory Committee to enter
into related commitments under the terms of the General Assembly resolution to
be adopted on unforseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 1994-1995.

9. Upon inquiry as to the high cost of premises, the Advisory Committee was
informed that negotiations are under way to obtain premises at reasonable cost.
The Committee trusts that every effort will be made to seek the Governmentâ€™s
assistance in procuring office space with minimum charge to the United Nations.

10. With regard to general purchase of materials and service, the Advisory
Committee reiterates its recommendation that, whenever cost-effective and
technically feasible, every reasonable effort should be made by the Secretariat,
in accordance with established procedures, to acquire services, resources and
materials from local area sources (A/47/896, para. 13). In this regard, the
Committee was informed that office furniture would be purchased locally.

11. Taking into account its observations, the Advisory Committee, without
prejudice to such decisions as the General Assembly may take on the mode of
financing of UNOMSA, recommends that the estimate of $8,994,100 for UNOMSA
should be approved for the period from 1 January to 31 July 1994.
