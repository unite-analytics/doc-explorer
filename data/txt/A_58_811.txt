Agenda item 170
Financing of the United Nations Operation in Burundi

Interim budget for the United Nations Operation in
Burundi for the period from 21 April to 31 December 2004

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The situation concerning the proposals in the interim budget for the United
Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) (A/58/802) is similar to that which was
referred to in respect of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and the
United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor in the Advisory Committeeâ€™s
report on those missions (A/58/809).

2. The Advisory Committee is therefore recommending that the proposal of
the Secretary-General with respect to ONUB be dealt with in a similar fashion.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve
commitment authority in the amount of $49,709,300, inclusive of an amount of
$49,491,200 previously authorized by the Committee, for the period from 21
April to 30 June 2004. For the period from July to October 2004, the Advisory
Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve commitment
authority in the amount of $106,334,600. Thus, total commitment authority for
ONUB, inclusive of the amount previously authorized by the Advisory
Committee, would be $156,043,900. The Committee recommends assessment of
this amount for ONUB.

3. In this connection, the Advisory Committee trusts that the Secretariat will
take fully into account the considerations expressed in paragraphs 8 and 9 of
its above-mentioned report. These considerations are also relevant to the
United Nations Operation in Burundi.
