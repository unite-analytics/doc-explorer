Agenda item 133
Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations

Financial performance report for the period from 1 July
2000 to 30 June 2001 and proposed budget for the period
from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 for the support account
for peacekeeping operations

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions*

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the
Secretary-General on the financial performance of the
support account for peacekeeping operations for the
period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/56/882).
The Committee has also considered the report of the
Secretary-General on the estimated requirements for
the support account for the period from 1 July 2002 to
30 June 2003 (A/56/885). During its consideration of
the reports, the Committee met with the representatives
of the Secretary-General, who provided additional
information and clarification.

I. Financial performance report for
the period from 1 July 2000 to 30
June 2001

2. The Committee recalls that the General
Assembly, in its resolution 54/243 B of 15 June 2000,
originally authorized an amount of $50,699,900 gross
($43,237,900 net) for support account post and non-
post requirements for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30
June 2001, approving a total staffing establishment of
469 posts. Having considered the report of the
Secretary-General on resource requirements for the
implementation of the report of the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations (A/55/507 and Add.1), the
General Assembly, in section I of its resolution 55/238
of 23 December 2000, approved additional post and
non-post requirements for the period from 1 January to
30 June 2001 of $9,190,200 gross ($8,741,600 net),
including 93 additional posts. The total resources made
available for the support account for the period from 1
July 2000 to 30 June 2001 therefore amounted to
$59,890,100 gross ($51,979,500 net).

* The proposed budget for the support account was made
available to the Committee, in an advance version in
English only, shortly before the end of its winter
meetings. It was therefore necessary to draft the present
report after those meetings had adjourned. The
Committee commenced its spring meetings on 7 May
2002, and approved its report on the support account and
submitted it for processing on 8 May.

A/56/941

3. The expenditures for the period amounted to
$62,026,300 gross ($53,373,900 net), resulting in
additional requirements of $2,136,200 gross
($1,394,400 net) — in gross terms, 4 per cent of the
approved resources for the period. As indicated in the
performance report (A/56/882, para. 7), additional
requirements of $3.6 million resulted from
underbudgeted requirements under common staff costs
for General Service staff ($2.9 million) and staff
assessment ($0.7 million). The Committee was
informed that this was due to an error in budget
calculation resulting in an understatement of the
requirement. This was partially offset by an
underexpenditure of $1.5 million under non-post
resources (see also A/56/882, table 1).

4. The Committee notes that, for the initial 469
posts approved, a vacancy factor of 8 per cent for
Professional staff in the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, 6.5 per cent for all other Professional staff,
and 2.5 per cent for General Service posts had been
applied. For the additional 93 posts approved, a 50 per
cent delayed recruitment factor was applied. The
Committee notes from the performance report (para. 9
and table 2) that the actual average vacancy rate was
12.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent for the 469 continuing
posts in the Professional and the General Service
categories, respectively, and 54.2 per cent and 9.5 per
cent for the 93 new posts in the Professional and
General Service categories, respectively. The savings
resulting from the higher than budgeted vacancy rates
were more than offset by the underbudgeted
requirements under common staff costs for General
Service staff, particularly in the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of
Management (see A/56/882, annex II, paras. 1-3).

5. The savings under non-post resources are
summarized in the performance report (table 1 and
annex II, paras. 5-14). The Committee notes that a
large part of the savings result from underexpenditures
for electronic data processing equipment ($1,116,200),
as a consequence of the delays in the relocation of
peacekeeping staff to the additional space completed
only at the end of 2001 (see annex II, para. 11).

6. The action to be taken by the General Assembly
in connection with the performance report is set out in
paragraph 11, of the report (A/56/882). The
Committee recommends approval of the action
proposed by the Secretary-General therein.

II. Proposed cost estimates for the period
from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003

Format and presentation

7. The Committee notes that the estimates for
support account resources for the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 are presented, for the first time,
using the results-based budgeting format, in accordance
with the request of the Committee, endorsed by the
General Assembly in its resolutions 55/231, 55/271 and
56/241. The Committee discussed the new format with
the representatives of the Secretary-General, who
informed the Committee that the presentation would be
improved in future, taking into account such guidelines
as the Committee and the General Assembly would
provide.

8. The Committee welcomes the efforts to
streamline the budget presentation. The Committee
is of the view, however, that adequate justification
of the proposed estimates should be maintained,
and that accurate workload data and analysis
should become an integral part of the budget
proposals. The Committee recalls its comments in
earlier reports (see A/55/882, para. 12 and A/56/478,
para. 10).

9. Accordingly, while it acknowledges the efforts
made by the Secretariat, the Committee is of the
opinion that, in preparing the next estimates,
further progress should be made in defining more
clearly objectives and expected results.
Furthermore, the budget process should ensure that
the indicators are relevant and can be used as
elements to measure the achievement of the
expected results. Ideally, therefore, the 210 outputs
summarized in section X of the budget report
(A/56/885) should provide evidence that they are
contributing to the implementation of the stated
objectives and the attainment of the expected
results.

10. The Committee has made relevant comments and
recommendations on the results-based budgeting
format in its first report on the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/7, paras. 4-
18) and in its report on the administrative and
budgetary aspects of the financing of the United
Nations peacekeeping operations (A/56/887, paras. 25-
26).

A/56/941

11. The Committee is of the opinion that the
presentation of peacekeeping budgets, including
support account budgets, should be tailored to the
circumstances of peacekeeping operations rather
than attempt to mirror the presentation of the
regular budget. The presentation should be
realistic, and define objectives and expected
accomplishments, which must be attainable in the
context of the services required of the peacekeeping
operation concerned and in the time frame for the
delivery of those services. In this connection, a
distinction must be made between what can be
accomplished within the budget period and what
are longer-term expectations. For example, with
regard to the statement of expected
accomplishments in support to peacekeeping
operations as a whole made in paragraph 6 of the
budget report, the Committee does not believe that
it has been demonstrated clearly in the report how
these can be achieved between 1 July 2002 and 30
June 2003.

12. In paragraph 7 of the report it is stated that to
reach those accomplishments, the Organization would
require the budget resources that are reflected in
table 2. In the opinion of the Committee, that
statement is too broad to be useful and should be
avoided in future in any budget prepared according
to the results-based budgeting format.
Furthermore, it would be helpful if the Secretariat
could demonstrate in the presentation, and in
additional information to be supplied to the
Committee, what the consequences would be if a
specific level of staff or non-staff resources
proposed were not authorized for the activities
concerned. The limited statements in paragraphs
17, 18, 22, 105 and 106 appear to be conclusions,
without an indication of the underlying analysis,
including workload analysis, leading to those
conclusions. In this regard, the comments of the
Committee in paragraph 8 above, on the need for
adequate justification, become pertinent.

13. Moreover, in order to promote accountability,
the responsibility of each unit and programme
manager in the delivery of services should be
obvious and stated more clearly. To this end, the
level of aggregation of objectives and expected
results contained in the current submission should
be re-examined. As a starting point, the budget
performance for the period ending 30 June 2003

should concentrate on providing information on the
extent to which organizational units and the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations as a whole
have attained their respective expected
accomplishments.

14. As to the non-staff cost tables, the Committee
recommends that these be further broken down to
include amounts appropriated and spent during the
past two periods, in order to allow better analysis of
the resources proposed.

15. In addition, information should be included in
future reports as to the action taken to implement
the Committee’s recommendations.

Analysis of the proposed cost estimates

16. The Secretary-General, in his report on the
proposed budget (A/56/885), estimates support account
resources for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June
2003 at $102,316,380 gross ($88,389,480 net), which
would provide for the staffing of 711 temporary posts.
The Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in
its resolution 55/271 of 14 June 2001, approved 562
support account-funded temporary posts for the period
from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 and that, in its
resolution 56/241 of 24 December 2001, it approved an
additional 121 posts for the remaining six-month
period, from 1 January to 30 June 2002, after
consideration of the resources related to the
comprehensive review and capacity study requested by
the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations.

17. As shown in table 2 of the report, the amount
proposed, in gross terms, represents an increase of
$12,567,130 ($12,467,800 net) over the total amount
approved for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June
2002 of $89,749,250 gross. Most of the increase
($9,359,700) is due to the full 12-month costing of the
additional 121 posts and non-post resources approved
by the General Assembly in resolution 56/241, and the
four posts approved in resolution 56/255 for the Office
of the United Nations Security Coordinator, in addition
to costs related to the proposal to establish 24
additional posts. Other increases include training
($2,055,000), consultants and experts ($938,600), staff
assessment ($3,486,150), and travel ($546,400). These
are offset by various decreases, mainly under general
operating expenses ($3,053,950).

18. The level of resources proposed takes into
account the projected scope of peacekeeping operations



4
A/56/941

shown in table 1 of the budget report, which reflects
the overall magnitude and volume of peacekeeping
operations and support. The Committee notes the
statement in paragraph 4 that “by 2002, the support
capacity at the United Nations Secretariat is reaching a
level where it can effectively backstop the current
volume of operations, address the needs of Member
States, and pay attention to such medium-term
organizational priorities as improving processes,
upgrading technology, training people, and changing
the organizational culture to enhance effectiveness and
efficiency”.

19. The overall resources under posts ($68,290,600)
include the establishment of the 24 additional support
account posts mentioned in paragraph 17 above,
namely, 12 in the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, 3 in the Medical Services Division, 6 in the
Information Technology Services Division, 1 in the
Procurement Division, and 2 in the Department of
Public Information. The Committee further notes that a
vacancy turnover factor of 8 per cent for Professional
staff and 2.5 per cent for General Service staff has been
applied in the costing exercise. The Committee is of
the opinion that an increase in workload should not
automatically lead to additional posts. In the first
instance, the increase should be accommodated
through increased productivity and efficiency
before a decision is made to request additional
posts.

20. The support account resources of the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations for the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003, which account for almost 77 per
cent of the overall resources, amount to $78,484,730 in
gross terms — an increase of $14,196,930 compared to
the appropriation for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30
June 2002 of $64,287,800 (see A/56/885, table 21).
The 12 additional posts proposed for the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations include the following: one
D-2 for a Director of Change Management (ibid., para.
15); two D-1 posts for an executive officer (para. 46)
and a Chief of the Communication and Information
Technology Service (para. 34); one P-5 for a Senior
Gender Adviser (para. 16); one P-4 for a Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration Adviser (para. 17);
seven General Service posts: four in the Office of
Operations (para. 22), one administrative assistant
within the Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit (para. 18)
and two administrative assistants in the Executive
Office (para. 47).

21. The Committee was informed that of the 533
currently approved posts for the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations (332 Professional and 201
General Service), as of March 2002 there were 64
vacancies (58 Professional and 6 General Service).

22. As to the recruitment to fill the 91 additional
posts approved under resolution 56/241 for the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the
Committee was informed that 58 posts were occupied
as at 27 March 2002: 23 “permanently” encumbered
after completion of established recruitment procedures
(8 Professional and 15 General Service) and 35
“temporarily” occupied, pending completion of the
established recruitment exercises (25 Professional and
10 General Service).

23. The Committee recalls that, in a previous
report (A/56/478), it recommended approval of the
proposed D-2 post for the Director of Management.
The Committee maintains its recommendation, in
the context of the position set out in that report
(para. 28). The Committee also recommends
approval of the proposal to establish a P-4 post for
the Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration Adviser, in view of the need for a
focal point in the Department, which is solely
responsible for such activities in peacekeeping
operations, and of the General Service post
proposed in the Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit.
As to the two D-1 posts proposed (executive officer
and Chief of the Communication and Information
Technology Service), the Committee remains
unconvinced of the need for the posts at that level,
as it has previously indicated (A/56/478, paras. 34
and 56). Neither is it convinced of the need for the
four General Service posts in the Office of
Operations. However, the Committee does
recommend approval of one of the two General
Service posts proposed for the Executive Office.

24. The Committee exchanged views with the
representatives of the Secretary-General as to the
functions or role of the P-5 post proposed for a Senior
Gender Adviser in the Peacekeeping Best Practices
Unit. The Committee is of the opinion that no adequate
rationale for the post has been advanced, given that a
more coherent policy in this regard is still to be
developed (see A/56/478, para. 33). Under the
circumstances, the Committee does not recommend
acceptance of the proposal to establish the P-5 post
for the Senior Gender Adviser.



5
A/56/941

25. The Committee recalls requesting that additional
information on extrabudgetary resources to support the
activities of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations be clearly identified and disclosed in future
cost estimates, such as those related to the
Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit, the Mine Action
Service or training assistance (A/55/882, para. 13).
This was found lacking in the presentation. The
Committee reiterates its request for future
submissions.

26. In this connection, the Committee notes, that for
the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003, the Mine
Action Service has 19 approved posts (14 Professional
and 5 General Service) funded under the Voluntary
Trust Fund, in addition to 5 authorized support account
posts (4 Professional and 1 General Service). Upon
enquiry, the Committee was further informed that
estimated expenditure for the period, partly dependent
upon the availability of funds contributed by donors, is
estimated at $15 million. These expenditures fund the
totality of activities of the Mine Action Service only.
Programmes relating to mine operations are funded
from extrabudgetary resources within field missions.

27. As to the Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit, the
Committee notes that the additional staffing and
resources approved for the Unit have reduced the
dependence on voluntary contributions. The Unit
currently has eight support account authorized posts (7
Professional and 1 General Service) and, as indicated
in paragraph 20 above, three additional posts (1 P-5 for
a Senior Gender Adviser, 1 P-4 for a Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration Adviser and 1
General Service) are currently being requested (see the
Committee’s recommendations in paras. 23 and 24
above). However, the Unit still continues to benefit
from contributions to the Trust Fund and, on the basis
of the current fund balance, estimated related
expenditures are expected to approximate $412,000.

28. The non-post costs proposed for the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations for the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 are estimated at $15,453,730 —
an increase of $5,862,030 over the amount of
$9,591,700 appropriated for the period 2001-2002. The
Committee notes, as shown in table 21 of the report,
that the increase is mostly due to additional resources
under general operating expenses ($4,056,600) and
training ($1,767,000).

29. The resources proposed for training in the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations include
$200,000 under non-staff costs of the Executive Office
for staff training (see A/56/885, para. 52); a first time
provision for $694,500 for the Personnel Management
and Support Service (see para. 29 and table 10); and
$1,753,000 for the training activities of the Training
and Evaluation Service of the Military Division (see
para. 42). The Committee notes that the Civilian
Training Section in the Personnel Management and
Support Service oversees policy in the area of training
at both Headquarters and the missions. The Committee
was informed that a training catalogue was being
finalized, which would be available electronically
where possible, otherwise in hard copy, as well as
systems for the monitoring and evaluation of these
activities. The Committee welcomes these
developments.

30. The Committee further notes that the total
proposed resources for training programmes in the
support account for 2002-2003 amount to $3,035,500
($2,647,500 for the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, $295,000 for the Department of
Management, $90,000 for the Office of Internal
Oversight Services, and $3,000 for the Office of Legal
Affairs) and that those proposed in the budgets of the
different missions amount to $4,042,200, making a
total of $7,077,700. The Committee has referred to the
issue of training in its report on the administrative and
budgetary aspects of the financing of the United
Nations peacekeeping operations (see A/56/887, paras.
74-75) and its first report on the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/7, para.
VIII.35). Given the significant and increasing
amounts being spent on training related to
peacekeeping operations, the Committee is of the
opinion that the time has come for the Secretariat to
develop a methodology and monitoring system to
evaluate the results of that training in peacekeeping
and related areas, as well as to increase its
effectiveness by making it more mission-specific,
where appropriate. The outcome of this exercise
should be provided in the context of the submission
of budgets for peacekeeping operations for the
period 2003-2004. Based on the above, a
methodology could also be developed to arrive at
proposals for the training requirements to be
included in future budget submissions.

A/56/941

31. As to the costs associated with general operating
expenses, the Committee notes from table 2 of the
budget report that overall support account resources for
this item amount to $8,170,600 — a decrease of
$3,053,950 compared to the provision included for
2001/2002. The Committee also notes that the related
provision for the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations shows an increase from $2,119,600 in
2001/2002 to $6,176,200, while that of the Department
of Management shows a decrease from $9,055,850 to
$1,588,700 in view of the fact that the provision for
rental of premises, previously contained in the resource
requirements of that Department, is now allocated to
the respective departments or offices. As regards
available space for the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, the Committee notes the amount of
$4,631,200 indicated (A/56/885, para. 48) for the rental
of premises for the Department, based on standard
costs. The Committee has repeatedly referred to the
issue of space allocation (see A/55/882, para. 25, and
A/56/7, para. VIII.78). The Committee regrets that
no information was presented in the current
submission and requests that such an assessment be
included in the context of the support account
submission for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30
June 2004.

32. As shown in table 29 of the Secretary-General’s
report, requirements of $403,500 are proposed for the
Department of Public Information. This represents 0.4
per cent of the overall support account resources. No
support account resources have been provided until
now to the Department although there are 289 public
information staff (85 Professional, 41 General Service,
156 local, 2 national officers and 5 United Nations
Volunteers) in different peacekeeping missions (see the
annex to the present report). The proposed provision
includes $251,200 for posts, in view of the request for
two P-4 posts for two information officers that would
provide planning and operational support to the public
information components of approximately eight
missions.

33. The Committee welcomes the information
provided in annex II to the report (A/56/885) outlining
the division of responsibilities between the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of
Public Information. The Committee recalls that in its
report on the implementation of the report of the Panel
on United Nations Peace Operations (A/56/478, para.
32) it indicated that the Department of Public

Information should have a dedicated unit to identify
and implement public information programmes in
peacekeeping missions on the basis of objectives
tailored to the specific needs of the missions
concerned, but that the operational activities and
related programmes should be requested in the context
of each peacekeeping mission. The Committee referred
to the operational activities and related programmes in
its report on the administrative and budgetary aspects
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (see
A/56/887, para. 72). In view of the currently ongoing
comprehensive review of the management and
operations of the Department of Public
Information, requested by the General Assembly
(resolution 56/253 of 24 December 2001, para. 150)
and the anticipated submission of the related report
to the Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, the
Committee recommends delaying a decision on the
requested additional posts.

34. The support account resources proposed for the
Department of Management are summarized in table 43
of the Secretary-General’s report. The requirements of
$18,265,700, or 17.9 per cent of the overall support
account resources, reflect a decrease in resources of
$3,410,300 compared to the resources for 2001/2002.
This is mostly due to the decrease of $7,467,150 under
general operating expenses, as a result of the allocation
of the costs for the rental of premises, previously
allocated under the Department’s resources, to the
respective departments or offices. This decrease is
offset in part by an increase of $2,568,050 under posts
in view of the proposal to establish 10 new support
account posts (3 Professional and 7 General Service).

35. The Secretary-General is proposing to establish
three additional posts in the Office of Human
Resources: one P-4 post for a medical officer (see para.
95) and two General Service posts for nurses (para.
96). The Committee notes that the Medical Services
Division currently has an approved total of 28 posts
(14 regular budget posts, 10 extrabudgetary posts, 4
support account posts). The Committee does not see
the need for the additional medical officer.
However, the Committee recommends acceptance of
the proposal to establish the two additional posts
for nurses at the General Service level.

36. Paragraph 97 indicates a provision for $240,000
for non-post requirements for the Medical Services
Division related to general temporary assistance. The



7
A/56/941

Committee recommends acceptance of this
proposal.

37. Besides the maintenance of the funding for the
current number of 38 support account posts (19
Professional and 19 General Service), the Secretary-
General is proposing to provide 7 additional support
account posts to the Office of Central Support Services
(2 Professional and 5 General Service). An additional
P-3 post for a procurement officer is proposed in the
Procurement Division; a P-2 post is proposed for
Internet/Intranet support for missions (including IMIS);
and five General Service posts (principal level), to
support the wide area network and supporting satellite
links, are proposed in the Information Technology
Services Division (see paras. 105-107).

38. As regards the proposal for a P-3 procurement
officer post, while the Committee does not interpose
an objection, it recalls that it had requested
information on the structure and staffing of the
Procurement Division which has not been received.
The Committee recommends that approval of this
post by the General Assembly should be subject to
the submission to the Fifth Committee of the
requested information.

39. The Committee recommends acceptance of the
proposal to establish the P-2 and the five General
Service posts in the Information Technology
Services Division, which currently only has one P-2
support account post.

40. The action to be taken by the General
Assembly in connection with the financing of the
support account for the 12-month period from 1
July 2002 to 30 June 2003 are set out in section II of
the report (A/56/885).

41. In view of the recommendations made by the
Committee in paragraphs 23, 24, 33 and 35 above,
the Committee recommends that the General
Assembly approve total staffing and non-staffing
requirements of $100,554,780 gross ($86,865,780
net) for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June
2003. The Committee also recommends that the
miscellaneous income of $127,800 from the period
from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 be applied to the
resources required for the period from 1 July 2002
to 30 June 2003 and that the balance of
$100,426,980 gross ($86,737,980 net) be prorated
among the individual peacekeeping operation
budgets to meet the requirements of the support

account for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June
2003.
