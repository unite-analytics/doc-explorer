Unforeseen and extraordinary expenses

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on unforeseen and extraordinary
expenses (A/59/90). During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with
representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and
clarification.

2. The report of the Secretary-General was submitted pursuant to the request of
the Advisory Committee, in paragraph 9 of its report A/58/604, for a review by the
Secretariat of the adequacy of the provisions of the resolution on unforeseen and
extraordinary expenses relating to expenses certified by the President of the
International Court of Justice.

3. The current provisions, as adopted in paragraph 1 (b) of General Assembly
resolution 58/273 of 23 December 2003, are indicated in section II of the Secretary-
Generalâ€™s report (A/59/90). Section III provides a background analysis of the use of
the specific expenses and corresponding resource ceilings certified by the President
of the Court under the resolution on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses. The
Committee notes that no expenses or limited expenses have been certified against
the provisions identified in paragraphs 1 (b) (ii), on the calling of witnesses and the
appointment of experts, 1 (b) (iii), on the maintenance in office for the completion
of cases of judges who have not been re-elected, and 1 (b) (v), on the work of the
Court or its Chambers away from The Hague; no change is therefore proposed in the
current contingency ceilings of $50,000, $40,000 and $25,000, respectively. In
addition, no change is proposed at this time in regard to the provisions of paragraph
1 (b) (iv), on the payment of pensions and travel and removal expenses of retiring
judges and travel and removal expenses and installation grant of members of the
Court, for which the current contingency ceiling is set at $410,000, for the reasons
indicated in paragraph 12 of the report of the Secretary-General.

4. However, as to the provision regarding paragraph 1 (b) (i) of the resolution, on
the designation of ad hoc judges, for which the current ceiling has been set at



2
A/59/551

$330,000, the Committee notes the continuous use of the provision in the course of
recent years, as reflected in the table contained in paragraph 14 of the report of the
Secretary-General. The Committee was further informed that for 2004, as at
1 November, a total of 26 judges had been designated, as compared with 2 shown in
the table. Thus, additional charges may arise against the provision before the end of
the year. As indicated in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the report, in view of the
consistency in the use of this provision, the Secretary-General is proposing to
establish a continuing provision of $400,000 in the regular budget of the Court in
the context of the upcoming proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-
2007, while adjusting the ceiling under this component of the resolution on
unforeseen and extraordinary expenses from $330,000 to $200,000. On that basis,
the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly take note of
the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/90) and approve his proposal, as
reflected in section IV of that report.
