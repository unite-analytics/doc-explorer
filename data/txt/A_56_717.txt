Revised estimates resulting from the strengthening of the
role of internal oversight services at the International
Tribunals for the biennium 2002-2003

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the
Secretary-General on the revised estimates resulting
from the strengthening of the rule of the internal
oversight services at the International Tribunals for the
biennium 2002-2003 (A/C.5/56/30). During its
consideration of the report, the Committee met with
representatives of the Secretary-General.

2. The Advisory Committee points out that it is
unusual for a supplementary request to follow so
closely the initial estimates for the activity under
consideration and in the midst of discussion of the
initial estimates in the Fifth Committee. Under the

circumstances, the proper course of action would have
been to submit these proposals in the context of a
statement of programme budget implications of such
draft decision as the Fifth Committee might have made.

3. According to the report, the current oversight
services provided by the Office of Internal Oversight
Services to the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda are not optimal owing to a lack of adequate
resources. In order to address this situation, it is
proposed to expand oversight services at both
Tribunals by placing resident auditors at both The
Hague and Arusha. Initially, for the six-month period

A/56/717

from 1 January to 30 June 2002, additional
appropriations are requested in the amounts of
$167,550 and $219,850 under the biennial budgets for
2002-2003 for the International Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda respectively (ibid., paras. 2, 3 and
10).

4. The Secretary-General proposes a provision of
$300,400 under general temporary assistance
($123,050 for the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and $177,350 for the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda to cover the costs of six posts (4
P-4 and 2 P-3) for the first six months of 2002 for audit
and investigation services for both Tribunals. Three
posts (2 P-4 and 1 P-3) would be located at The Hague
and the other three (2 P-4 and 1 P-3) would be located
at Arusha (ibid., para. 4 and annex).

5. The Advisory Committee notes with concern the
significant disparity in the number of audit and
investigation days the Office of Internal Oversight
Services dedicated to the International Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda during the biennium 2000-2001.
The Office dedicated 128 days for the internal audit of
the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
and only 29 days for the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda. Similarly, with regard to
investigations, the Office dedicated 129 days for the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and
only 63 for the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (see ibid., para. 1). It should be recalled that
both the Advisory Committee and the Board of
Auditors have in the past, stressed the need to
formulate proper internal audit plans for the
Tribunals. The Committee requests that these
shortcomings in the planning of the audit work
programme for the International Tribunals be
addressed as a matter of priority.

6. The Advisory Committee notes that the amount
of $65,000 is requested to cover the costs of travel of
Headquarters-based auditors, investigators and
management consultants during the year (see ibid.,
para. 7). The Committee believes that savings should
arise under this category of expenditure with the
posting of resident auditors at The Hague and
Arusha and the use of the existing communication
infrastructure. These should be reported in the first
financial and programme performance reports for

the International Tribunals for the biennium 2002-
2003.

7. The Advisory Committee has no objection to
the proposed additional resources under general
temporary assistance to expand the internal audit
and investigation coverage at the Tribunals. The
Committee gave high priority to these matters
during its review of the budget estimates (see, for
example, A/55/642). The Committee requests,
however, that the issue of providing resources on a
continuing basis beyond the first six months of 2002
for audit and investigations under the biennial
budgets for the International Tribunals for 2002-
2003 be submitted in the context of the first
financial and programme performance report for
the Tribunals for the biennium 2002-2003 (see
A/56/665, para. 13, and A/56/666, para. 3).

8. Under the circumstances, the Advisory
Committee recommends that the General Assembly
approve the additional appropriations in the
amounts of $167,550 and $219,850 under the
biennial budgets for 2002-2003 for the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
respectively.
