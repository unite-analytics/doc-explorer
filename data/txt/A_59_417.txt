Proposed revised budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to
30 June 2005 of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2004/05

Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2004/05

$291,603,600

$291,603,600

1. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the full amount
proposed by the Secretary-General for UNAMSIL for the period from 1 July
2004 to 30 June 2005.

2. The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the
financing of UNAMSIL are listed at the end of the present report. The report also
incorporates the comments and observations of the Committee following its visit to
the Mission from 1 to 4 June 2004.

I. Introduction

3. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was established by
the Security Council in its resolution 1270 (1999) of 22 October 1999 for an initial
period of six months. The mandate of the Mission was subsequently extended
through successive Security Council resolutions until 30 September 2004. By its
resolution 1492 (2003) of 18 July 2003, the Security Council endorsed a plan for the
drawdown of UNAMSIL according to the “modified status quo” option envisaging
the complete withdrawal of troops by December 2004, as recommended by the
Secretary-General in his report of 23 June 2003 (S/2003/663). A revised drawdown
plan with a more gradual reduction in the military and police strength of UNAMSIL,
proposed by the Secretary-General in his report of 19 March 2004 (S/2004/228) was



2
A/59/417

approved by the Security Council in its resolution 1537 (2004) of 30 March 2004.
Recognizing the necessity for further strengthening of the capacity of the Sierra
Leone police and armed forces to maintain security and stability effectively, as
indicated in the Secretary-General’s twenty-third report on UNAMSIL
(S/2004/724), of 10 September 2004, the Security Council, by its resolution 1562
(2004) of 17 September 2004, extended the mandate of UNAMSIL for a further nine
months, until 30 June 2005.

4. The drawdown timetable described in the Secretary-General’s twenty-second
report on UNAMSIL (S/2004/526), of 6 July 2004, remains on track and it is
planned that by the end of December 2004 the number of troops will be reduced
from 11,500 to approximately 5,000, with some 1,500 military personnel providing
logistical support and a seamless transition to the Mission’s residual presence. By
the end of February 2005, it is expected that the force strength will be reduced to
3,250 troops and 141 United Nations military observers. The civilian staff will be
reduced concomitantly.

II. Information on performance for the current period

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 31 August 2004, a total of
$2,625.1 million had been assessed on Member States in respect of the Mission
since its inception. Payments received as at that date amounted to $2,489.1 million,
leaving an outstanding balance of $136.0 million. As at 20 September 2004, the
cash position of the Mission was $223.5 million and the unliquidated obligations for
the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 amounted to $55.9 million.

6. The Advisory Committee was informed that troop and formed police cost
reimbursement up to 30 April 2004 totalled $51,483,000, while the amount owed for
the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 August 2005 was $46,588,000. With regard to
contingent-owned equipment, the Committee was informed that as at 31 August
2004, an amount of $55,435,000 had been reimbursed and the estimated amount
owed was $859,000, while unliquidated obligations totalled $35,531,000. In respect
of death and disability compensation, $4,235,650 had been paid as at 31 August,
2004 for 99 claims; 14 claims were pending and unliquidated obligations amounted
to $15,883,000.

7. The Committee commends the Mission on its well-managed cash position
and notes with appreciation that all of the 69 memorandums of understanding
have been signed. It calls upon Headquarters to replicate these good practices
in other missions.

8. The Advisory Committee was informed that the delayed deployment factor as
at 31 August 2004 was 12 per cent for military observers, 18 per cent for military
contingents and 22 per cent for civilian police, and that the vacancy rate was 17 per
cent for international staff, 6 per cent for national staff and 14 per cent for United
Nations Volunteers.

III. Proposed revised budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to
30 June 2005

9. The initial budget for the operations of UNAMSIL for the period from 1 July
2004 to 30 June 2005 amounted to $196,982,200,1 based on the drawdown plan
envisaging a complete withdrawal of troops by December 2004.

10. The revised resource requirements for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June
2005 amount to $291,603,600, an increase of $94,621,400 or 48 per cent over the
initial apportionment (see A/59/286). This revised amount encompasses
$143,428,200 for military and police personnel, $50,413,100 for civilian
personnel and $97,762,300 for operational costs, respective increases of 29, 46 and
90 per cent, with air transportation accounting for 70 per cent of the increase in
operational costs.

11. As indicated in paragraph 4 above, the revised budget provides for the scaling
down of the Mission to 5,320 troops by December 2004 and subsequently from
1 January 2005 for an initial period of six months to a residual presence with a
ceiling of 3,250 troops, 141 military observers and 80 civilian police personnel.

12. Civilian personnel will also be reduced, initially down to 1,003 posts,
comprising 330 international staff, 534 national staff and 139 United Nations
Volunteers by December 2004, and further to a total of 849 posts, comprising 266
international staff, 486 national staff and 97 United Nations Volunteers by 30 April
2005.

A. Activities of the Mission related to liquidation

13. In its report on the financial performance report for the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 and the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to
30 June 2005 (A/58/759/Add.3) the Advisory Committee noted that property write-
off was not proceeding as well as could be expected, especially at the downsizing
stage of the Mission. It urged UNAMSIL to pay increased attention to the write-off
and disposal process and to ensure that those tasks were accomplished in full
compliance with the financial rules and procedures of the Organization.

14. The Committee was informed that following a thorough review of the asset
write-off and disposal process, an Assets Disposal Group and an Asset Disposal and
Environmental Protection Unit were established. The first is responsible for
resolving outstanding issues related to asset write-offs and disposal, whereas the
second ensures that all United Nations and contingent-owned assets are disposed of
in an environmentally friendly manner and that the Sierra Leone local authorities
issue a certificate of clearance indemnifying the Mission from environmental
liabilities in the areas evacuated. The lessons learned and experience acquired have
been integrated into guidelines, developed in close cooperation with the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), for the environmentally friendly disposal
of assets, which will become part of the standards applied by the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations in all missions.

1 Recommended by the Advisory Committee and approved by the General Assembly in its
resolution 58/308 of 18 June 2004.

A/59/417

15. The Committee understands that, at the end of February 2004, an assets
surplus of $40 million to be transferred to the United Nations Logistics Base or
other missions had been identified. It was informed that following the steps taken to
dispose of most of the written-off assets, there were 2,140 assets pending disposal
and 839 assets in the process of being written off as at 31 August 2004. The
Committee commends UNAMSIL for the progress made in this area.

16. The schedule of troop repatriation is established in close concert with
contributing countries, allowing for a certain flexibility with respect to actual
departure dates. Drawdown of military and police personnel is proceeding in
accordance with the adjustment drawdown and withdrawal plan. The Committee
was informed that the Mission plans to close 22 camps/team sites and repatriate
4,440 military personnel, while conducting rotations for 2,125 military personnel,
within the next three months.

17. The Committee notes that with the decrease in the number of troops, the levels
of the Force Commander and Deputy Force Commander have been downgraded
from ASG to D-2 and from D-2 to D-1, respectively.

A/59/417

18. The implementation of the adjustment drawdown and withdrawal plan has
created considerable additional tasks for the administrative component of the
mission. For example, the movement of a battalion from its existing location to the
port of departure for repatriation takes approximately one month, requiring
numerous activities such as the clean-up of existing camp sites/locations,
transportation of all contingent-owned equipment and military personnel to the
transit camps by road or air, maintenance and extension of transit camps, and
transportation of contingent-owned equipment and military personnel to the ports
for departure.

19. The Advisory Committee is concerned that the requirement for multiple
peacekeeping operations in the region, with the consequent competition for
experienced mission staff, together with the downsizing of UNAMSIL, have
precipitated an erosion of experienced staff away from UNAMSIL at a crucial point
in its operation. It is an important principle that sufficient experienced staff should
be retained in a mission that is downsizing to deal with assets disposal and the
handover of programmes to the Government and other entities in the country, as
well as to properly document lessons learned. The Committee understands the
urgency entailed in setting up new peacekeeping operations and the career
development concerns of the staff assigned to missions which are winding up;
however, it strongly recommends that the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations assign greater priority to ensuring that adequate numbers of
experienced staff are available to carry out winding up activities efficiently and
effectively and that guidelines be established to strengthen existing lessons-
learned efforts.

20. The Committee welcomes the efforts made to align the grade levels of a
variety of posts to the reduced workload of the downsized mission.

D. Operational costs

1. Training

21. The Committee notes the extensive training programmes available to the
staff of this downsizing mission; some courses attended seem to be more suited
to the start-up phase of peacekeeping missions. In certain cases, the training is
conducted in Geneva, New York or Brindisi, undoubtedly entailing additional
travel costs. It is the Committee’s opinion that the training programmes offered
should be related to the operational needs of the downsized Mission; the
Committee requests the Mission to make a careful assessment of the training
needed by staff to accomplish their tasks. In this connection, it understands
that training programmes for strengthening the capacity of national staff may
be planned and executed at all stages of a mission, including and especially in
the downsizing phase.

22. Moreover, the Committee recognizes that the question of staff training is
also a broader, cross-cutting issue that cannot be resolved at the level of a
particular mission. It should be addressed in an integrated manner, with a
systematic recording of the training programmes attended by each staff
member, on the one hand to ensure that staff members do not undergo the same
training multiple times and on the other to facilitate search for specific skills.
The Committee has requested the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to
prepare proposals for an in-depth discussion on all matters related to staff
training in February 2005.

A/59/417

2. Transportation

23. The Committee underlines the importance of monitoring the ratio of vehicles
to the number of personnel with a view to maximizing cost savings, especially
during the downsizing phase of operations.

24. The Committee was informed that the increases in transportation costs,
especially air transportation, are due to the increased number of aircraft in
operation. This is to some extent attributable to the new safety policy of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations which prohibits travel of passengers on
cargo helicopters, but also, in part, to the increased activity related to troop
repatriation and the impossibility of ground access to many areas during the rainy
season. To comply with this policy, the Mission has received four new MI-8
helicopters for carrying passengers and repatriated one MI-26 helicopter, with a net
annual increase in operating costs of $6.9 million.

3. Standard ratios

25. The Committee commends the Mission for applying ratios based on real,
mission-tested costs, deviating from institutional standards, and thereby
producing a more realistic budget and avoiding overbudgeting. For example, the
requirement for petrol, oil and lubricants was established based on the effective
local price of $0.33 instead of the standard benchmark price of $0.5, as well as on a
more realistic estimate of the consumption of fuel per vehicle per day. The
Committee requests the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to extend this
practice to other missions.

E. Cooperation

26. The Committee noted the widespread cooperation, on a day-to-day basis,
between UNAMSIL and the other United Nations peacekeeping missions in Western
Africa, namely the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (ONUCI) and the
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in areas relating to administration and
logistics, training, military operations, political and civilian affairs, civilian police
operations, human rights and child protection, humanitarian affairs and public
information. As the oldest mission in the region, and having acquired expertise and
experience, UNAMSIL is able to provide support to the other missions, particularly
in the start-up phase.

27. For example, in the area of administration and logistics, the three missions
have assisted each other by sharing critical equipment, aircraft and specialized staff
and extending medical assistance. With regard to civilian police operations,
UNAMSIL sent a civilian police officer for a two-week assessment mission to
Liberia, provided material on training, organized a workshop and set up mechanisms
for joint planning and sharing of information concerning cross-border security
issues. Discussions on areas of common interest, such as planning for the return of
refugees or lessons learned on child protection, take place regularly. UNAMSIL has
also assisted in the preparation of workshops and provided briefings in the areas of
humanitarian affairs and human rights to the military leadership prior to their
deployment in Liberia.

28. Among the formal links instituted are meetings between the Special
Representatives of the Secretary-General, which provide a forum for assessing
political and security developments in the subregion, and quarterly meetings



7
A/59/417

between the three Force Commanders, which are coordinated by an interregional
secretariat.

29. On the military front, links have been established between staff officers at
various levels and regular exchanges of information and assessments take place.
UNAMSIL and UNAMIL have exchanged Liaison Officers, jointly patrol the border
with Liberia and review the threat on a daily basis. The Committee was informed
that the missions are also working closely together on the crucial issue of the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, which was
initially targeted for completion by March 2004. The continuing presence of some
800 ex-combatants in Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia is considered to be a potential
source of danger and destabilization, not only for Sierra Leone, but for the region.
The Committee urges the Mission to pursue this matter diligently.

30. There is also extensive cooperation between the Mission and agencies in the
area. The Advisory Committee was pleased to note the spirit of cooperation among
the entities involved in the Sierra Leone country team and the sense that was
conveyed of a common goal. The agencies are already working hand in hand in such
areas as resettlement of displaced persons, refugees, disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration, child protection, small arms, immunization campaigns, youth and
jobs for youth, and are poised to take over many UNAMSIL programmes once the
Mission withdraws. The Committee was informed that the World Bank, for example,
had committed itself to a three-year plan for the development of infrastructure at
$70 million per year. However, funding, in general, is scarce; the Committee was
informed that the recent United Nations inter-agency appeal yielded only 10 per
cent of the funding goal of $60 million.

31. During the visit of the Advisory Committee, the country team expressed its
recognition that the needs for recovery and the transition to sustainable development
in Sierra Leone go well beyond the means of any individual agency and called for
multi-dimensional partnerships with the Government, the United Nations, United
Nations agencies and other humanitarian and development partners. The Committee
was informed that at the beginning stages of international involvement in Sierra
Leone, emergency funding was plentiful for non-governmental organizations, which
began to initiate generous projects. After UNAMSIL was established, emergency
funding for non-governmental organizations dried up to some extent and the
organizations began to close down activities and withdraw from Sierra Leone,
causing some social tension and disruption of services. The Committee stresses
that the exit strategy should be smooth and, to that end, it should be
coordinated by UNAMSIL and involve all concerned agencies and non-
governmental organizations, as well as the Government.

32. With regard to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Committee notes with
interest the extent of current cooperation, and encourages the Mission to further
strengthen its collaboration with the Court to the extent possible during the
remainder of the Mission’s mandate. In December 2002, a memorandum of
understanding was signed clarifying the terms of cooperation between the Court and
UNAMSIL. It was reported to the Committee that UNAMSIL support had been
crucial in the field of security and that the Court continued to depend on UNAMSIL
helicopter assets for the movement of personnel to and from the interior of the
country to conduct investigations, visits to witnesses and outreach programmes.
UNAMSIL also provided other logistical support to the Court on a reimbursable
basis. In the opinion of the Committee, greater effort could have been made to



8
A/59/417

create joint services in areas such as personnel, information technology, finance and
procurement to avoid the establishment of separate units within the Court.

F. Quick-impact projects

33. While in Sierra Leone, the Advisory Committee visited the sites of two quick-
impact projects involving the building of schools by Ghanaian military personnel. In
the Committee’s view, these projects, which are modest in scope and cost, are
useful, not only for the communities concerned, but also because of the good public
relations they foster among all participants. Furthermore, they give an additional
constructive task to military contingents. In this connection, the Committee notes
that the projects it visited had been under implementation during the downsizing
phase, rather than in the start-up phase, as was envisaged in the report of the Panel
on United Nations Peace Operations (the Brahimi report) (see A/55/305-S/2000/809,
para. 47 (a)).

34. It is the view of this Committee that quick-impact projects could be useful
beyond the initial stages of a mission when they contribute to the implementation of
the mission’s mandate by fostering good relations between the military contingents
and the local population. Care must be taken, however, to avoid bureaucratization,
as the advantage of these projects lies in the flexibility with which they are planned
and implemented, as well as their low cost. The experience with these projects
should be sufficient, at this point, to draw educated lessons.

35. The Committee therefore recommends that the General Assembly
consider the issue with a view to extending the funding for quick-impact
projects beyond the initial stages of missions. To assist this consideration, the
Committee further recommends that the Secretariat work towards developing a
model that would draw on lessons learned and that would not involve the
establishment of rigid financial arrangements, which could render such
projects more costly and impede their quick implementation.

Radio UNAMSIL

36. One entity that bears special mention following the Committee’s visit to the
Mission is Radio UNAMSIL. Its coverage includes most of the country and it is, in
fact, the first national broadcasting medium, providing the people with unbiased
reporting and an outlet for voicing opinion through its many phone-in programmes.
Radio UNAMSIL also broadcasts targeted radio programmes, such as the Voice of
Children, which is currently airing 12 programmes on three radio stations
nationwide, with some 200 children involved as producers, presenters and
researchers. The Committee understands that Radio UNAMSIL was instrumental in
galvanizing the people for the elections and expects that it will continue to play an
important role as UNAMSIL draws down and the Special Court begins its trial
phase.

IV. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

37. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of UNAMSIL for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 is indicated in
paragraph 25 of the revised budget (A/59/286). Taking into account its comments
above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Assembly approve the
Secretary-General’s proposals.
