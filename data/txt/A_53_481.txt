According to the Secretary-General, the deployment of 1,050
troops, 35 military observers and 26 civilian police will be
completed by November 1998; the deployment of 68
international staff and 135 locally recruited staff will be
completed by January 1999. Annex IV to the report of the
Secretary-General (A/53/437) contains the deployment
schedule of military and civilian personnel.
6. In addition to the increase in troops from 750 to 1,050,
the proposed staffing for the Force reflects a reduction of 4
posts in the category of international staff and an increase of
18 posts in the category of locally recruited staff, thus
bringing the total number of the civilian component of
UNPREDEP to the previous level of 203 posts. Details of the
revised staff requirements are contained in paragraphs 14 to
26 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/53/437).
7. The Committee notes from paragraphs 15 and 25 of the
same report that the Secretary-General proposes to upgrade
the post of the Chief of the Civilian Engineering Section to
the P-3 level and the post of the Chief Finance Officer to the
P-4 level. The Committee was informed that these proposals
reflect a reinstatement of the staffing levels that existed before
the reduction in the military component of the Force took
place. While, under the circumstances, the Committee has no
objection to the proposed upgradings, it points out that 12. The Advisory Committee was also informed that
requests for reclassification of posts should normally be made expenditures for the fiscal year 1997/98 amounted to $39.6
in the context of initial budgets. million gross, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $6.9
8. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 18 of
the report that one Field Service post for an Air Operations
Manager is being proposed for the Movement Control/Air
Operations Unit, in order to implement the recommendation
of the Office of Internal Oversight Services that measures be
taken to strengthen the capability of the Organization to
assess the viability and suitability of a vendor, including
safety records and compliance with international safety
regulations. Although the Committee does not object to the
proposal at the present time, it requests that the need for the
functions of an Air Operations Manager be reviewed in the
context of the next budget proposal for UNPREDEP, if any.
9. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
deployment status of military and civilian personnel of
UNPREDEP as at 31 August 1998 was as follows:

Category of personnel Authorized Actual Incumbency rate
(percentage)

Military observers 35 35 100
Military contingents 1 050 655 62
Civilian police 26 26 100
International staff 72 64 89
Local staff 117 102 87

10. As can be seen from the table above, the deployment
of military contingents is only at the level of 62 per cent. In
this connection, the Advisory Committee was informed that,
in respect of one battalion, a memorandum of understanding
had not been signed as at 29 September 1998. Taking into
account the above statistics, as well as historical data on troop
deployment, the Advisory Committee is doubtful whether the
deployment schedule referred to in paragraph 5 above could
be fully implemented.
11. The Committee was informed that full reimbursement
for troops has been made to troop-contributing countries for
the period ending 31 December 1997 and that an amount of
$6.5 million is owed to troop-contributing countries for the
period ending 31 August 1998.

million; moreover, the expenditures of $39.6 million include
unliquidated obligations of about $14.4 million. The
Committee points out that some of the unliquidated obligation
may well be cancelled, which would further increase the
unencumbered balance for the financial period 1997/98. The
Committee is of the view that additional efforts need to be
taken to improve the reliability of budget estimates for
UNPREDEP. In this connection, the Advisory Committee
recalls that in the course of its consideration of the
performance report for UNPREDEP for the period from 1
July 1996 to 30 June 1997, the Committee observed that the
Secretary-General’s initial budget estimates for UNPREDEP
for that period appear to have been inflated (see
A/52/860/Add.1, para. 5).
13. The Advisory Committee was informed that out of the
total estimated requirements of $34.4 million for the
reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment from the
inception of UNPREDEP (1 January 1996) to 30 June 1999,
an amount of $3.0 million has been reimbursed to troop-
contributing countries. In this connection, the Advisory
Committee recalls that in paragraphs 9 to 12 of its previous
report on the financing of UNPREDEP during the financial
period 1998/99 (A/52/860/Add.1), the Committee made a
number of observations and recommendations. For example,

the Committee noted that the requirements for reimbursement
of contingent-owned equipment were based on the retroactive
application of the new wet-lease arrangements to the
inception of UNPREDEP on 1 January 1996 (ibid., para. 9).
Moreover, the Committee observed that, “at this stage the
capacity of the Organization to implement the new
contingent-owned equipment arrangements and to benefit
from them is deficient” and it recommended, therefore, that
“the Secretary-General take all necessary measures
adequately to review projected requirements for
reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment under the new
wet-lease arrangements, including an immediate special audit
by the Board of Auditors on this issue, which would, inter
alia, address arrangements in place for application of the new
contingent-owned equipment procedures” (ibid., para. 10).
The Advisory Committee also pointed out that it is important
that “the Secretary-General clarify and confirm that
reimbursement under the new wet-lease arrangements with
troop-contributing Governments does not include provisions
for support and services already provided by the United
Nations to military personnel” (ibid., para. 12). The Advisory
Committee points out that the above observations and
recommendations still need to be addressed by the Secretary-
General.
14. The Secretary-General, in paragraph 27 of his report
(A/53/437), proposes that the General Assembly appropriate
$34.4 million gross for the maintenance and liquidation of
UNPREDEP during the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June
1999, in addition to the amount of $21.0 million gross already
appropriated and assessed under General Assembly resolution
52/245. Taking into account its comments and observations
in the paragraphs above, the Advisory Committee
recommends that the General Assembly appropriate an
amount of $29.0 million gross for a total amount of $50.0
million gross for the Force for the financial period from 1 July
1998 to 30 June 1999. The assessment of the additional
amount of $29.0 million gross would be subject to the
renewal of the mandate of UNPREDEP by the Security
Council for the period beyond 28 February 1999.
