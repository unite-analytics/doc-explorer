Financing of the activities arising from
Security Council resolution 687 (1991):
United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission

Financing of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait
Observation Mission

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on interim financing of the United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) for the four-month period
from 1 July to 31 October 2003 (A/57/811). During its consideration of the report,
the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided
additional information and clarifications.

2. At its winter session in 2003, the Advisory Committee had before it a proposed
budget for UNIKOM for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. However,
owing to the circumstances prevailing in the region, the basis for the formulation of
that budget was no longer relevant, and the Committee decided not to issue a report
on UNIKOM at that time, but to revert to the matter when the situation had been
clarified (see A/57/772, para. 6).

3. The Advisory Committee recalls that in April 2003 the Security Council
concurred with the recommendation of the Secretary-General that UNIKOM should
be maintained for a further three months until 6 July 2003, by which date the
Council would review the question again (see S/2003/400). As indicated in
paragraph 3 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/57/811), pending a decision by
the Security Council on the future of UNIKOM, interim financing arrangements will
be required for the four-month period from 1 July to 31 October 2003. During that
period, a revised budget proposal for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 is
to be prepared for submission to the General Assembly for its review during the
main part of its fifty-eighth session.

4. In paragraph 5 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/57/811), the General
Assembly is requested to appropriate the amount of $12 million for the four-month

period from 1 July to 31 October 2003, including the amount of $8 million,
representing two thirds of the cost, to be funded through voluntary contributions
from the Government of Kuwait, and to apportion the amount of $4 million among
Member States.

5. During its meeting with the representatives of the Secretary-General, the
Advisory Committee was informed that the existing cash available in the UNIKOM
Special Account was $46.2 million as at 14 May 2003. Under the circumstances, the
Committee recommends that, in lieu of an appropriation, commitment authority be
granted to use the available cash balance to cover the requirements for the
maintenance of the Mission for the four-month period from 1 July to 31 October
2003.

6. The Advisory Committee stated its intention, in paragraph 6 of its report of
4 April 2003 (A/57/772), to issue a report on the Secretary-Generalâ€™s performance
report for UNIKOM for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (A/57/665)
before the end of May 2003 together with recommendations on how to deal with
requirements for the period after 1 July 2003. However, in view of the fact that a
revised budget proposal is to be submitted to the General Assembly at the main part
of its fifty-eighth session, the Committee will issue its report on the financial
performance report in conjunction with its report on the revised budget.
