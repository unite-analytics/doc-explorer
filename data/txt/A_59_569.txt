Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2004/05 $21 789 400

Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2004/05 $21 789 400

1. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the full amount
proposed by the Secretary-General for the United Nations advance team in the
Sudan for the 90-day period from 11 September to 10 December 2004.

2. The documentation used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the
financing of the United Nations advance team in the Sudan is listed at the end of the
present report.

I. Introduction

3. The United Nations advance team in the Sudan was established as a special
political mission pursuant to Security Council resolution 1547 (2004) of 11 June
2004 for the initial period of three months from 11 June to 10 September 2004. An
amount of $16,636,600 was approved for the initial phase of the mission, of which
an amount of $15,638,000 has been spent and $998,600 remains unencumbered.

4. The resource requirements of the mission for the initial period were met
through utilization of the provision for special political missions under section 3,
Political affairs, of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 for which the
General Assembly had appropriated $169,431,700 by its resolution 58/271 of
23 December 2003. To date a total of $166,429,100 has been charged against the



2
A/59/569

provision for special political missions under section 3 of the programme budget for
2004-2005, leaving an unassigned balance of $3,002,600. Upon request, the
Advisory Committee was provided with a list of charges against the amount
appropriated (see annex I to the present report).

5. In paragraph 15 of its resolution 1556 (2004) of 30 July 2004, the Security
Council extended the mandate of the advance team for a period of 90 days to
10 December 2004 and requested the Secretary-General to incorporate into the
mission contingency planning for the Darfur region. Accordingly, total requirements
of the United Nations advance team for the 90-day period up to 10 December 2004
in the Sudan are estimated at $21,789,400 gross ($21,008,100 net). It is proposed
that the total cost of the mission be met by utilizing the unencumbered balance of
the initial phase of the mission amounting to $998,600 and the unassigned balance
in the amount of $3,002,600 under section 3, Political affairs, and by appropriating,
under the procedures provided for in paragraph 11 of annex I to General Assembly
resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986, the remaining requirements of $17,788,200
gross ($17,006,900 net) (A/59/534, para. 4).

6. As indicated in paragraph 1 of Security Council resolution 1547 (2004), the
United Nations advance team in the Sudan is dedicated to preparation of the
international monitoring foreseen in the Framework Agreement on Security
Arrangements during the Interim Period, signed at Naivasha, Kenya, on
25 September 2003 (see S/2003/934, annex), to facilitate contacts with the parties
concerned and to prepare for the introduction of a peace support operation following
the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement.

7. In paragraph 4 of the same resolution, the Security Council also requested the
Secretary-General to take the necessary steps, including, in particular,
pre-positioning the most critical logistical and personnel requirements to facilitate
the rapid deployment of a possible peace support operation to assist in the
monitoring and verifying compliance with the terms of the comprehensive peace
agreement. Pursuant to section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of
23 December 1994, the Advisory Committee, upon request, authorized the
Secretary-General to enter into commitments not exceeding $49,999,400 for the
start-up of a possible peacekeeping operation.

8. The Advisory Committee was informed that the expenditure against the pre-
mandate commitment authority mentioned in paragraph 7 above amounts to
$28 million. These expenditures relate to 15 military liaison officers, 1 civilian
police officer and 39 international and 43 national staff, and other operational costs,
including reimbursement to the United Nations Mission in Liberia for the purchase
of vehicles, pre-fabricated facilities, generators, geographic information systems,
field defence supplies, information and communication technologies equipment and
air transportation.

9. In the paragraphs below, the Advisory Committee discusses the requirements
of the United Nations advance team in the Sudan to be funded as a special political
mission as indicated in paragraph 5 above.

II. Cost estimates for the period from 11 September to
10 December 2004

10. The requirements for the United Nations advance team in the Sudan, estimated
in the amount of $21,789,400 gross ($21,008,100 net), would provide for the
following:

A. Military and police personnel

11. The cost of 10 military liaison officers is estimated at $187,100 and 4 civilian
police advisers at $88,800. All military liaison officers have been deployed (see
A/59/534, para. 13).

B. Civilian personnel

12. Civilian personnel costs consisting of the salaries and common staff costs of
419 positions are estimated at $5,109,800. The 419 positions would comprise 204
positions for the core mandate of the mission (185 existing positions and 19
additional positions) and 215 new positions for the contingency planning for Darfur.
The 19 new positions for the core mandate of the mission comprise 5 Field Service
and 14 Local level staff for increased safety and security coverage of the missionâ€™s
personnel and property, including a warehouse complex at Khartoum airport where
the mission is storing large volumes of supplies and equipment and other facilities
(see A/59/534, paras. 13 and 14 and table 1).

13. The Advisory Committee was informed that, based on the deployment
schedule, vacancy factors of 34.6 per cent have been applied to the international
staff costs estimates and 45.3 per cent to national staff costs estimates. The
Committee was provided with the organization chart of the mission, showing the
preliminary, indicative distribution of posts among the organizational units of the
mission (see annex II to the present report).

14. The requirements for the Darfur component of the mission are estimated at
$12,785,200 gross ($12,552,300 net) (A/59/534, para. 14). The Advisory Committee
was informed that for the Darfur component, 215 staff positions would be required,
comprising: (a) 16 positions for additional substantive work in the areas of political,
civil and human rights affairs; (b) 156 positions for the establishment of five field
offices; (c) 9 positions for liaison with the African Union; and (d) 34 positions for
requirements for central and administrative support services. The Darfur field
offices would be staffed by a team of 79 substantive and 77 administrative and
support personnel. The Committee was provided with detailed information on the
proposed distribution of staffing resources in the five field offices.

15. The Advisory Committee was informed that the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, in his capacity as the designated official, planned to strengthen
the security structure of the mission in the light of the expansion of the mandate and
the corresponding increases in staff and geographical areas of coverage. In order to
assist him in this task and to ensure the regular, timely and fully integrated flow of
information on security incidents and trends, a D-1 position for an assistant
designated officer is requested for his office. The incumbent would oversee a fully



4
A/59/569

integrated system of security clearance, the tracking of staff movements, evacuation
planning and security training.

16. The Advisory Committee was informed that pursuant to paragraph 16 of
Security Council resolution 1556 (2004), in order to provide liaison with the African
Union and to assist it with planning and assessment for its mission in Darfur, the
mission would establish a liaison office at Addis Ababa headed by a D-1 senior
liaison officer with eight other staff positions (1 P-5 senior military planning officer,
1 P-4 military planning officer, 1 P-4 civilian police planning and liaison officer,
1 P-4 logistics officer, 1 P-3 reporting officer, 1 Field Service administrative
assistant and 2 Local level staff for drivers). The Committee was further informed
the African Union was also planning to appoint its envoy to Khartoum. The
Committee trusts that there will be maximum cooperation with the existing United
Nations presence in Addis Ababa, including the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea.

C. Operational costs

17. Total operational costs are estimated at $15,622,400, comprising: (a) official
travel of staff ($435,700); (b) facilities and infrastructure ($4,987,600); (c) ground
transportation ($1,681,600); (d) air transportation ($3,316,800); (e) communications
($2,748,000); (f) information technology ($1,191,500); (g) medical ($561,000);
(h) miscellaneous supplies, services and equipment ($450,200); and (i) quick impact
projects ($250,000).

D. Other matters

18. The Advisory Committee was informed that the conclusion of a
comprehensive peace agreement at Naivasha remained a primary focus of the
mission; however, the incorporation of Darfur has added a significant operational
and political dimension to the mission, bringing it closer to a peace support
operation. If a peacekeeping operation is authorized by the Security Council for the
Sudan, the mission would be an integrated complex mission, with a large
humanitarian component. It is expected that the United Nations funds and
programmes and its specialized agencies will be working closely with the mission.
The Committee understands that an inter-agency team is already being assembled.
The Committee was informed that the revised amount for the consolidated appeal
for the Sudan assistance programme is $711,351,694. This amount would cover the
humanitarian requirements for the Darfur crisis as well as humanitarian and
recovery needs for other parts of the Sudan, including those of internally displaced
persons returning to their homes in southern Sudan. Pledges and contributions
received to this date amount to $493,723,585 (or about 70 per cent of the
consolidated appeal). Fifteen agencies, funds, programmes and offices of the United
Nations are involved in the appeal (see annex III to the present report).

19. In paragraph 3 of its resolution 1556 (2004), the Security Council urged
Member States to reinforce the international monitoring team led by the African
Union, including the protection force, by providing personnel and other assistance,
including financing, supplies, transport, vehicles, command support,
communications and headquarters support as needed for the monitoring operations.

A/59/569

The Advisory Committee was informed that the African Union envisaged the
deployment of 3,320 personnel, including 2,341 military personnel. The Committee
was also informed that, as of 10 November 2004, there were a total of 746 African
Union military personnel deployed to Darfur. A total of nine donors have provided
assistance totalling $185,986,873 to the African Union for Darfur. Details of the
donors and amounts, as made available by the African Union, are provided in annex
IV to the present report.

20. The Advisory Committee was informed that the status of mission agreement
was signed with the Government in Khartoum. The Government would provide land
to build a United Nations house for common premises for the United Nations
operations in the Sudan under a 99-year lease arrangement. The agreement also
provides for an exemption from taxes and duties.

21. The Advisory Committee exchanged views with the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General on the structure of the mission in the Sudan. The preliminary
structure of the mission has been based on the standard template for complex,
integrated peacekeeping operations. The Committee was informed that the mission
structure would evolve from its present preliminary form in consonance with future
mandates for such peace support operation as might be decided by the Security
Council. In this connection, the Committee has consistently pointed to the need to
avoid top-heaviness and duplication. Should a proposed budget be presented, the
Committee will revert to the matter in the light of the report the Secretary-General is
to submit on the management structure of all peacekeeping operations (General
Assembly decision 59/507 of 29 October 2004).

III. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

22. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of the United Nations advance team in the Sudan for the period from
11 September to 10 December 2004 is indicated in paragraph 15 of the report of the
Secretary-General (A/59/534). Taking into account its comments above, the
Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve the
Secretary-Generalâ€™s proposals.
