 I. Introduction 
 
 

1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions would entail a reduction of $5,343,300 to the proposed 
budget for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 
1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (A/67/756/Add.1)2 (see sects. V and VI below). 

2. The Advisory Committee considered an advance version of the report of the 
Secretary-General on the proposed budget for the support account for peacekeeping 
operations for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (A/67/756) and related 
reports, including the report of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee on the 
budget of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) under the support 
account for 2013/14 (A/67/772), and a report submitted by OIOS on the 
implementation of the pilot project designated by the General Assembly in 
resolution 63/287 (A/67/751). The documents reviewed and those used for 
background by the Committee in its consideration of the financing of the support 
account are listed at the end of the present report. 

3. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Departments of 
Management, Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support had undertaken a joint 
review of the annual budget functions carried out at Headquarters in support of 
peacekeeping operations. Information with respect to the budget process review and 
adjusted resource requirements as a result of the review is contained in document 
A/67/756/Add.1. The Committee considered an advance version of the addendum. 

4. In section V.A of the present report, the Advisory Committee has made 
observations and recommendations on the post and non-post resources as proposed by 
the Secretary-General in document A/67/756. Section V.B of the present report 
contains comments and recommendations of the Committee on the budget process 
review and proposed resources related to the Field Budget and Finance Division of the 
Department of Field Support and the Peacekeeping Finance Division of the 
Department of Management (A/67/756/Add.1), as well as adjustments to the overall 
level of the resources proposed for the support account for 2013/14 as a result of the 
review. 

5. The report of the Advisory Committee on cross-cutting issues related to the 
United Nations peacekeeping operations is contained in document A/67/780. The 
Committee’s report on the report of the Board of Auditors on the United Nations 
peacekeeping operations for the period ended 30 June 2012 (A/67/5 (Vol. II)) is 
contained in document A/67/782. In the present report, the Committee deals with 
resources and other items that relate specifically to the support account for 
peacekeeping operations. 
 
 

 II. General considerations 
 
 

  Support account resource requirement level 
 

6. An overview of financial and human resources for peacekeeping operations 
(2008/09-2013/14) is provided in paragraph 21 of the proposed budget (A/67/756), 

__________________ 

 2 The overall resource level contained in document A/67/756 was adjusted in the addendum to the 
report (see A/67/756/Add.1).

which has been updated following the budget process review (see A/67/756/Add.1, 
annex). The Advisory Committee points out that, while the approved resource 
level for peacekeeping operations and UNSOA decreased from 2011/12 to 
2012/13, the combined resources proposed for the support account and UNLB 
represent 5.5 per cent ($378.2 million) of the proposed resources for 
peacekeeping missions and UNSOA for 2013/14, the highest level in absolute 
and relative terms in the past five budget cycles. 

7. In order to have a full picture of the total number of posts and positions 
requested under the support account, it is also necessary to consider the level of 
positions funded from general temporary assistance. In this regard, the Advisory 
Committee notes that, while the proposed number of posts for 2013/14 would 
increase from 1,294 to 1,328, the number of positions would decrease from 135 to 
75. Consequently, the total number of posts and positions requested in the support 
account would decrease from 1,429 for 2012/13 to 1,403 for 2013/14 
(A/67/756/Add.1, annex on human resources). In this connection, the Committee 
notes inconsistent presentation of posts and positions in the proposed budgets. For 
example, general temporary positions are included in the summary table for human 
resources for the proposed budget for 2013/14 (A/67/756, summary), whereas such 
information on positions was not included in the budget proposal for 2012/13 
(A/66/721, summary). In the view of the Committee, the Secretary-General 
should include both posts and positions under human resources requirements in 
the summary table in his future budget proposals. 

8. The Advisory Committee further notes that the Secretary-General has not 
presented comprehensive information on the total human resources allocated to 
support peacekeeping operations in his proposed budget. For example, there is no 
mention of post increases resulting from past reforms and initiatives, such as the 
restructuring and strengthening of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and 
the establishment of the Department of Field Support (see para. 9 and table below). 
Furthermore, no clear reference is made to the posts in the Departments of 
Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support funded under the regular budget, which 
were provided to the Committee, upon request, in a table for the support account 
budget for 2012/13 (see A/66/779, table 2). Moreover, in its consideration of the 
proposed budget for 2012/13, the Advisory Committee was provided, upon request, 
information on the number of civilian personnel supporting peacekeeping missions, 
which included posts funded from the support account and the regular budget, as 
well as posts/positions of UNLB (ibid., table 1.B). The Committee notes that such 
information continues to be unavailable in the current budget proposal for 2013/14. 
The Committee considers that the number of civilian personnel supporting 
peacekeeping operations has been presented in an inconsistent manner in the 
support account budget proposals that lacks transparency, thus making it 
difficult to render an appropriate and comparable analysis of human resources 
capacity over a longer period of time. 

9. The Advisory Committee requested annual statistics on the approved senior 
level posts (D-1 and D-2) funded under the support account from the time when the 
Department of Field Support was established, and such posts funded under UNLB 
(see table below). The table shows that the total D-1 and D-2 posts have increased 
from 5 and 13 for 2005/06 to 9 and 25 for 2012/13, respectively. The table also 
shows that, with the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
and the creation of the Department of Field Support, the number of senior level 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 6 
 

posts has increased from 15 for 2006/07 to 23 for 2007/08 in the two departments. 
The Committee notes from information provided to it that the total number of posts 
under the support account has increased from 819 for 2006/07 to 1,122 for 2007/08. 
The Committee further notes that five additional posts at the Director level are being 
requested in the proposed budget for 2013/14, consisting of: (a) two new posts  
(1 D-2/Department of Peacekeeping Operations and 1 D-1/OHCHR); (b) one 
reclassification (D-1 from P-5/Department of Field Support); and (c) two general 
temporary assistance conversions (D-1/OIOS) (see sect. V.A below).

 a Approved posts for the periods 2005/06 to 2012/13 and proposed posts for 2013/14. 
 
 

10. The General Assembly, in its resolution 66/265 on the support account, 
emphasized that support functions should be scalable to the size and scope of 
peacekeeping operations. In the same resolution, the Assembly reiterated its request 
to the Secretary-General to review the level of the support account on a regular 
basis, taking into consideration the number, size and complexity of peacekeeping 
operations. The Advisory Committee observes that, since the establishment of 
the peacekeeping support account, its resource level has been on an upward 
trend, with no measurable relation to the number, size and complexity of the 
peacekeeping operations. 

11. In the view of the Advisory Committee, there should be a relationship 
between the level of backstopping capacity provided through the support 
account and the overall scale of peacekeeping operation activities. The 
reporting on the backstopping of peacekeeping operations must also reflect the 
totality of resources available, including regular budget posts and non-post 
resources. The Secretary-General should, therefore, review the support account 
to determine how that relationship should be defined. This determination could 
thereby assist in the establishment of a baseline against which future requests 
for resources could be evaluated and the scalability of the support account can 
be achieved. 
 



 A/67/848

  Integrated operational teams  
 

12. Since the Secretary-General’s proposal to establish integrated operational 
teams in the context of the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations in 2007, the Advisory Committee has always advocated for greater 
flexibility in the utilization of the integrated operational teams in responding to the 
evolving needs of peacekeeping operations and for the efficient use of resources 
(see A/66/779, paras. 16-17). During its consideration of the budget for the support 
account for 2012/13, the Committee noted that the staffing of the teams had 
increased from the initial proposal of 49 by the Secretary-General to a total of  
107 posts and temporary positions approved under the regular budget and the 
peacekeeping support account, and that only one post for a Political Affairs Officer 
at the P-4 level in the Office of Operations had been abolished by the General 
Assembly, following the liquidation of MINURCAT (ibid., paras. 16 and 21). 

13. In this context, the Advisory Committee notes from the proposed budget for 
the support account for 2013/14 that, with the closure of UNMIT in 2012, the 
Secretary-General is proposing the following (see A/67/756, paras. 115-117): 

 (a) Of the three Political Affairs Officers who have supported UNMIT from 
the Asia Integrated Operational Team (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 1 P-3), to abolish the P-5 
post and to redeploy the P-4 and the P-3 posts to the West Africa and to the Middle 
East Integrated Operational Teams, respectively (see also sect. V.A below); 

 (b) To reduce the number of integrated operational teams from three to two 
in the Asia and Middle East Division by merging the Asia and UNAMA Integrated 
Operational Teams and maintaining the Middle East Integrated Operational Team. 

14. The Advisory Committee reiterates its view that the concept of integrated 
operational teams and its application should be kept under review and that its 
effectiveness should continue to be assessed in the light of experience gained 
and lessons learned. The Committee continues to hold the view that the number 
of integrated operational teams and the personnel capacity assigned to them to 
backstop peacekeeping missions should be adjusted to properly reflect changes 
in the overall level of peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, the Committee is 
not convinced of the need for integrated operational teams to support 
established or stable missions (see A/66/779, para. 24). 
 

  Presentation of the results-based-budgeting frameworks 
 

15. The Advisory Committee continues to believe that further refinement is 
required in order to improve the overall presentation of the results-based-budgeting 
frameworks in the proposed budget and performance reports of the support account, 
so that information contained in the frameworks will provide more clarity on the 
relevant operations of the departments/offices, as well as more accountability for 
those departments/offices concerned. The Committee’s comments on the results-
based-budgeting frameworks in peacekeeping operations are contained in its report 
on cross-cutting issues in peacekeeping (see A/67/780, sect. II). 
 

  Lessons learned and best practices of peacekeeping missions 
 

16. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly underlines, inter 
alia, the crucial importance of ensuring that the lessons learned and best practices of 
peacekeeping missions are adequately captured, processed and incorporated into 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 8 
 

guidelines and policies, and in this regard recognizes the significant role of the 
Policy and Best Practices Service of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
and best practices officers on the ground (see resolution 66/265, para. 18). 

17. The Advisory Committee requested information on the efforts made to 
implement the above-mentioned resolution. It was informed that the Policy and Best 
Practices Service, in coordination with field-based best practice officers, actively 
promoted the identification and capture of best practices and lessons learned. A total 
of 106 best practice documents and 19 system-wide guidance materials were 
generated from 1 July 2012 through 31 March 2013 (including the recent Second 
Generation Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Practices in Peace 
Operations, the document on Protection of Civilians Coordination Mechanisms in 
United Nations Peacekeeping Missions, the Civil Affairs Handbook, the Policy on 
United Nations Transitions: Mission Drawdown or Withdrawal and the policy on 
field occupational safety risk management). Further, the complete collection of 
peacekeeping best practice material and guidance was maintained in the policy and 
practice database available to all field and Headquarters staff through the peace 
operations intranet. The usefulness of the materials and access to the database was 
evidenced by the demand: in 2013 alone, those materials were downloaded over 
29,000 times by staff in the field and at Headquarters. The Advisory Committee 
welcomes the efforts made and progress achieved in the identification and 
incorporation of lessons learned and best practices into guidelines and policies 
for peacekeeping operations. 
 

  Representation of troop-contributing countries in peacekeeping staffing 
 

18. The Advisory Committee notes from the information provided to it that as at 
February 2013, the percentage of staff from troop- and police-contributing countries 
working in the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support has 
remained essentially at the same level compared with the number of staff in April 
2012 (a decrease of 1 per cent in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and an 
increase of 2 per cent in the Department of Field Support). The Advisory Committee 
recalls that the General Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to make 
further concrete efforts to ensure the proper representation of troop-contributing 
countries in the two Departments, taking into account their contribution to United 
Nations peacekeeping (see resolution 65/290, para. 7). The Advisory Committee 
reiterates its view that intensified efforts are required to improve 
representation of the countries concerned. The Committee requests that 
information on steps taken in this regard be included in the next report of the 
Secretary-General on the support account (see A/66/779, para. 28). 
 

  Management of vacant posts 
 

19. In its review of the support account budget for 2012/13, the Advisory 
Committee was informed that certain measures, which were aimed at monitoring 
post-related costs more closely, had been taken for all categories of vacant posts 
under the programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 (ibid., para. 29). It was 
indicated to the Committee then that the Secretariat would consider at a later stage, 
based on the experience gained from the regular budget, whether similar measures 
should apply to other funding sources, including the support account for 
peacekeeping operations. 



 A/67/848
 

9 13-32169 
 

20. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the measures 
pertained to the temporary use of vacant posts and did not have an impact on 
recruitment through the staff selection system. The Committee requested 
information on the implementation of the measures and was informed that the 
measures related to the management of vacant posts under the programme budget 
for the biennium 2012-2013 remained in effect. In addition, the same measures had 
been applied to posts funded under the support account for the period 2012/13. 
 
 

 III. Performance report for the period from 1 July 2011 to  
30 June 2012 
 
 

21. The Secretary-General provides information on the budget performance of the 
support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2011 to  
30 June 2012 in his report dated 12 December 2012 (A/67/635). A summary of key 
initiatives undertaken by the departments and offices concerned is provided in 
paragraphs 3 to 12 of the report. Information on planned and actual outputs relating 
to resource performance by all the departments and offices funded from the support 
account is contained in document A/67/635/Add.1. 

22. In his report on the budget performance of the support account for the period 
2011/12 (see A/67/635, para. 2), the Secretary-General indicates that a number of 
Security Council resolutions had had an impact on the activities of the departments 
and offices backstopping and supporting peacekeeping operations, including in 
particular: (a) the establishment of a new mission in South Sudan (UNMISS);  
(b) the deployment of a mission to the Abyei Area (UNISFA); (c) the closure of 
UNMIS in the Sudan; (d) the provision of support by UNOCI in Côte d’Ivoire to 
reconciliation issues and stabilization of the security situation following the post-
electoral crisis as well as the protection of civilians and the provision of support to 
legislative elections; (e) the rapid deployment of a new monitoring mission in the 
Syrian Arab Republic (UNSMIS) and the provision of support by the Mission to the 
work of the Joint Special Envoy; (f) prioritization of the protection of civilians and 
provision of support to the conduct of national, provincial and local elections by 
MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; (g) the continued building of 
national security capacities and assistance in the conduct of presidential and 
legislative elections by UNMIT in Timor-Leste; and (h) the implementation by 
UNIFIL of additional tasks in Lebanon mandated in resolution 1701 (2006). 

23. The total resources authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 
65/290 for the support account for the period 2011/12 amounted to $344,792,400 
(gross), comprising $191,452,300 for post resources, $106,154,900 for non-post 
resources and $47,185,200 for the enterprise resource planning project. 

24. Tables 1 and 2 of the performance report present, respectively, a summary of 
the resource performance for the period 2011/12 by category of expenditure and 
department/office. Expenditures for the period amounted to $344,786,400 against 
the approved resources of $344,792,400, reflecting almost full implementation of 
the approved budget. The unencumbered balance of $6,000, in gross terms, reflects 
the combined effect of higher-than-budgeted expenditures in respect of post 
resources ($9,817,300, or 5.1 per cent), mostly offset by underexpenditures under 
non-post resources ($9,823,300, or 9.3 per cent). 



A/67/848

25. Major variances in the resource performance for 2011/12 are explained in 
paragraphs 15 to 21 of the performance report (A/67/635). As indicated, the 
overexpenditure of $9.8 million in respect of post resources was attributable 
primarily to: (a) higher common staff costs resulting principally from the rotation of 
seconded military officers in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the 
increased number of staff members retiring and separating from the Organization in 
the Department of Field Support; and (b) lower vacancy rates than budgeted, 
principally in the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations, Field Support and 
Management. The overexpenditure under posts was offset by lower-than-budgeted 
expenditures in the following areas: 

 (a) General temporary assistance ($2,970,400), attributable primarily to: 

(i) higher-than-budgeted vacancy rates in the Investigations Division of 
OIOS owing to difficulties in the recruitment of investigators in Nairobi, 
Vienna and peacekeeping operations; and  

(ii) recruitment delays in the Departments of Management and Field Support; 

 (b) Consultants ($2,689,800), attributable primarily to the Department of 
Management, owing to: (i) the non-hiring of a consulting firm for the 
implementation of IPSAS in field missions and utilization instead of internal 
resources, supplemented by individual consultants; and (ii) fewer requirements for 
consultancy services to review bid protest cases of unsuccessful vendors, because 
fewer cases than anticipated were considered to be receivable; 

 (c) Official travel ($1,183,000), attributable to: (i) OIOS, owing to the 
postponement of the Investigations Division’s staff retreat, lower travel costs to 
conferences and reduced regional and within-mission travel owing to security 
concerns in Somalia, South Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic; and (ii) the 
Department of Safety and Security, owing to the cancellation of numerous planned 
visits following the crises in Côte d’Ivoire, Darfur and the Syrian Arab Republic and 
difficulties in obtaining visas for travel to UNAMID and UNMISS; 

 (d) Information technology ($1,497,900), attributable primarily to: (i) the 
failure to receive proposals from vendors to develop an electronic rations 
management system; (ii) the low usage of the Galaxy recruitment system, which 
resulted in a lower level of contractual services; (iii) the non-procurement by OIOS 
of the software for the case management system owing to deficiencies identified in 
the testing phase; and (iv) de-obligation of purchase orders in the Departments of 
Management and Peacekeeping Operations in order to absorb additional post 
requirements (see para. 28 below); 

 (e) Other supplies, services and equipment ($1,170,200), attributable 
primarily to: (i) lower expenditure than budgeted for after-service health insurance 
owing to a one-month premium holiday granted for one of the Headquarters-based 
medical plans and a lower increase than planned in costs for health plans based 
elsewhere in the world; (ii) lower bank charges than budgeted, owing to the full 
implementation of SWIFT for processing payments; and (iii) lower training fees in 
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as Member States offered to cover 
some costs associated with training.

 IV. Updated financial information in respect of the  
current period 
 
 

26. Information with respect to the financial performance for the period 2012/13 is 
set out in paragraphs 1 to 9 of the proposed budget for 2013/14 (A/67/756). 
Overexpenditures estimated at $15,050,200 are projected for the current period 
under post ($14,015,400) and non-post ($1,034,800) resources, owing to lower-than-
budgeted vacancy rates for posts and positions of all categories and higher-than-
budgeted common staff costs for both the 2011/12 and 2012/13 periods. A 
breakdown of the estimated overexpenditures by category is contained in a table in 
paragraph 8 of the Secretary-General’s proposed budget. 

27. With respect to variances in the budgeted and actual vacancy rates, the 
Secretary-General indicates that while the budgeted vacancy rates (15.9 per cent and 
7.9 per cent for the Professional and General Service categories, respectively) were 
based on the average actual incumbency rates in February 2012, the actual vacancy 
rates have steadily decreased (10 per cent and 6.1 per cent for the Professional and 
General Service categories, respectively, as at 31 January 2013), as a result of 
intensified efforts to fill vacant posts and general temporary assistance positions 
since the latter part of the 2011/12 financial period. The budgeted, actual and 
projected vacancy rates for posts and positions are shown in the table in paragraph 4 
of the Secretary-General’s budget report. 

28. The Secretary-General further indicates that in order to partly offset the 
overexpenditure of $9.8 million recorded under post resources for the 2011/12 
period, valid obligations in the amount of $1.7 million had to be de-obligated under 
non-post resources at the closure of the financial period, which have been now 
recorded in the financial period for 2012/13. The Advisory Committee requested 
more detailed information on the obligations that were de-obligated for 2011/12 and 
re-obligated for 2012/13 and was informed, inter alia, of the following: 

 (a) Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support: a total of 
$881,000 ($770,324 for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and $110,676 for 
the Department of Field Support), of which an amount of $444,000, some 50 per cent, 
was related to communications and information technology for which various 
obligations for equipment and services were cancelled in 2011/12 and re-obligated in the 
current fiscal period. Since most of the requisitions for the communications and 
information technology requirements had already been processed in line with the current 
budget appropriations, the amount required to be re-obligated, $444,000, would then 
need to be met from the funding earmarked for information technology services during 
the current period, 2012/13. As a result, funds approved for 2012/13 earmarked for the 
replacement of equipment and other activities would not be delivered; 

 (b) Department of Management: a total of $869,100, of which $583,000, or 
67 per cent, related to various obligations for contractual services under information 
technology ($569,000) and consultants ($14,000) had to be re-obligated in the 
current 2012/13 financial period since the services had already been received by the 
Organization during 2011/12. 

29. The Advisory Committee enquired as to how the implementation of IPSAS 
would affect such practice and was informed that currently under the United Nations 
System Accounting Standards (financial rule 105.9), obligations are recorded as 
expenditures based on a formal contract, agreement, purchase order or other form of 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 12 
 

undertaking regardless of whether the goods or services had been received or 
rendered. When IPSAS is implemented, obligations will not be recognized as 
expenditures during the financial period if goods or services have not been received 
or rendered before the end of the period. In line with the IPSAS delivery principle, 
when obligations have been raised for which goods have been received and services 
have been rendered, such obligations cannot be cancelled. 

30. The Secretary-General is requesting the General Assembly to approve 
additional requirements in the amount of $15,050,200 for 2012/13 (see A/67/756, 
para. 727). The Advisory Committee notes that the actual expenditures for the 
current period amounted to $51,188,900 as at 31 January 2013 (see A/67/756, 
para. 8, table). The Advisory Committee is of the view that the Secretary-
General should make every effort to absorb the overexpenditures for the 
current financial period. The Committee also requests that the most up-to-date 
information on current and projected expenditures, as well as on incumbency 
rates, be provided to the General Assembly at the time of its consideration of 
the Secretary-General’s proposals for the support account budget for 2013/14. 
 
 

 V. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2013 to  
30 June 2014 
 
 

 A. Overall resource requirements 
 
 

31. In his report on the budget for the support account for the period from 1 July 
2013 to 30 June 2014 (A/67/756), the Secretary-General proposes total resource 
requirements estimated at $327,244,600 (gross),3 an increase of $9,251,600, or  
2.9 per cent, compared with the appropriation for 2012/13 (see para. 81 below). The 
total resource requirements proposed for 2013/14 include the following: 

 (a) Post and non-post resources in the amount of $308,575,800 (an increase 
of $27,920,400, or 9.9 per cent, compared with the post and non-post resources 
approved for 2012/13), consisting of post resources ($219,661,300) and non-post 
resources ($88,914,500); 

 (b) Enterprise resource planning project requirements in the amount of 
$18,668,800, representing a decrease of 50 per cent of the provision for 2012/13. 

32. The Advisory Committee notes from the proposed budget that the resource 
requirements proposed for 2013/14 also include, for the first time: (a) resources in 
the amount of $690,800 for OHCHR, including three posts; and (b) an amount of 
$571,400 for the United Nations Operations and Crisis Centre, which was activated 
in January 2013 and has been funded through existing resources by participating 
offices, departments and UNDP (ibid., paras. 12, 27 and 34). 

33. The Secretary-General provides an analysis of the proposed resource 
requirements for 2013/14 in paragraphs 25 to 48 of his budget proposal (A/67/756), 
with a table in paragraph 36 showing a breakdown of the main factors contributing to 
the increases in the requirements for 2013/14.4 He indicates that the increase of

 4 The table in paragraph 36 of the budget proposal was updated in the addendum to the report (see 

A/67/756/Add.1, annex). 



 A/67/848
 

13 13-32169 
 

$27,920,400, or 9.9 per cent, under post and non-post resources proposed for 2013/14 
(excluding the enterprise resource planning project) is attributable primarily to, inter 
alia, the following: (a) reduced vacancy rates ($20.5 million); (b) higher common staff 
costs ($2 million); (c) updated standard salary costs ($3.5 million); (d) triennial 
contingent-owned equipment working group ($1.8 million); and (e) renewed lease rate 
for rental of premises ($1.7 million) (see paras. 38-41 below). 
 

  Budget parameters 
 

34. The budget parameters applied for post and non-post resources for 2013/14 are 
explained in paragraphs 51 to 58 of the Secretary-General’s budget document 
(A/67/756). They include two tables illustrating approved and proposed vacancy 
rates (para. 51), as well as revised standard rates for rental of premises, office 
supplies, commercial communications services and equipment, information 
technology equipment and service agreements for maintenance, repair and 
infrastructure support (para. 53). 
 

  Vacancy rates 
 

35. The Advisory Committee notes that vacancy rates of 8 per cent and 5 per cent, 
respectively, have been applied to the estimates for posts in the Professional and 
above and General Service and related categories for 2013/14, based on the 
projected vacancy rates as at June 2013 as shown in the table in paragraph 4 of the 
proposed budget. The Committee also notes from the table that the actual average 
vacancy rates stood at 10.3 per cent and 5.2 per cent, respectively, for posts in the 
Professional and above and General Service and related categories for the period 
from July 2012 to January 2013. The Advisory Committee is of the view that the 
vacancy factors to be applied for the support account budget should reflect the 
actual average vacancy rates rather than the projected rates; it therefore 
recommends that a vacancy factor of 10 per cent be applied to the cost 
estimates for posts in the Professional and above category for 2013/14. The 
Committee also recommends that the Secretary-General provide the most  
up-to-date vacancy rates for posts of all categories to the General Assembly at 
the time of its consideration of the support account budget to enable it to make 
an informed decision. 
 

  Revised standard rates  
 

36. In its consideration of the proposed budget for the support account for 2012/13, 
the Advisory Committee noted the high average costs for computers and requested 
that a review of the actual unit cost be undertaken and the results of the review, 
including possible revised rates, be provided in the context of the next budget 
submission (see A/66/779, para. 44). In this connection, the Committee notes that in 
addition to standard rates for computers, the Secretariat has reviewed and revised 
other standard costs applicable (see A/67/756, para. 53 and table). Of the nine 
standard costs presented in the table, three will remain the same (office supplies, 
desktop repair and maintenance, and desktop and mobile phone equipment), four have 
been revised downwards (desktop and laptop computers, copiers and printers, and 
desktop phone equipment and installation), while two have been revised upwards 
(desktop and mobile phone services, and commercial office rental rate). 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 14 
 

37. The Advisory Committee notes that the rate for desktop and mobile phone 
services will increase from $1,400 to $1,800 per staff, which is one of the factors 
contributing to the overall proposed budget increase for 2013/14 by the amount of 
$824,000 (ibid., para. 33). On the use of mobile devices and mitigating measures to 
address the cost increase, the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the 
measures undertaken by the relevant departments and offices included approval by 
certifying officers in the Executive Office to ensure compliance; monitoring related 
expenditures to ensure efficient use of resources and to prevent overexpenditure; and 
reviews from time to time to ascertain whether staff members’ functions continue to 
justify the provision of the devices by the Organization. The Committee also 
requested a list of posts and functions that required mobile devices under the support 
account. Information on the number of staff in possession of mobile devices versus the 
total number of staffing level approved for 2012/13 under the support account is as 
follows: Department of Peacekeeping Operations (104/497), Department of Field 
Support (94/398), Department of Management (82/250), OIOS (27/99), Executive 
Office of the Secretary-General (3/5), Office of Legal Affairs (5/15), Department of 
Public Information (2/4) and Department of Safety and Security (16/18). The 
Advisory Committee considers that the measures described by the Secretariat are 
unsatisfactory and requests that more stringent measures be put in place with a 
view to effectively curtailing the cost increase. 

38. The Secretary-General indicates that based on the current market rate for 
commercial space, the annual rental rate of $15,900 per staff (compared with 
$14,300 for 2012/13) has been applied to all proposed posts at Headquarters, which 
is centrally managed by the Department of Management on behalf of all 
departments and offices funded under the support account (ibid., para. 54). The 
Advisory Committee enquired on the number of staff who were accommodated at 
the Headquarters compound and in leased office space in New York and was 
provided with the following table showing the locations of staff on support account 
posts and positions, as at 4 April 2013. The Committee notes from the table that of 
the total of 1,234 staff, 562 (45 per cent) are accommodated at the Headquarters 
compound and 672 (55 per cent) are in commercially leased offices.

39. The Advisory Committee also requested information on the total number of 
staff and the total amount budgeted for commercial rental cost in the proposed 
budget for the support account for 2013/14. The Committee was informed that rental 
costs for 1,310 staff members (posts and general temporary assistance positions at 
Headquarters) and contractors were budgeted at the rate of $15,900 per staff for a 
total amount of $20,829,000 for 2013/14. It was indicated to the Committee that the 



 A/67/848
 

15 13-32169 
 

standard cost was applicable to all personnel (staff, contractors, consultants, etc.) as 
per the estimation guide for standard common service costs issued by the Director 
of the Programme Planning and Budget Division, irrespective of location, and that 
office space in owned and leased buildings was managed centrally and that costs 
were not allocated to Departments based on the buildings in which they are located.  

40. In its consideration of the tenth annual progress report on the implementation 
of the capital master plan, the Advisory Committee stressed that the maximum 
possible number of staff should be accommodated at the renovated Headquarters 
campus, and off-campus rental should be kept at a minimum level and under 
constant review (A/67/548, para. 42).  

41. In the view of the Advisory Committee, the practice of applying rental 
costs to all staff irrespective of their office location lacks transparency in 
budgeting, when close to half of the staff are accommodated at the 
Headquarters campus but still charged with commercial rental costs under the 
support account. The Committee will review the issue in its consideration of the 
programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015.  

 

  Post resources 
 

42. The proposed post requirements for the support account for 2013/14 amount to 
$219,661,300, an increase of $27,547,000, or 14.3 per cent, as compared with the 
requirements for 2012/13. The amount provides for 1,325 posts (900 Professional 
and 425 General Service), compared with 1,294 posts approved for 2012/13 
(871 Professional and 423 General Service), representing an increase of 31 posts 
(see A/67/756, summary, and sect. II). A summary of the staffing changes proposed 
by the Secretary-General and the related recommendations of the Advisory 
Committee are provided below.5 
 

  New posts 
 

43. The Secretary-General is proposing to establish a total of 62 new posts for the 
period 2013/14, of which 57 are conversions from general temporary assistance 
positions. A brief summary of the new posts proposed is set out below: 

 (a) Department of Peacekeeping Operations: two posts (1 D-2 and 1 General 
Service (Other level)) to be established in the Office of Evaluation of Field 
Uniformed Personnel, Office of the Under-Secretary-General; 

 (b) OIOS: 51 general temporary assistance positions to be converted to posts 
in the Investigations Division, following the completion of the pilot project (see 
para. 123 below); 

 (c) Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services: two 
general temporary assistance positions to be converted to posts (1 P-4 and 1 General 
Service (Other level)) (see para. 124 below); 

 (d) Office of Legal Affairs: three general temporary assistance positions to 
be converted to posts (2 P-4 and 1 P-3) in the General Legal Division (see  
paras. 128-129 below); 

__________________ 

 5  The staffing requirements reflect the Secretary-General’s proposals in document A/67/756, 
which were adjusted to reflect the budget process review (see A/67/756/Add.1) (see sect. V.B 
below and annexes II to IV). 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 16 
 

 (e) Secretariat of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
Questions: one P-4 general temporary assistance position to be converted to a post; 

 (f) OHCHR: three posts (1 D-1, 1 P-4 and 1 P-3) to be established in the 
Office (see paras. 130-132 below).  

44. With respect to the 62 new posts proposed by the Secretary-General, the 
Advisory Committee has no objection to the proposed establishment of 57 new 
posts. However, the Committee does not recommend approval of: (a) the 
conversion of two positions (1 P-4 and 1 General Service (Other level)) in the 
Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services and two 
positions (1 P-4 and 1 P-3 Legal Officers for Administration of Justice Matters) 
in the Office of Legal Affairs; those four positions should be continued under 
general temporary assistance for 2013/14; or (b) the establishment of one post 
at the D-1 level for OHCHR. 

 

  Abolishment 
 

45. A total of 31 posts are proposed for abolishment in the support account 
(A/67/756, section II), including in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
(14 posts and 1 United Nations Volunteer), the Department of Field Support (10 
posts), the Department of Management (3 posts) and OIOS (3 posts). Of the 10 posts 
proposed for abolishment in the Department of Field Support, three posts in the 
Field Budget and Finance Division (1 P-4, 1 P-2 and 1 General Service (Other level) 
are related to the peacekeeping budget process review, and comments and 
recommendations by the Advisory Committee are contained in paragraphs 74 and 79 
below. The Advisory Committee, therefore, has no objection to the abolishment 
of the remaining 28 posts proposed by the Secretary-General. 
 

  Redeployment  
 

46. A total of 36 posts are proposed for redeployment for 2013/14, as follows:  

 (a) Department of Peacekeeping Operations (2 posts): 1 P-3 and 1 P-4 
Political Affairs Officers from the Asia Integrated Operational Team to the Middle 
East and West Africa Integrated Operational Teams, respectively, owing to the 
closure of UNMIT; 

 (b) Department of Field Support (8 posts): five posts (2 P-4, 1 P-3 and  
2 General Service (Other level)) to the proposed new strategic support team and 
three posts (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 1 General Service (Other level)) to the new operational 
support team (see paras. 97-98 below);  

 (c) OIOS (26 posts) (see para. 123 below).  

The Advisory Committee has no objection to the redeployments proposed by 
the Secretary-General. 

 

  Reassignment/reclassification 
 

47. It is proposed to reassign the following three posts to the new Office of the 
Director, Evaluation of Field Uniformed Personnel, within the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations: one Senior Military Liaison Officer post at the P-5 level 
from the Office of the Military Adviser, 1 Senior Police Liaison Officer post at the 
P-5 level from the Police Division, and 1 Logistics Support Officer post at the P-4 



 A/67/848
 

17 13-32169 
 

level from the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General. Based on the 
justifications provided by the Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee has 
no objection to the proposed reassignment of the three posts within the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  

48. Reclassification of the following 15 posts is proposed:  

 (a) Department of Peacekeeping Operations: four seconded officer posts to 
civilian posts in the Office of the Military Adviser; 

 (b) Department of Field Support: (i) one seconded officer post to a civilian 
post; (ii) one post at the P-5 level (Chief of Logistics Operations) to the D-1 level 
(Team Leader) (also to be reassigned from the Logistics Support Division to the 
operational support team); 

 (c) OIOS: (i) five P-4 level posts of Investigator to Chief Resident 
Investigators at the P-5 level in MONUSCO, MINUSTAH, UNMIL, UNMISS and 
UNOCI; and (ii) four General Service (Other level) posts to national General Service 
posts in MINUSTAH, UNMISS, UNOCI and the Resident Audit Office at Entebbe, 
Uganda; the justifications for the proposed reclassification to Chief Resident 
Investigators at the P-5 level are provided in paragraph 544 of document A/67/756. 

49. The Advisory Committee does not recommend approval of the proposed 
reclassification of seconded officer posts to civilian posts in the Departments of 
Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support (see para. 94-96 below). The 
Committee has no objection to: (a) the proposed reassignment of the P-5 post 
within the Department of Field Support and the reclassification of the post to 
the D-1 level; and (b) the proposed reclassification of the five posts from 
Investigators at the P-4 level to Chief Resident Investigators at the P-5 level 
and the four General Service (Other level) posts to national General Service 
posts in OIOS.  
 

  Restructuring 
 

50. The Secretary-General is proposing organizational changes as follows (see 
annex IV): 

 (a) Department of Peacekeeping Operations: establishment of the Office of 
the Director, Evaluation of Field Uniformed Personnel, Office of the Under-
Secretary-General; 

 (b) Department of Field Support: 

 (i) Establishment of the Strategic Support Team in the Office of the Under-
Secretary-General; 

 (ii) Establishment of the Operational Support Team in the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary-General; 

 (iii) Reorganization of the Field Personnel Division into a three-pillar 
structure: the Operation Planning and Monitoring Service, the Field Human 
Resources Strategy Service and the Recruitment, Outreach and Career 
Development Section; 

 (iv) Redeployment of the Cartographic Section of the Strategic Support 
Service from the Logistics Support Division to the Field Communications and 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 18 
 

Information Technology Operations Service of the Information and 
Communications Technology Division; 

 (c) Department of Management: reorganization of the Procurement Division 
as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on procurement activities (see 
A/67/683, sect. II.A, and paras. 114-115 below); 

 (d) OIOS: reorganization of the Investigations Division to include the 
Headquarters Office, the regional investigation offices in Vienna and Entebbe, and 
investigation offices in five peacekeeping missions (MONUSCO, MINUSTAH, 
UNMIL, UNMISS and UNOCI). 

51. With regard to the proposed restructuring, the Advisory Committee is of the 
view that any organizational changes and the designation of organizational structures 
(divisions/services/sections/units) should be aligned with the standard structure and 
nomenclature set out in ST/SGB/Organization of 8 August 1996. The Advisory 
Committee has no objection to the proposed organizational changes as proposed 
by the Secretary-General, except for the proposed reorganization of the Field 
Personnel Division of the Department of Field Support (see paras. 99-101 below). 
The Committee has expressed its view on the Regional Procurement Office at Entebbe 
in its report on procurement activities (see A/67/801, paras. 10-15). 

52. The Advisory Committee notes that the secondary active telecommunications 
facility at Valencia is referred to as the United Nations Support Base at Valencia in the 
proposed budget for the support account for 2013/14 (A/67/756). In its report on UNLB, 
the Committee recommended that the Secretary-General be requested to ensure 
application of a consistent designation of the facility throughout the documents 
submitted for consideration by the General Assembly, reflecting its use for information 
and communications technology purposes (see A/67/780/Add.10, para. 31). 
 

  Review of vacant posts 
 

53. The Advisory Committee recalls that, as requested by the General Assembly, 
posts that will have been vacant for at least 12 months by 30 June of a given year 
should be submitted during consideration of the support account budget (resolution 
58/298, para. 12). The Committee notes from the proposed budget that the 
Secretary-General does not anticipate that any continuing posts will have been 
vacant for 12 months or more as at 31 June 2013 (see A/67/756, para. 59). The 
Committee requested information on the current vacant posts in all departments and 
offices, including the number and length of the vacant posts and recruitment status, 
which is attached as annex VI to the present report. 
 

  Non-post resources 
 

  General temporary assistance  
 

54. The Advisory Committee notes that 75 positions funded under general 
temporary assistance are proposed for 2013/14, compared with 135 approved 
positions. The net reduction of 60 positions for 2013/14 reflects the proposed 
conversion of 57 positions to posts, discontinuation of four positions (1 in the Office 
of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts/Department of Management, see  
paras. 74, 79 and 82 below) and one new position. The new position (Legal Officer at 
the P-3 level) is proposed for the Management Evaluation Unit in the Office of the 
Under-Secretary-General for Management, and justifications are provided in 



 A/67/848
 

19 13-32169 
 

paragraphs 323 to 328 of the proposed budget for 2013/14. For positions of less than 
12-month duration, 68 person-months are proposed for 2013/14. The Advisory 
Committee recommends approval of the proposed continuation of the 74 
positions, the funding of one new position and the continuation of the 68 person-
months based on the justifications provided by the Secretary-General. 

55. In its consideration of the proposed budget for the support account for 2012/13, 
the Advisory Committee noted that a significant number of the general temporary 
positions had been in existence for three years or more, including dozens for four to 
five years and over. The Committee further notes from annex V to the present report 
that its earlier observation remains valid. The Advisory Committee, therefore, 
reiterates its view that the fact that so many positions have continued in the form 
of general temporary assistance for so many years is indicative of a need for a 
review of the functions concerned to determine whether they are indeed of a 
temporary or rather of a continuing nature. While the Advisory Committee 
understands that some of those positions may have arisen from the decisions of 
the General Assembly itself, it is of the view that the utilization of general 
temporary assistance positions should preserve budgetary transparency. In this 
connection, it recalls that general temporary assistance is intended for functions 
of a temporary nature (see A/66/779, para. 60). 
 

  Consultants 
 

56. The proposed resources for consultants for 2013/14 amount to $5,779,300, an 
increase of $79,700, or 1.4 per cent, compared with the provision for the current 
period, representing 1.9 per cent of the total resource requirements of the proposed 
budget for 2013/14 (see A/67/756, summary, and para. 50, table). The Secretary-
General provides an analysis of the consultancy requirements in paragraphs 49 and 
50 of his budget proposal, with two tables showing: (a) a breakdown of the resource 
allocation by department/office and status (continuing or new); and (b) the 
increase/decrease of total consultancy requirements, and as a percentage of the 
support account, since financial period 2008/09 (excluding provisions for the 
enterprise resource planning project). As shown in the table, the consultancy 
requirement and its percentage of the support account for 2008/09 were the highest 
($6.8 million, or 2.4 per cent), while the requirement and the percentage for 2010/11 
were the lowest ($3.5 million, or 1.1 per cent).  

57. The Advisory Committee notes that a provision of $98,000 is requested for the 
Ethics Office for a consultant for eight person-months to conduct an annual survey 
to evaluate the organizational culture for ethics and integrity in peacekeeping 
missions, using the survey completed in 2012/13 as the baseline data (ibid.,  
para. 620). The Committee questions the necessity for such surveys on an annual 
basis and was informed, upon enquiry, that the Department of Field Support had 
requested the Office to extend the initial survey in 2012 to additional missions. 
Pending further consultation with the Department, the Ethics Office could conduct a 
survey either to include additional missions or to follow on the research on the five 
missions in the original survey. The Advisory Committee questions the need for 
an annual survey to evaluate the organizational culture for ethics and integrity 
in peacekeeping missions.  

58. It is the view of the Advisory Committee that the proposed consultancy 
requirements for 2013/14, both in terms of the total amount and the percentage, are 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 20 
 

still high. The Committee is, therefore, of the view that the Secretary-General 
should further review and reduce the need for consultants and use his in-house 
capacity to the fullest. The Committee is recommending a reduction of $50,000 
under consultants for the Department of Management, as there has been 
consistent underexpenditure under this budget line over the past five financial 
periods (see para. 102 below). 
 

  Official travel 
 

59. The proposed requirements for official travel for 2013/14 amount to 
$10,994,600, an increase of $1,247,900, or 12.8 per cent, compared with the 
provisions for 2012/13 (see A/67/756, summary).6 The requirements for travel 
proposed for the 10 departments and offices to be funded under the support account, 
as presented in the report of the Secretary-General (A/67/756), are as follows:

60. As the table above shows, travel requirements requested for 7 of  
10 departments and offices have increased to various degrees, the highest being 
67.3 per cent for the Department of Field Support. In its review of the proposed 
requirement for official travel for 2013/14, the Committee has identified cases, such 
as the following, in which it believes that the Secretary-General should prioritize the 
travel resources:  

__________________ 

 6  In document A/67/756/Add.1, the requirement for official travel has been revised to 
$11,194,600, an increase of $1,447,900, or 14.9 per cent, compared with the provisions for the 
current period (see annex I to the present report). 



 A/67/848
 

21 13-32169 
 

 (a) Department of Peacekeeping Operations:  

 (i) UNOAU: a provision is made for the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General and three staff to attend a budget hearing of the Advisory 
Committee on the support account for five days, the Committee has had 
hearings with UNOAU on its proposed budget under the support account for 
the past two years via videoconferencing, which has been satisfactory (see 
paras. 86-87 below); 

 (ii) Office of the Under-Secretary-General: staff exchange programme, by 
which four staff from Headquarters would serve in field missions and four 
staff from missions would serve at Headquarters for a period of three months 
($131,600); the Committee is of the view that the requirement could be 
reduced by 50 per cent (ibid., para. 100); 

 (iii) Policy, Evaluation and Training Division: the proposed travel 
requirement would increase by $203,300, or 13 per cent, attributable to the 
planned participation of senior staff from Headquarters to the Senior Mission 
Administration and Resource Training Programme and travel of staff to 
organize and support the programme (ibid., paras. 179 and 184); upon enquiry, 
the Advisory Committee was informed that the same number of face-to-face 
workshops (3) and e-learning modules (6) would be conducted for 2013/14, 
compared with the current period. The Committee is of the view that the level 
of travel resources could be kept at the same level as for 2012/13; 

 (b) Department of Field Support/Office of the Under-Secretary-General: the 
proposed increased requirement of $94,900, or 51.2 per cent, is owing mainly to 
higher requirements for travel to the Regional Service Centre to ensure the 
implementation of the global field support strategy (ibid., para. 219). Upon enquiry, 
the Committee was informed that the proposed increased requirement included 
$38,400 for more visits to field missions. The Committee encourages the Office to 
lead by example by utilizing videoconferencing and recommends that the travel 
requirement be kept at the same level as for 2012/13; 

 (c) Department of Management/Office of Programme Planning, Budget and 
Accounts: visits to four peacekeeping missions to advise finance staff on treasury 
policies and procedures, cash management and banking related issues ($35,000), 
and to participate at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund to ensure that the Treasury is up to date on global financial issues 
($5,000) (ibid., paras. 375, 377 and 378). The Committee is not convinced of the 
need for the trips concerned and is of the view that the proposed travel requirements 
could be reduced; 

 (d) OIOS: a provision of $260,000 is proposed for biannual training of 
resident auditors and assistants (ibid., para. 562). The Committee is not convinced 
of the need for biannual training and is of the view that annual, instead of biannual, 
training could reduce the requirement by 50 per cent; 

 (e) Office of the Ombudsman and Mediation Services: the higher 
requirements (an increase of $27,400, or 21.2 per cent) are attributable to travel 
related to training activities as a result of advancement in the ombudsman industry 
and the need for the Organization’s ombudsmen to be at the cutting edge of new 
skills (ibid., para. 604). The Committee points out that as the cases are projected to 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 22 
 

decrease for 2013/14 (ibid., para. 593), the resources for travel could be reduced 
accordingly; 

 (f) OHCHR: an amount of $232,200 is proposed (the first year that the Office 
is included in the support account); the Committee was informed upon enquiry that 
during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 March 2013, the Office spent approximately 
$537,817 for travel in connection with providing support to peacekeeping operations. 
The Committee is of the view that the planned travel requirements associated with the 
proposed new D-1 post in the Office could be adjusted, as the Committee does not 
recommend approval of the post (see para. 44 (b) above). 

61. Moreover, on issues related to standards of accommodation for air travel, the 
Advisory Committee notes that a series of measures that have been adopted by the 
General Assembly in its recent resolution, such as more strict limits on travel by 
business class and efforts to reduce short-notice travel by initiating the 16-day 
advanced booking of tickets, would have an impact on costs related to air travel of 
the Organization, including peacekeeping missions (resolution 67/254, sect. VI). 
While the Advisory Committee is aware that the financial impact on the travel 
budget of the Organization following the implementation of the measures 
introduced in the recent resolution by the General Assembly and potential cost 
reductions in air travel are yet to be demonstrated, it expects that those 
measures will contain costs under air travel. The Committee requests that all 
savings achieved in this regard be reported in the performance report of the 
support account. 

62. While the Committee accepts that the effective delivery of mandates 
necessitates travel, it remains concerned about the disruption to the day-to-day 
work of staff and the possible impact on programme delivery of prolonged 
absences from duty stations (see A/66/718, para. 138). The Committee also 
reiterates its view that resources for travel should be kept to a minimum in 
view of improvements in other means of communication (A/66/779, para. 65). 
The Committee has also expressed the view in its earlier report on air travel 
(see A/66/739, para. 26) that the primary consideration in authorizing official 
travel should be whether direct face-to-face contact is necessary for mandate 
implementation. If not, then alternative methods should be employed. It is the 
view of the Committee that the Secretary-General should strive to better 
manage official travel and further prioritize requirements in this regard. The 
Committee therefore recommends a total reduction of 10 per cent ($1,119,460) 
to the proposed requirements of $11,194,600 under official travel for the 
support account for 2013/14.7  

63. In its report on cross-cutting issues related to the United Nations peacekeeping 
operations (A/67/780, para. 144), the Advisory Committee recommends that the 
General Assembly request the Secretary-General to entrust OIOS with the task of 
keeping official travel in peacekeeping missions under review for the 2013/14 
period. In this connection, the Committee recommends that the scope of this 
review also include official travel under the support account for peacekeeping 
operations so that the review to be conducted will be comprehensive.

  Communications 
 

64. The Advisory Committee recommends a reduction of $18,000 proposed for 
the purchase of videoconferencing equipment under communications for the 
Ethics Office (see para. 127 below). 
 
 

 B. Budget process review and adjusted resource requirements  
for 2013/14 
 
 

  Budget process review 
 

65. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in his previous overview report, the 
Secretary-General had indicated that the Departments of Management, Peacekeeping 
Operations and Field Support had commenced a joint review of the peacekeeping 
budget development process with a view to better supporting Member States in their 
decision-making on mission budgets. The goals of the review were to: streamline 
the current process; maximize time available for strategic analysis and decision-
making; and clarify further the roles and the responsibilities of the different 
stakeholders and departments at Headquarters and in the field (see A/66/679,  
para. 55). In its resolution 66/264, the General Assembly endorsed the observations 
of the Advisory Committee set out in paragraph 7 of its related report (A/66/718) 
that the Committee was unconvinced that the current organizational structure was 
best suited to ensure clarity of responsibility and accountability for the presentation 
of budgets for peacekeeping operations and that it considered that the current budget 
development process was not optimal. The Assembly also endorsed the Committee’s 
request that the results of the review be provided. 

66. The addendum to the support account budget document (A/67/756/Add.1) 
includes information on the results of the review, which was conducted by a senior-
level working group led by the Under-Secretaries-General for Field Support and 
Management, as well as a series of proposals designed to address the issues 
identified. As indicated in paragraph 3 of the document, those issues include the 
less-than-optimal allocation of resources among the actors involved in the process; 
the higher-than-desired amounts of time/resources spent correcting/revising 
submissions as opposed to analysing them; the lack of clarity regarding the roles 
and responsibilities, as well as the specific value added, of multiple stakeholders; 
the fact that the current division of responsibilities often compromises efforts to 
implement measures to address known concerns; and the fact that stakeholders in 
the missions and the intergovernmental bodies do not feel that the current process 
meets their needs. 

67. The Secretary-General explains, in paragraph 6 of the addendum, that the 
proposed new process would see the Peacekeeping Financing Division of the Office 
of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts assuming an expanded role for the 
end-to-end budget development process, including preparing annual budget and 
performance reports from proposals submitted directly to the Controller by heads of 
mission (see also para. 69 below). In order to perform its expanded role, the 
Division would be strengthened with the addition of 12 posts (see paras. 74-76 
below for a more detailed description of the Secretary-General’s staffing proposals). 

68. The Secretary-General also states that, under the proposed new process, heads 
of mission would remain responsible for the preparation of their missions’ budgets, 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 24 
 

in accordance with General Assembly resolution 59/296 and all subsequent cross-
cutting and mission-specific resolutions. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 
61/279 and subsequent relevant resolutions, the Departments of Peacekeeping 
Operations and Field Support would continue to lead and provide field missions 
with strategic guidance on operational and support requirements for the delivery of 
their mandates. The Field Budget and Finance Division would fulfil its responsibilities 
by continuing to focus on identifying major resourcing priorities, efficiencies and 
standard resourcing allocations across field missions, including through the work of 
the Resource Efficiency Group. In that connection, the Advisory Committee 
points out that, as indicated in paragraph 20 of the addendum, an enhanced 
role for the Field Budget and Finance Division in the strategic oversight and 
management of resources is fully consistent with the evolving role of the 
Department of Field Support at Headquarters in the context of the global field 
support strategy. A detailed description of the proposed new roles and 
responsibilities of the Peacekeeping Financing Division and the Field Budget and 
Finance Division are set out in paragraphs 7 to 10 of the addendum. 

69. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with two charts, the first 
depicting the current budget development process and the second depicting the 
proposed new process. The charts illustrate that the new process will continue to 
consist of three distinct stages: planning and guidance; preparation; and approval. It 
is the Committee’s understanding that the most significant change to the process is 
the removal, at the preparation stage, of the requirement for finalization and 
approval by the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support of the 
budget packages submitted by missions prior to their transmittal to the Office of 
Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. Instead, following initial consultations 
with those Departments, missions will submit their budget proposals directly to the 
Peacekeeping Financing Division. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was 
informed that consolidating the budget review process in the Peacekeeping 
Financing Division would improve its efficiency by allowing for direct contact 
between those responsible for preparing the budget submissions (the missions) and 
those responsible for reviewing those submissions and preparing the final budget 
reports (the Peacekeeping Financing Division), thereby eliminating any duplication 
of roles and practices. 

70. In response to an enquiry as to the measures envisaged to ensure that the 
reduced participation of the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field 
Support at the budget preparation stage did not have an adverse impact on the 
quality of the final proposals, the Advisory Committee was informed that the 
revised budget process preserved the mandated responsibilities and accountabilities 
of all those engaged in the development of peacekeeping budgets, while at the same 
time further clarifying the roles and focus of each. The Committee was informed 
that the responsibilities and authorities of the Under-Secretaries-General for 
Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support would continue to manifest themselves 
at two distinct stages of the budget process. First, during the planning and guidance 
stage, the Under-Secretaries-General, supported by their respective Departments, 
would continue to provide strategic guidance regarding the resources needed for 
mandate implementation and approve the mission priorities, major planning 
assumptions and results-based-budgeting frameworks. Second, at the approval stage, 
the Under-Secretaries-General would remain responsible for considering the 
proposed budget report for each mission to ensure that it adequately reflected the 



 A/67/848
 

25 13-32169 
 

mandate, circumstances and expected work of the mission, properly aligned 
resource proposals with the approved strategic direction, and contained the level of 
resources required for mandate implementation. Only once the Under-Secretaries-
General had endorsed the proposed budget reports would they be submitted to the 
Controller for final approval. 

71. Upon enquiry as to the specific operational benefits of the proposed new 
process, the Advisory Committee was informed that, at the planning and guidance 
stage, a stronger emphasis on strategic guidance and decision-making within the 
Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support would bring greater 
clarity to missions, providing a framework in which they could focus on preparing 
their budgets on the basis of requirements that had been agreed from the outset. In 
addition, allowing the Peacekeeping Financing Division to participate in the initial 
discussions with the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support 
would provide the former with a better understanding of the rationale for resource 
requests. Further, the issuance of single joint budget instructions by the Office of 
Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts and the Departments of Peacekeeping 
Operations and Field Support would ensure that all relevant guidance relating to the 
preparation of the budget submissions was streamlined and transmitted to missions 
in one integrated package at the very beginning of the process, rather than being 
sent piecemeal at different times. 

72. The Advisory Committee was also informed that, at the budget preparation 
stage, a number of improvements to the budget costing sheets and their possible 
automation would reduce the time taken for missions to complete their submissions 
and limit the potential for errors. The efficiency of that stage would be further 
enhanced by consolidating the budget review process in the Peacekeeping Financing 
Division, and, taken together, all those improvements would serve to ensure that the 
final reports presented to the legislative bodies were of better quality and submitted 
in a more timely manner (see also para. 73 below). 

73. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the success of the 
proposed improvements to the budget process would be measured against the 
following benchmarks: 

 • Quality: positive feedback from the legislative bodies on the format and 
presentation of peacekeeping budgets, performance reports and other related 
reports. It was anticipated, in particular, that greater attention would be paid to 
improving the way in which data was presented in the reports and to providing 
better analysis of that data in the narrative. 

 • Timeliness: 100 per cent of all draft budget reports finalized by mid-December 
(as opposed to the end of January or mid-February, as is currently the case). This 
would give the legislative bodies more time to consider the proposed budgets. 

The Committee was also informed, during its consideration of the Secretary-
General’s proposals, that the full benefits of the new process would not be realized 
immediately, but would rather manifest themselves incrementally over the next two 
to three years. 

74. In order to operationalize the proposed changes to the current budget process, 
the Secretary-General indicates in the addendum to the support account document 
that 12 additional posts would be needed to strengthen the Office of Programme 
Planning, Budget and Accounts, which is not adequately staffed to cope with the 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 26 
 

additional workload that would arise from its expanded role. Accordingly, two of the 
three posts (1 P-4 and 1 General Service (Other level)) originally proposed to be 
abolished in the Field Budget and Finance Division (see A/67/756, para. 224) would 
be retained and redeployed/reassigned to the Peacekeeping Financing Division. Nine 
further posts (3 P-4, 3 P-3 and 3 General Service (Other level)) in the Field Budget 
and Finance Division would be reassigned/redeployed to the Peacekeeping 
Financing Division, and one of the two P-3 positions currently funded under general 
temporary assistance in the Peacekeeping Financing Division would be converted to 
a post rather than be discontinued, as originally proposed (ibid., para. 365). The 
Advisory Committee notes that those proposed changes would lead to an adjustment 
to the cost estimates originally set out by the Secretary-General in his report on the 
support account: estimated requirements for posts in the Field Budget and Finance 
Division would amount to $9,485,500, a decrease of $1,416,900, or 13 per cent, as 
compared with the original estimate of $10,902,400. There would be a corresponding 
increase of $1,874,800, or 32.4 per cent, in the estimated requirements for posts in 
the Peacekeeping Financing Division, taking the total amount requested from 
$5,787,700 in the Secretary-General’s original proposals to $7,662,500 (see 
A/67/756/Add.1, annex). 

75. The Secretary-General explains that 8 of the above-mentioned 12 posts (3 P-4 
and 2 P-3 posts of Finance and Budget Officer and 3 General Service (Other level) 
posts of Finance and Budget Assistant) would be assigned to three sections within 
the Peacekeeping Financing Division, which together deal with the preparation of 
budget/performance reports for 17 field missions (13 active, including UNSOA, and 
4 at various stages of closing) and trust funds. The Finance and Budget Officers 
would be responsible, inter alia, for reviewing and analysing data relating to the 
budget submissions; providing relevant support to managers at Headquarters and in 
the field; coordinating with missions and the Departments of Peacekeeping 
Operations and Field Support; and preparing budget proposals for the General 
Assembly, ensuring that the proposals were in conformity with the strategic 
guidance provided by the Under-Secretaries-General for Peacekeeping Operations 
and Field Support and that they met the needs of the intergovernmental bodies. The 
Finance and Budget Assistants would provide support to the Finance and Budget 
Officers. According to the Secretary-General, strengthening the capacity of the three 
sections would allow the section chiefs to focus on strategic analysis of 
peacekeeping budgeting rather than on operational reviews of budget submissions, 
and also reduce the burden of administrative tasks, increasing the time available for 
decision-making (A/67/756/Add.1, paras. 33-36). 

76. The four remaining posts (1 P-4 and 2 P-3 posts of Finance and Budget Officer 
and 1 General Service (Other level) post of Finance and Budget Assistant) would be 
assigned to the fourth section in the Peacekeeping Financing Division, which is 
responsible for preparing the budget and performance reports for the support 
account and UNLB, as well as for addressing cross-cutting issues relating to 
peacekeeping operations. The incumbents of the four posts would form a new team 
dedicated to policy guidance, coordination strategy and capacity development. They 
would support the work of the Division through the provision of advice, guidance 
and training on policies, practices and processes in the areas of budget and finance 
and would focus, in particular, on addressing the gaps listed in paragraph 38 of the 
addendum. They would be responsible for, inter alia, overseeing the development, 
coordination and implementation of support services to the field with a view to 



 A/67/848
 

27 13-32169 
 

improving the quality, timeliness and consistency of budget formulation, budget 
implementation, resource utilization monitoring and reporting. 

77. In addition to the increase in estimated requirements under posts, the proposals 
set out in the addendum to the support account report would lead to an increase in 
proposed resources under official travel for the Peacekeeping Financing Division of 
the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. The Secretary-General’s 
original cost estimates for official travel for that Office amounted to $141,500. His 
revised proposal includes estimated requirements of $341,500, an increase of 
$200,000, or 141.3 per cent. As indicated in the annex to the addendum, the higher 
requirements are attributable to the additional travel to be undertaken by the 
Peacekeeping Financing Division in order to enhance its outreach to field missions 
through mission visits and workshops, in coordination with the Field Budget and 
Finance Division, to clarify the roles and timelines for the budget process and to 
provide technical advice and guidance on results-based budgeting, staffing and 
financial resource requirements. 

78. The Advisory Committee sees merit in the Secretary-General’s proposals 
insofar as their aim is to improve the efficiency of a process that has long been 
recognized by all stakeholders as suboptimal. The Advisory Committee points 
out, however, that any business process transformation carries some risks. In 
this case, particular attention will need to be paid to ensuring that the 
mandated roles and responsibilities, as well as the accountability, of all actors in 
the process are respected at every stage. In addition, full and close cooperation 
among the Departments of Management, Peacekeeping Operations and Field 
Support will be critical to the success of the project. The Advisory Committee 
expects that the Secretary-General will take all necessary measures to address 
and minimize potential risks as the change process unfolds. 

79. Bearing in mind the foregoing considerations, the Advisory Committee has 
no objection to the Secretary-General’s proposals, recognizing that resources 
are needed at the beginning of a change process. The Committee considers, 
however, that as the process unfolds and stabilizes, there will be opportunities 
for further synergies and efficiencies through reductions in staffing levels. In 
particular, the improvements to the tools used during the budget preparation 
process, as well as the measures envisaged to address skill/knowledge gaps at 
Headquarters and in the field, should be one-time activities that will not be 
required on a permanent basis. With specific reference to the additional 
resources proposed for official travel by the Peacekeeping Financing Division, 
the Advisory Committee trusts that the Secretary-General will ensure that such 
travel is kept to a minimum. 

80. The Advisory Committee intends to review progress made in implementation 
of the budget process improvements as part of its consideration of the proposed 
budgets for peacekeeping operations for the 2014/15 financial period. 
 

  Impact of the budget process review on the overall resource requirements for 2013/14 
 

81. The impact of the budget process review on the proposed overall financial and 
human resources requirements of the support account for 2013/14 is reflected in the 
addendum to the budget proposal (A/67/756/Add.1, annex). It is shown therein that 
the total adjusted resource requirements for the support account for 2013/14 amount 
to $327,965,300 (gross), an increase of $9,972,300, or 3.1 per cent, compared with 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 28 
 

the appropriation for 2012/13 (see para. 31 above for the budget proposal contained 
in A/67/756). The adjusted estimates for post and non-post resources amount to 
$309,296,500 (excluding enterprise resource planning), representing an increase of 
$28,641,100, or 10.2 per cent, consisting of post resources ($220,119,200) and 
non-post resources ($89,177,300). The Advisory Committee was provided with a 
table of the adjusted resource requirements for the support account for 2013/14 
showing the overall post and non-post resources requested, and a breakdown of the 
resources under each department and office to be funded from the support account 
(see annex I). 

82. The adjusted estimates for 2013/14, as reflected in the addendum 
(A/67/756/Add.1), provide for 1,328 posts, compared with 1,325 posts proposed in the 
budget document (A/67/756). The net increase of three posts reflects: (a) a decrease in 
the number of posts proposed to be abolished from three to one in the Department of 
Field Support, bringing the total number of posts proposed to be abolished from 31 to 
29; and (b) the proposed conversion of one general temporary assistance position to a 
post in the Department of Management, which was proposed to be discontinued in the 
budget document, resulting in the total number of proposed general temporary 
assistance conversions from 57 to 58 (see paras. 45, 54, 74 and 79 above). The 
adjusted post requirements for the period 2013/14, by department and office, are 
contained in annex II to the present report. Annexes III to V contain the adjusted 
proposals for new posts, redeployments, reassignments, reclassifications and posts to 
be abolished for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014. 
 
 

 C. Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
 
 

 1. United Nations Office to the African Union  
 

  Collaboration between UNOAU and the Economic Commission for Africa 
 

83. The Advisory Committee recalls that UNOAU, established on 1 July 2010 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 64/288, integrated four entities located in 
Addis Ababa with separate mandates with regard to peace and security in Africa and 
that the Office became fully operational in August 2011 (A/66/779, para. 69). The 
Committee further recalls that, upon the establishment of the Office, it expressed the 
expectation that UNOAU would have close coordination with the Economic 
Commission for Africa (ECA), including co-location and the sharing of the support 
services of ECA (see A/64/792, para. 22). 

84. The Advisory Committee noted during its review of the budget for 2012/13 that 
owing to delays in the construction of the new building in which UNOAU was to be 
co-located with ECA, it was anticipated that efficiencies resulting from common 
services after co-location would be reflected only in the financial period 2013/14 (see 
A/66/779, para. 71). In this connection, the Committee notes that for 2013/14, 
UNOAU is proposing to abolish three posts (1 Security Officer (Field Service),  
1 Inventory and Supply Assistant (national General Service) and 
1 Telecommunications Assistant (United Nations Volunteer)) (see A/67/756, paras. 65-
67). Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the Office did not foresee any 
further reduction of staffing at this point, but would continue to assess its overall staff 
requirements on the basis of actual experience to be gained when the co-location of 
the two offices would materialize in the latter half of 2013. 



 A/67/848
 

29 13-32169 
 

85. The Advisory Committee was also informed, upon enquiry, that under the 
current memorandum of understanding, ECA provides common services in the areas 
of finance, travel, procurement, medical, transport and security, based on shared 
staffing resources (UNOAU staff embedded with ECA). The Committee recalls that, 
in order to address the constraints experienced by ECA in providing services to 
UNOAU, the latter had deployed, when required, up to six of its staff to work with 
their ECA counterparts to deliver specific services to UNOAU (see A/66/779,  
para. 71). In the view of the Advisory Committee, the information provided in 
the proposed budget for 2013/14 lacks clarity on the common services shared by 
UNOAU and ECA. The Committee reiterates its expectation that the two offices 
will take advantage of the planned co-location to realize demonstrable 
efficiencies in their operations (ibid.). Furthermore, the Committee requests 
that more detailed information on the sharing of common services and the 
potential reduction of resource requirements should be provided in the 
proposed budget for 2014/15. 
 

  Official travel 
 

86. The proposed requirement for official travel amounts to $359,300 for 2013/14, 
representing an increase of $94,500, or 35.7 per cent (see A/67/756, para. 70). The 
Advisory Committee notes that, of the total travel requirement proposed for 
2013/14, an amount of $114,300 (32 per cent) would cover trips to New York under: 
(a) mission planning/assessment/consultation ($52,900) for five persons for five to 
six days, including the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the Chief of 
Staff and the Chief of Political Affairs; (b) seminars/conferences/workshops 
($20,300) for five persons for five days, including staff working in the areas of 
political affairs, disarmament, administration, finance and budget; and (c) budget 
preparation/review ($41,100) for the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and three staff for five days to attend a budget hearing of the Advisory 
Committee on the support account (ibid., paras. 71, 73 and 74). Upon enquiry, the 
Advisory Committee was informed that the proposed provision for trips to New York 
under mission planning/assessment/consultation would also provide an opportunity 
for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to hold bilateral meetings 
with relevant Member States, members of the Security Council and international 
organizations, as well as workshops and conferences on issues related to the 
mandate of the Office, subject to requests and availability. 

87. The Advisory Committee points out that it has had hearings with UNOAU 
on its proposed budget under the support account, via videoconferencing, for 
the past two years and that the Committee is satisfied with the exchange with 
the Office. The Advisory Committee is therefore of the view that future budget 
hearings with UNOAU could be continued, via videoconferencing, for more 
efficiency gains. The Committee is also of the view that the Office should 
further prioritize its travel requirements by making optimal use of its trips to 
Headquarters under mission planning/assessment/consultation. 
 

 2. Office of the Under-Secretary-General 
 

  Establishment of the Office of the Director, Evaluation of Field Uniformed Personnel 
 

88. The Secretary-General is proposing to establish an Office of the Director, 
Evaluation of Field Uniformed Personnel, to provide an independent function of 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 30 
 

evaluation for field uniformed personnel through the provision of objective reviews, 
analysis, advice and recommendations on the effectiveness and efficiency of 
uniformed personnel in the field (ibid., paras. 84-91). The Office would have a total 
of five posts, consisting of two new posts (1 D-2 and 1 General Service (Other 
level)) and three reassigned posts (2 P-5 and 1 P-4). The Director would report 
directly to the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations. 

89. The Advisory Committee sought clarifications on a number of issues related to 
the proposal, in particular the added value of the new Office and its distinction from 
the existing evaluation functions. According to the information provided to the 
Committee, the current absence of a mechanism to evaluate and identify measures 
relating specifically to uniformed personnel has hampered the Organization’s ability 
to address contemporaneously systemic issues that affect the performance of 
uniformed personnel in peacekeeping operations. Within the Department, the 
performance of individual mission military or police components is currently 
evaluated, post facto, on the basis of reports or findings from end-of-assignment 
reports, field visits and technical and needs assessments. The Office of Military 
Affairs neither is mandated, nor has the capacity, to perform the functions envisaged 
for the new Office. The Police Division of the Office of Rule of Law and Security 
Institutions does not have an internal evaluation capacity to conduct evaluations to 
address systemic and systematic issues affecting the performance of formed police 
units. While the Policy, Evaluation and Training Division conducts five or six 
evaluations annually that focus on thematic issues, these evaluations may or may 
not include the activities of military and police components. The Committee was 
further informed that there would be no duplication of the work of OIOS in the area 
of investigations, as the new Office would not be charged with investigations related 
to the conduct of uniformed personnel. 

90. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee was informed by the Independent Audit 
Advisory Committee that it would be inappropriate for OIOS to evaluate military 
contingents and formed police units as proposed by the Secretary-General. The 
function to be performed by the new Office is an ongoing operational monitoring 
process that is a management responsibility and is not operationally “independent” 
in the same sense as the Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS. With respect 
to the Joint Inspection Unit, which is the United Nations system’s independent 
external oversight body with a broad focus and mandate, the Unit examines cross-
cutting issues across the participating organizations with the aim of enhancing 
administrative efficiency and achieving greater coordination among organizations. 

91. The Advisory Committee also enquired on the relationship between the proposal 
and the report of the Senior Advisory Group on rates of reimbursement to troop-
contributing countries and related issues (see A/C.5/67/10). The Committee was 
informed that, should the recommendations contained in the report of the Senior 
Advisory Group be endorsed by the General Assembly, the new Office could also be 
charged with evaluating the cross-cutting issues identified by the Senior Advisory Group 
that had an impact on the performance of uniformed personnel in mandate delivery and 
could also oversee the application of criteria set for the award of the premiums. 

92. As for the reporting lines of the Force Commanders and Police Commissioners 
in the context of the new Office, the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that 
they would have no direct reporting lines or accountability to the Director for 
Evaluation of Field Uniformed Personnel; rather, the work of the new Office would 



 A/67/848
 

31 13-32169 
 

assist the Force Commanders and Police Commissioners by addressing any specific 
or systemic issues that had impact on the ability of the uniformed personnel to carry 
out their mandated tasks in a holistic manner. The evaluations to be conducted by 
the Office would be undertaken in close collaboration and coordination with the 
relevant troop- and police-contributing countries, the senior leadership of missions, 
in particular the Force Commanders and/or Police Commissioners, and the 
Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support. 

93. Based on the information provided to it, the Advisory Committee has no 
objection to the proposed establishment of the Office of the Director, Evaluation 
of Field Uniformed Personnel, and the staffing requirement associated with the 
Office. The Advisory Committee expects, however, that the proposed Office will 
not have an impact on existing command and control arrangements for 
uniformed personnel, and specifically on the responsibilities of the Force 
Commanders and Police Commissioners in the field. 
 

 3. Office of Military Affairs 
 

  Reclassification of four seconded officer posts to civilian posts 
 

94. The Secretary-General is proposing to reclassify four seconded officer posts to 
civilian posts (P-4) in the Office of Military Affairs (see A/67/756, para. 126). 
According to the report, 110 of the 133 posts in the Office are reserved for seconded 
military officers who are rotated, on an average, every three years, which is not 
conducive to strong institutional memory and can result in the duplication of effort, 
steep learning curves and the loss of management continuity, thus having an adverse 
impact on the effectiveness of the Office. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee 
was informed that seconded military officers were offered an initial two-year 
contract, and extensions for an additional third year were considered on a case-by-
case basis. Currently, 18 officers were serving longer than three years (16 per cent), 
of whom 15 were expected to serve for four years, in the Office of Military Affairs, 
the integrated operational teams and in the Department of Field Support (6 posts of 
the Office of Military Affairs are assigned to the Department of Field Support: 4 in 
the Logistics Support Division and 2 in the Information and Communications 
Technology Division, pursuant to para. 35 of General Assembly resolution 62/250). 

95. The Advisory Committee recalls that the Secretary-General proposed to 
reclassify three seconded officer posts to civilian posts in the Office of Military 
Affairs in his budget for the support account for 2010/11, which the General Assembly 
did not approve at its sixty-fourth session. The Committee enquired as to what 
changes had taken place to justify the resubmitting of such a request, and was 
informed that OIOS, in May 2010, had conducted an audit to assess the operations of 
the Office of Military Affairs in deploying, supporting and monitoring military 
components in peacekeeping missions. OIOS observed that the frequent rotation of 
military staff resulted in the loss of institutional knowledge and a lack of management 
continuity and recommended the need to establish a mechanism to develop and sustain 
the institutional knowledge and management continuity within the Office. 

96. While the Advisory Committee understands that the rotations of seconded 
officers may have certain impact on the operation of the Office of Military 
Affairs, it is not convinced of the need to reclassify seconded officer posts to 
civilian posts on the basis of the justifications provided by the Secretary-
General. Further, the Committee is of the view that institutional memory can 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 32 
 

be maintained through a better arrangement within the Office, including the 
sequencing of rotations. The Committee, therefore, is of the view that the 
decision of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session should be 
maintained, and the Committee does not recommend approval of the request to 
reclassify the four seconded officer posts to civilian posts. 
 
 

 D. Department of Field Support 
 
 

 1. Office of the Under-Secretary-General 
 

  Restructuring of the Office and establishing the strategic support team and the 
operational support team 
 

97. The Secretary-General is proposing to reorganize the Office of the Under-
Secretary-General and the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General in order to 
strengthen the capacity of the Department to deliver strategic and operational 
leadership of its activities, by establishing, within existing resources, the strategic 
support team and the operational support team (see A/67/756, paras. 191-200). 

98. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that since the 
establishment of the Department of Field Support, experience had demonstrated that 
the four Divisions of the Department needed stronger executive oversight and 
management coordination in a number of key areas. While operations management 
in the Department was conducted largely at the divisional level, the integration, 
coordination and monitoring of day-to-day operations were carried out in a less 
systematic manner. Those functions had become all the more important with the 
expansion of complex mandates and increasingly critical for the effective 
implementation of the global field support strategy. Further, the two teams would be 
complementary and would work closely to ensure coherence of Departmental 
directives and actions. The chart below illustrates the proposed reporting lines of the 
two teams within the Department of Field Support. The Advisory Committee has 
no objection to the Secretary-General’s proposals.

 2. Field Personnel Division 
 

  Reorganization to a three-pillar structure 
 

99. According to the Secretary-General, the Division undertook a review of its 
functions in the context of the implementation of the global field support strategy, 
which led to the classification of such functions as either transactional or strategic. 
The review indicated the need for a reorganization of its structure to ensure full 
alignment with the vision of the strategy, with greater emphasis to be placed on the 
strategic elements of the human resources framework of the strategy (ibid.,  
para. 239). The proposed reorganization would establish a three-pillar structure 
within existing resources: the Operation Planning and Monitoring Service, the Field 
Human Resources Strategy Service and the Recruitment, Outreach and Career 
Development Section. Paragraphs 237 to 252 of the proposed budget provide more 
detailed information related to the proposal, with tables in paragraphs 237 and 240 
providing a breakdown of the current and proposed staffing requirements funded 
under both the support account and the programme budget. The Secretary-General 
proposes to abolish two posts of Human Resources Assistant (General Service 
(Other level)) owing to the expected efficiency gains resulting from the separation 
of transactional and strategic functions. 

100. In the view of the Advisory Committee, the three-pillar structure, which is 
being proposed on the basis of the classification of the transactional and strategic 
functions within the Field Personnel Division, lacks clarity on the different 
roles and responsibilities of the Office of Human Resources Management and 
the Division, in that the Office provides strategic policy guidance for the 
Organization as a whole, while the activities of the Division are of a more 
transactional nature. The Committee is of the view that further analysis and 
refinement are required for the reorganization of the Division and, therefore, a 
refined proposal could be submitted in the support account budget for 2014/15. 

101. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee notes that as the Division currently 
has a total of 65 General Service (Other level) posts and positions, it believes 
that it would be possible for the functions of the two Human Resources 
Assistant posts (General Service (Other level)), that are being proposed for 
abolishment to be absorbed by the existing capacity. The Committee, therefore, 
recommends acceptance of the proposal to abolish the two posts of Human 
Resources Assistant. 
 
 

 E. Department of Management 
 
 

102. A total amount of $3,711,500 is proposed under consultants for the Department 
of Management for the 2013/14 period, comprising: $97,500 for the Office of the 
Under-Secretary-General; $3,364,000 for the Office of Programme Planning, Budget 
and Accounts; $8,000 for the Office of Human Resources Management; and $242,000 
for the Office of Central Support Services. The Advisory Committee notes from the 
additional information provided to it upon request that there has been consistent 
underexpenditure under this budget line over the past five financial periods. While, in 
the light of the urgency of ensuring that peacekeeping missions are adequately 
prepared for the transition to IPSAS the Committee has no objection to the 
consultancy requirements relating to the implementation of IPSAS (see para. 112 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 34 
 

below), it recommends a reduction of $50,000 under consultants for the 
Department of Management. 
 

 1. Office of Human Resources Management 
 

  Outreach missions 
 

103. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 439 of the budget document 
that the Secretary-General is proposing an amount of $16,000 for the conduct of 
outreach activities, in collaboration with the Department of Field Support, to 
unrepresented and underrepresented Member States to encourage candidates to 
apply for positions in peacekeeping operations. 

104. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that seven outreach 
missions were planned for the budget period, to Brazil, Japan, Peru, Spain, the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of 
America and the Caribbean region (Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago). 
The Committee was further informed, upon enquiry, that during the 2011/12 period 
a total of $18,000 had been spent on outreach visits to the following countries: 
Costa Rica, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Panama, Pakistan, Poland, South Africa, the 
Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland and the United States of America. The relatively low level of expenditure in 
relation to the number of countries visited was attributable to the fact that the Office 
had combined trips to various countries in the same regions and had also 
collaborated closely with the Departments of Field Support and Safety and Security 
and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 

105. The Advisory Committee continues to support the outreach activities 
undertaken by the Office of Human Resources Management in order to address 
shortfalls in the staffing profile of peacekeeping operations and emphasizes, in 
particular, the importance of those activities as part of efforts to achieve 
organizational goals relating to gender balance, geographic diversity and the 
representation of troop- and police-contributing countries. 
 

  Inspira talent management system 
 

106. As indicated in paragraph 392 of the budget document, during the 2013/14 
period the Office of Human Resources Management will continue to implement the 
United Nations human resources reform agenda in field operations, using the new 
talent management system and its electronic support tool, Inspira. A number of 
outputs under expected accomplishment 3.1 (increased efficiency and effectiveness 
of field operations) reflect this aspect of the Office’s activities. 

107. The Advisory Committee recalls that the deployment of Inspira began in April 
2010 with the launch of the initial staffing module (that is, the posting of jobs for 
non-field locations) and an e-performance pilot. Subsequent releases of those 
modules were rolled out in 2011 and 2012 in order to stabilize and enhance them in 
light of difficulties experienced by some users (see A/66/779, para. 122). The 
Committee notes from the Secretary-General’s report that further progress has been 
made with the Organization-wide deployment of Inspira during the 2012/13 
financial period: In 2012, performance management was rolled out Secretariat-wide, 
and the enterprise learning module was piloted. In January 2013, the staffing 
module was launched in the field, beginning with MINUSTAH. Further roll-outs to 



 A/67/848
 

35 13-32169 
 

the field of the staffing, enterprise learning management, consultants, offer 
management, reference checking and position management modules are planned for 
2013 (see A/67/756, para. 426). 

108. The Secretary-General estimates that, in 2013/14, more than 44,000 United 
Nations personnel and over a million external candidates will use Inspira. He 
indicates that, at present, the system is heavily used, with over 100,000 log-ins per 
month (ibid.). 

109. Primary responsibility for providing development, maintenance, production 
and user support to Inspira, including in peacekeeping missions, rests with the 
Human Resources Information Systems Section. In addition to the resources 
proposed for posts and general temporary assistance that will be dedicated to Inspira 
implementation, the Secretary-General is requesting the following amounts for 
Inspira-related activities during the 2013/14 period: 

 • Under official travel, $12,000 to provide user support and training to mission 
personnel on the use of Inspira; $16,000 to provide technical support to ensure 
operational compliance and efficiency at the Inspira Support Centre in 
Bangkok; and $5,000 for training of staff of the Human Resources Information 
Systems Section on new versions of the software used to support the Inspira 
modules (see A/67/756, paras. 439 and 441); 

 • Under information technology, $1,577,000 for software, licences and fees 
associated with the proprietary software required for the Inspira system and 
the user base at Headquarters, as well as licence fees for hosting/on demand 
services for disaster recovery; and $416,000 for contractual services, 
representing 8,327 person-hours at a rate of $50 per hour, to cover low-level 
support during the retirement process of e-PAS, Galaxy and other legacy 
systems so that data from those systems will be available in Inspira during the 
decommissioning phase (ibid., paras. 443, 445 and 447); 

 • Under other supplies, services and equipment, $4,000 for materials and fees for 
training relating to the new versions of the Inspira software (ibid., para. 448). 

110. The Advisory Committee notes the progress made in the implementation 
of Inspira. The Committee trusts that the roll-out to the field will proceed on 
schedule and lead to the realization of the full benefits of the system, including 
an improvement in vacancy rates and greater efficiency in the management of 
recruitment, performance and learning. The Advisory Committee expects the 
Secretary-General to report on actual progress achieved in his next report on 
human resources management reform. 
 

 2. Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts 
 

  Consultants 
 

111. As indicated in paragraph 371 of the Secretary-General’s report, an amount of 
$3,364,000 is proposed for the engagement of consultants during the budget period. 
The Advisory Committee notes that all the consultancy requirements relate to the 
implementation of IPSAS in peacekeeping missions. They are broken down as 
follows: 

 • An amount of $3,080,000, corresponding to 216 person-months, for the 
engagement of consultants to support the deployment of the opening balance 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 36 
 

plan to produce the initial IPSAS statements, as well as the IPSAS-compliant 
recording of transactions during the first year of implementation and the 
critical IPSAS “dry-run” exercise (see A/67/756, para. 372); 

 • An amount of $5,000 for the engagement of one consultant with specialized 
expertise in the actual valuation of peacekeeping personnel benefits to assist in 
the reporting of actuarial variation and disclosure of liability as required under 
IPSAS (ibid., para. 373); 

 • An amount of $279,000 for the engagement of one consultant for 12 months to 
facilitate advanced-level instructor-led training on the preparation of IPSAS-
compliant financial statements and Umoja (ibid., para. 374). 

112. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in order to ensure that the United 
Nations transitions to IPSAS in 2014, as approved by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 60/283, field missions subject to the peacekeeping budget cycle must 
make available opening balances for assets by 1 July 2013, at the start of the 
2013/14 financial period, and issue IPSAS-compliant financial statements by 
30 September 2014, three months after the end of the financial period on 30 June 
2014 (see A/65/827, para. 171). Given the urgency of ensuring that, in 
accordance with the timeline approved by the General Assembly, peacekeeping 
missions are adequately prepared for the transition to IPSAS-compliant 
transaction processing from 1 July 2013, the Advisory Committee has no 
objection to the Secretary-General’s proposed resources for consultants (see 
also para. 102 above). The Committee expects, however, that IPSAS-related 
requirements under this and all budget lines will decrease significantly in the 
next budget period once the transition to IPSAS is complete. 
 

  Information technology 
 

113. The Secretary-General is proposing an amount of $730,300 for software 
licences and fees, comprising requirements for the maintenance and support of 
existing financial software and systems, including the Bloomberg Asset and 
Investment Management application, which is used for portfolio risk management 
(see A/67/756, para. 382). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that 
five staff members of the Treasury used the Bloomberg application, for which there 
were five terminals/licences. The cost per terminal/licence was $22,400 per year, 
amounting to a total of $112,000. In addition, the Organization paid a flat fee of 
$150,000 per year for the application, funded jointly from the regular budget 
($111,000) and the budget of the support account ($39,000). 
 

 3. Office of Central Support Services 
 

  Procurement Division 
 

114. The Advisory Committee recalls that the report of the Secretary-General on 
procurement activities (see A/67/683, sect. II.A) presented a new organizational 
structure of the Procurement Division and also provided details on the establishment 
of the Regional Procurement Office in Entebbe. The Advisory Committee reiterates 
its comments and recommendations concerning the Regional Procurement Office 
contained in its related report (see A/67/801, paras. 10-15). 

115. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the specific 
functions of the Regional Procurement Office at Entebbe were to: (a) procure goods

and services on behalf of the field missions in the region on the basis of joint 
acquisition plans, taking into account mission-specific requirements; (b) provide 
surge capacity during the start-up phase of field missions; (c) conduct vendor 
registration, including assisted registration on the premises of the Office; 
(d) conduct business seminars, especially in Africa; and (e) serve as a procurement 
training hub for the field missions in the region. The Committee was further 
informed that the Office was established as a section of the Procurement Division, 
and that the Chief of the Office had the same delegated authority as the other 
Section Chiefs of the Procurement Division. Furthermore, all procurement 
transactions processed by the Regional Procurement Office were subject to the same 
rules, procedures and internal controls applicable to the other sections of the 
Procurement Division, including review and approval by the Headquarters 
Committee on Contracts. 

116. From the outputs listed under expected accomplishment 3.1, the Advisory 
Committee notes that the Procurement Division will issue some 230 systems 
contracts, including amendments. The Advisory Committee enquired whether the 
number of systems contracts being established and managed by the Division was 
increasing or decreasing and the reasons for current trends. It was informed that 
systems contracts were, in principle, established for costly, critical and complex 
requirements common to the entire United Nations Secretariat, including 
peacekeeping operations. While the usage of systems contracts by field missions for 
their procurement needs had increased from 65 to 73 per cent over the period from 
2008 to 2011, there had been a decline in the overall number of systems contracts 
from 245 in 2008 to 214 in 2012. The decrease was owing mainly to a deliberate 
effort to focus Headquarters procurement on critical and complex contracts and to 
allow peacekeeping missions to handle less complex goods and services that could 
be procured locally. 

117. The Advisory Committee encourages the Secretary-General to pursue his 
efforts to expand registration of and increase procurement opportunities for 
local vendors. It also encourages the Secretary-General to continue to enhance 
the procurement skills of field mission staff and ensure application of best 
practices in peacekeeping procurement activities. 
 

 4. Office of Information and Communications Technology 
 

118. The Advisory Committee notes that the bulk of the resources proposed for the 
Office of Information and Communications Technology would be dedicated to the 
continued implementation of various information technology systems, including: the 
customer relationship management solution for troop-contribution management; the 
contingent-owned equipment application; the electronic fuel management system; 
the electronic rations management system; the enterprise information portal; the 
enterprise identity management system; and the electronic global warden system. 

119. In paragraph 505 of the budget document (A/67/756), the Secretary-General 
states that these initiatives do not overlap with, and are complementary to, the 
enterprise resource planning system, Umoja. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee 
was informed that the enterprise identity management system, which was required to 
identify Umoja users and facilitate management of access to the system, was a 
prerequisite to the deployment of Umoja. Systems such as the customer relationship 
management solution for contingent-owned equipment, the electronic fuel 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 38 
 

management system and the electronic rations management system provided 
functions that were not covered by the enterprise resource planning system, but 
would need to be closely integrated with Umoja. The Committee was also informed 
that there was no functional or operational need to interface to Umoja the other 
systems supported by the Office, such as the Contacts Database for the United 
Nations Operations Crisis Centre and the satellite Earth station, to provide back-up 
communications infrastructure. Upon enquiry as to the impact of the implementation 
of Umoja on the resource requirements for those systems, estimated at $4.35 million 
in 2013/14, the Committee was informed that the Office would continue to require 
resources for the maintenance of all those systems which would remain deployed 
after the full implementation of the enterprise resource planning system, scheduled 
in 2018. The Committee expects nevertheless that the requirements for the 
development/acquisition of those systems will be reduced over time, once they 
are fully deployed to all peacekeeping operations. 

120. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that: 

 (a) The contingent-owned equipment system had been deployed at UNIFIL, 
MINUSTAH, UNDOF, UNFICYP, MINURSO and UNISFA, and was planned to be 
further deployed to MONUSCO, UNSOA, UNMIL and UNOCI in 2012/13; 

 (b) The enterprise identity management system had been deployed at 
UNIFIL, UNMIL, MINUSTAH, UNDOF, UNFICYP, UNOCI, UNISFA and 
UNAMID, and was further planned to be deployed in MONUSCO, UNSOA, 
UNMISS and BNUB in 2012/13; 

 (c) The enterprise information portal was planned to be deployed at UNIFIL, 
MONUSCO, UNSOA and UNMISS in 2013/14, and it was anticipated that the 
system would be made available to all peacekeeping operations by the end of 2014; 

 (d) The functional requirements of the global warden system had evolved, 
and the specifications of the system were not yet finalized. 

The Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be requested 
to report on actual deployments of the above systems in his next report. 

121. With regard to the electronic fuel management system, the Advisory Committee 
notes that an in-house solution was developed and has been tested in MINUSTAH and 
that the system continues to be enhanced with a view to achieving a higher level of 
automation, further streamlining of data entry and eliminating data input errors. The 
Committee further notes that in 2013/14, it is planned to implement the system in two 
peacekeeping operations (see A/67/756, para. 496). The Committee reiterates the 
importance of an effective fuel management system for monitoring fuel 
consumption and strengthening internal controls, given the significant annual 
expenditures on fuel and the considerable risks of its misappropriation (A/66/779, 
para. 146). The Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be 
requested to expedite deployment of the system in all active peacekeeping 
operations and to report on achievements in his next progress report. The 
Committee discusses fuel management further in its report on cross-cutting issues 
related to peacekeeping operations (A/67/780). 

122. The Advisory Committee notes that after two failed attempts to acquire a 
commercial solution for the rations and food management system, the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology is developing an internal solution (see 



 A/67/848
 

39 13-32169 
 

A/67/756, para. 512). Upon enquiry the Advisory Committee was informed that the 
system was being developed using the customer relationship management software 
(iNeed) for front-office user functions and the SAP-enterprise resource planning 
software for back-office financial transactions. The system would be closely 
integrated with Umoja and could be implemented only after deployment of Umoja 
in peacekeeping operations. The Committee was further informed that a prototype 
covering the ingredient management, recipe definition and menu planning functions 
was available, and that planning for the deployment of the system had not yet 
commenced. A total of $547,457 has been spent thus far on the development of the 
system. The Advisory Committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring that 
the rations management system is fully integrated with Umoja. It remains 
concerned by the continued delays in the implementation of the rations 
management system. It considers the implementation of an effective solution 
for the management of rations to be very important both to ensure food safety 
and quality, which affects the health and morale of contingent personnel, as 
well as to improve controls and cost-effectiveness in the utilization of resources. 
The Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to 
accelerate the development and deployment of the system and to report on 
progress achieved in his next report. The Committee discusses rations 
management further in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping 
operations (see A/67/780).  
 
 

 F. Office of Internal Oversight Services 
 
 

  Investigations Division 
 

  Comprehensive report on the pilot project and proposed restructuring 
 

123. A description of the proposed structure of the Investigations Division and 
resource utilization is provided in paragraphs 529 to 544 of document A/67/756. 
Compared with its current presence in New York, Vienna, Nairobi and seven 
peacekeeping missions during the pilot project, the proposed new structure of the 
Division would comprise an office in New York and regional offices in Vienna and 
Entebbe, as well as resident investigator offices in five missions (MONUSCO, 
MINUSTAH, UNMIL, UNMISS and UNOCI). The current and proposed locations 
and staff assignments/deployment are illustrated in tables in paragraphs 531 and 532 
of the proposed budget. The approved staffing of the Division, as per the pilot 
project, comprises 51 general temporary assistance positions, and it is proposed to 
convert the 51 positions to posts for 2013/14 (2 D-1, 3 P-5, 15 P-4, 20 P-3,  
1 General Service (Professional level), 8 General Service (Other level) and  
2 national General Service). 
 
 

 G. Administration of justice 
 
 

  Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services 
 

  Proposed conversion of two general temporary assistants positions to posts 
 

124. The Secretary-General is proposing the conversion of two general temporary 
assistance positions (1 P-4 and 1 General Service (Other level)) to posts in the 
Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services (see A/67/756, 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 40 
 

paras. 592-595). The Office currently has an approved staffing of seven posts and 
two general temporary assistants positions. The Advisory Committee notes, from the 
budget and from information provided to it upon request, that while the annual 
caseload of the Office showed an increasing trend for the past three periods from 
2009/10 to 2011/12 (401, 606 and 628, respectively), it appears that the trend is 
reversing for the current period (452 cases as at 19 March 2013 and approximately 
600 cases for the period). Further, for 2013/14, the Office expects that at least 500 
cases will be received. Taking into account the evolving yet decreasing number 
of cases dealt with by the Office in the current period, the Advisory Committee 
is of the view that the staffing requirements should be kept under review in 
tandem with the caseload of the Office. The Committee, therefore, does not 
recommend, at this stage, approval of the proposed conversion of the two 
general temporary assistants positions to posts for 2013/14 for the Office of the 
United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services. 
 
 

 H. Ethics Office 
 
 

  Consultants 
 

125. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 618 of the budget document 
(A/67/756) that a provision of $672,000 ($405 per statement per person) is proposed 
for a consulting firm to continue the independent review of staff statements in 
connection with the financial disclosure programme, based on the quote from the 
firm that would conduct the review for 2013/14. The unit cost appeared to be high in 
the view of the Committee, and it enquired about the current rate and negotiations 
undertaken to reduce the cost. The Committee was informed that the Procurement 
Division was currently negotiating a successor contract and that the new unit cost 
would be available upon the finalization of the negotiation (the standard unit cost 
for each review was $398 for 2012/13). The Advisory Committee expects that the 
Secretary-General will make further efforts to reduce unit cost in the 
negotiation with the consulting firm. 

126. It is proposed that the responsibility to oversee the due diligence review 
process of selected vendors, by a consultant, be transferred from the Procurement 
Division to the Ethics Office, in order to ensure the independence of the review and 
to avoid conflict of interest (ibid., para. 619). Upon enquiry, the Advisory 
Committee was informed that the selection of the corporate compliance consultant 
would be an open competitive process and that the consultant, who would have no 
decision-making role, would provide confidential findings to the Director of the 
Ethics Office. The qualifications and expertise required of the consultant would 
include, inter alia: (a) proven expertise in public procurement, corporate 
compliance, and business ethics; (b) comprehensive knowledge of sanctions and 
debarment procedures in procurement by governments and international 
organizations; (c) experience in developing, monitoring, assessing and managing 
corporate ethics and compliance programmes; (d) advanced competency and 
knowledge of international best practices in the areas of ethics, compliance and anti-
corruption, and related international instruments; and (e) familiarity with the 
regulations and rules of the United Nations. 
 



 A/67/848
 

41 13-32169 
 

  Communications 
 

127. The higher requirements ($18,000) are attributable to the purchase of 
videoconferencing equipment and videoconferencing charges, which the Office used 
to share with the Department of Field Support (see A/67/756, para. 629). The 
Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the Ethics Office was able to 
use videoconferencing equipment belonging to the Department of Field Support 
until the end of 2012, when the Office and the Department were located in the same 
building. The Committee was also informed that with the Office’s relocation to the 
Daily News Building, no such facility is readily available and that ethics 
consultations often involved matters of a highly confidential nature. While the 
Advisory Committee understands the nature of the work involved by the Ethics 
Office, it has always encouraged the use of videoconferencing by the 
Organization whenever feasible and appropriate. It believes that the Ethics 
Office should continue to share videoconferencing equipment with other offices 
of the Secretariat. The Committee, therefore, recommends a reduction of 
$18,000 under communications proposed for the purchase of the 
videoconferencing equipment. 
 
 

 I. Office of Legal Affairs 
 
 

  General Legal Division 
 

  Proposed conversion of three general temporary assistants positions to posts 
 

128. The General Legal Division has three general temporary assistance positions 
funded from the support account: one Legal Officer for Accountability and Judicial 
Support Matters (P-4); and two Legal Officers for Administration of Justice Matters 
(1 P-4 and 1 P-3). The Secretary-General is proposing to convert the three positions 
to posts for the period 2013/14 (ibid., paras. 636-642). 

129. In its consideration of the system of administration of justice at the United 
Nations, the Advisory Committee expressed the view that an interim independent 
assessment of the system is now required and that the outcome of this interim 
assessment could also inform future decisions regarding the alignment of resources 
among relevant offices handling different aspects of the system of administration of 
justice (A/67/547, para. 12). The Committee recalls that the General Assembly has 
requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Assembly, for consideration at its 
sixty-eighth session, a proposal for conducting an interim independent assessment 
of the formal system of administration of justice (see resolution 67/241, para. 19). 
Pending the outcome of the interim independent assessment, the Committee 
does not recommend approval, at this time, of the proposed conversion of the 
two positions of Legal Officer for Administration of Justice Matters (1 P-4 and 
1 P-3). The Advisory Committee, however, has no objection to the conversion to 
a post of the position of Legal Officer for Accountability and Judicial Support 
Matters (P-4). 
 
 



A/67/848  
 

13-32169 42 
 

 J. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
 
 

130. Information on the support provided to peacekeeping missions by the Office 
and its cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is contained in 
paragraphs 695 to 701 of the proposed budget for 2013/14. It is indicated therein 
that no resources have been provided to the Office under the support account. The 
Secretary-General is proposing to establish three posts in the Office as follows: 
(a) one Chief of Service at the D-1 level and one Human Rights Officer at the P-3 
level in the Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division at Headquarters; 
and (b) one Human Rights Officer at the P-4 level in the Research and Right to 
Development Division in the Office in Geneva (ibid., paras. 702-716). 

131. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Office has five 
posts to support peacekeeping operations funded under the regular budget, which 
were approved by the General Assembly in resolutions 56/255 and 60/246, 
respectively. The Advisory Committee was also informed, upon enquiry, that the 
New York office of OHCHR had a total of 24 staff: 15 funded from the regular 
budget (1 Assistant Secretary-General, 1 P-5, 5 P-4, 3 P-3 and 5 General Service 
positions) and 9 from extrabudgetary resources (2 P-5, 6 P-4 and 1 P-3), as well as 
one Associate Expert. 

132. Taking into account the existing capacity of the Office in New York  
(24 staff), the Advisory Committee is of the view that the functions to be 
performed by the incumbent of the D-1 post should be accommodated within 
the existing capacity of the Office, and the Committee, therefore, does not 
recommend approval of the establishment of the D-1 post. The Committee has 
no objection to the proposed establishment of the P-3 and P-4 posts. It is not, 
however, fully convinced of the need for the proposed support to peacekeeping 
operations by the Office from two distinct locations and requests that the 
Secretary-General provide a fuller justification to the General Assembly at the 
time of its consideration of the proposed budget for the support account for 
2013/14. 
 
 

 VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
 
 

133. In the present report, the Advisory Committee recommends the following:  

 (a) Post requirements: (i) establishment of 58 of the proposed 63 new 
posts, and against approval of 5 posts comprising the conversion of 4 general 
temporary assistance positions (2 P-4, 1 P-3 and 1 General Service (Other 
level)) and the establishment of one post (D-1) (see paras. 43 and 44 above); 
(ii) abolishment of 29 posts (see paras. 45 and 82 above); and (iii) approval of 
10 of the 15 reclassifications proposed (see paras. 48-49 above); 

 (b) Non-post requirements: (i) continuation of a total of 78 positions 
under general temporary assistance (comprising 74 positions proposed by the 
Secretary-General and continuation of 4 positions proposed for conversion to 
posts) (see paras. 44 and 54 above); approval of one new position and 
discontinuation of three positions (see paras. 54, 74, 79 and 82 above); 
(ii) reduction of $50,000 under consultants in the Department of Management 
(see paras. 58 and 102 above); (iii) overall reduction of 10 per cent under the 



 A/67/848
 

43 13-32169 
 

proposed requirement for official travel ($1,119,460) (see para. 62 above); and 
(iv) reduction of $18,000 under communications (see paras. 64 and 127 above). 

134. The above-mentioned recommendations of the Advisory Committee would 
represent a reduction of $5,343,300 to the proposed budget of the Secretary-
General. Accordingly, the proposed budget for the support account for 2013/14 
would be reduced from $327,965,300 to $322,622,000. This amount includes 
$215,372,400 for the post resources and $88,580,800 for the non-post resources 
for the support account, and $18,668,800 for the enterprise resource planning 
project requirements. 

135. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the 
financing of the peacekeeping support account for the periods 2011/12, 2012/13 
and 2013/14 are set out in paragraph 45 of the addendum to the budget 
document (A/67/756/Add.1).8 The Advisory Committee recommends that the 
General Assembly: 

 (a) Request the Secretary-General to make every effort to absorb the 
projected overexpenditures, and that it decide on additional requirements, if 
any, for the 12-month period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, taking into 
account the most up-to-date information on actual and projected expenditures, 
as well as on incumbency rates at the time of its consideration of the proposed 
budget for 2013/14 (see para. 30 above); 

 (b) Approve the support account requirements in the amount of 
$322,622,000 for the 12-month period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014; 

 (c) Decide to apply the following in respect of the financial period from  
1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012: (i) the unencumbered balance of $6,000 and (ii) the 
total amount of other income amounting to $3,134,900, comprising interest 
income ($883,400), other miscellaneous income ($111,300), cancellations of 
prior-period obligations ($2,141,300) and prior-period adjustments ($1,100), to 
the support account requirements for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 
2014; 

 (d) Apply the excess of the authorized level of the Peacekeeping Reserve 
Fund in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2012 in the amount of 
$1,245,800 to the support account requirements for the period from 1 July 2013 
to 30 June 2014.
