3. As an immediate practical measure to complement the
ongoing search for a more fundamental solution to the
financial problems of the United Nations, the Secretary-
General proposes, in paragraph 2 of his report, that Member
States establish a Revolving Credit Fund, initially capitalized
at a level of up to $1 billion through voluntary contributions
or any other means of financing that Member States may wish
to suggest.

General will have if Member States fail to respond to his
notification or do not indicate the future date of payment of
unpaid assessments. The Committee points out that, according
to the Secretary-General, such notification will allow him to
pledge it as security for borrowing at such time as he
considers necessary from the Revolving Credit Fund
(A/52/822, para. 2). Furthermore, the Committee questions
the linkage between the treatment of retained surpluses and
the Revolving Credit Fund.
6. The Advisory Committee is also concerned that, on the
one hand, the proposed establishment of the Revolving Credit
Fund may put additional burden on those Member States that

already fully meet their financial obligations and, on the other
hand, it may not induce delinquent Member States to pay their
contributions in full and on time, nor will it induce them to
provide voluntary contributions to the Fund.
7. The Advisory Committee points out that the financial
crisis of the United Nations results from the lack of political
will of some Member States to pay their assessed
contributions in full, on time and without conditions. This is
a political rather than a financial problem and, as such, it
cannot be successfully resolved by technical means.
Moreover, the creation of the Revolving Credit Fund may
dilute the attention of Member States towards finding an
effective political solution to the financial crisis of the
Organization.
8. In view of the comments and observations above, the
Advisory Committee will refrain from commenting on the
operations and procedures of the Revolving Credit Fund until
such time as the General Assembly pronounces itself on the
principles involved.
