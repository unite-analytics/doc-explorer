Programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001

Final appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the final appropriation for the
biennium 2000-2001 (A/56/866). During its consideration of the report, the
Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information and clarifications.

2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 56/240 A of 24 December 2001, took
note of the second performance report of the Secretary-General on the programme
budget for the biennium 2000-2001 (A/56/674) and the related report of the
Advisory Committee (A/56/694) and approved a combined revised appropriation
and commitment authority of $2,561,578,000. As indicated in paragraph 1 of the
report of the Secretary-General, “the Assembly also decided, in the light of the need
for precision in determining the required final level of appropriations and
assessments, that it would revert to consideration of the final appropriation at its
resumed fifty-sixth session in March 2002”.

3. As indicated in paragraph 5 of the report, pending a determination of the final
level of appropriations and income, no assessment action was taken at the main part
of the fifty-sixth session to reflect the changes in requirements vis-à-vis the revised
appropriation and estimates of income approved by the Assembly in its resolutions
55/239 A to C of 23 December 2000. In its resolutions 55/239 A to C, the Assembly
approved a revised appropriation of $2,533,125,400 and a revised estimate of
income of $380,822,700.

4. The annex to the report shows a final level of expenditure of $2,561,186,900,
or a decrease of $391,100 as compared with the revised appropriation and
commitment authority approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 56/240 A,
and a final income estimate for the biennium of $383,415,200, or an increase of
$3,741,700 over the provisional estimate approved by the Assembly in its resolution
56/240 B.

5. The Committee received detailed information on the budget performance in
respect of the financial period 2000-2001, which is contained in the annex to the
present report. The Committee was informed that a rigorous exercise had been
undertaken to evaluate the validity of the unliquidated obligations. As can be seen
from that annex, unliquidated obligations of $74,936,000 in respect of 2000-2001
represent 2.9 per cent of expenditure, a significant decrease as compared with the
previous two bienniums. The Committee welcomes this development; it points out
that, as a consequence, significant savings should not be expected as the result of
any future cancellations of obligations for 2000-2001. Amounts resulting from
cancellations of any obligations would be confirmed after the audit relating to the
biennium 2002-2003, which will be reported by the Board of Auditors and
considered by the General Assembly in autumn 2004; Member States would
therefore be credited in 2005.

6. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve
the final appropriation resolution for the biennium 2000-2001 as set out in the
annex to the report of the Secretary-General. In so doing, the General
Assembly will have also approved the necessary transfers among sections.
