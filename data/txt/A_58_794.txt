Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Financing arrangements for the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. By its resolution 58/259 of 23 December 2003, the General Assembly decided
to appropriate the amount of $59,038,300 for the maintenance of the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) for the
period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004, in addition to the amount of $582 million
already appropriated and apportioned for the same period under the terms of
resolution 57/335 of 18 June 2003.  On the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the additional amount of
$59 million was not assessed on Member States on the understanding that the
Advisory Committee would review the situation at the time of its consideration of
the estimates for the 2004/05 period.

2. As indicated in the note by the Secretary-General on the financial
arrangements for MONUC (A/58/772), it is anticipated that the Mission will fully
utilize the amount of $641,038,300 appropriated by the General Assembly for the
maintenance of the Mission. The projected full utilization is attributable primarily to
the full deployment of military contingents. The Secretary-General therefore
requests apportionment of the additional $59,038,300 in order to ensure the timely
reimbursement of troop-contributing Governments and the payment of mission
subsistence allowance to military observers, civilian police and international civilian
staff, as well as to meet payroll costs and contractual obligations for the acquisition
of equipment and for services rendered to MONUC.

3. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of MONUC for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 is indicated
in paragraph 5 of the aforementioned note by the Secretary-General. The Advisory
Committee recommends that the amount of $59,038,300 be assessed and
apportioned among Member States.
