Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.71

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with
rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly on the budget
implications of draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.71 (A/C.5/56/L.28).

2. As indicated in the statement, under the terms of operative paragraph 8 of draft
resolution A/C.2/56/L.71 the General Assembly would request the Secretary-
General to launch a public information campaign to raise global awareness of the
World Summit on Sustainable Development, including through reprioritization of
the budget of the Department of Public Information and voluntary contributions.

3. The Committee recalls that paragraph 26.9 of the proposed programme budget
for 2002-2003 indicated that the level of resources for public information did not
include any provision for the information activities associated with special meetings
or conferences to be scheduled for the biennium, and that should the Department be
requested to carry out such activities, such necessary resources would be sought
through the presentation of statements of programme budget implications.

4. The Committee notes that for the purpose of highlighting the goals and
purposes of the Summit, to be held in Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September
2002, and the sessions of its preparatory committee, the Department of Public
Information, in collaboration with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
will develop an information strategy. The total estimated costs for the public

information activities described in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the statement submitted by
the Secretary-General amount to $352,500.

5. With regard to draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.71, upon enquiry, the Committee
was informed that the issue of prioritization could only be handled in the context of
the provisions of General Assembly resolutions 41/213 and 42/211, and that no
voluntary contributions were available.

6. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the
General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.71, expenditures
would arise not exceeding $352,500 under section 26, Public information, of the
proposed programme budget for 2002-2003, and that additional appropriations
would be considered by the General Assembly in accordance with the procedures set
out in General Assembly resolutions 41/213 and 42/211 for the use and operation of
the contingency fund.
