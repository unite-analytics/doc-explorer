for Disarmament Research resulting from the

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The General Assembly, in section III of its resolution 58/272 of 23 December
2003, requested the Secretary-General to report at the main part of its fifty-ninth
session on the continuing need for a subvention to the United Nations Institute for
Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) from the regular budget of the United Nations,
taking into account previous reports and any relevant decisions on the question of
subventions.

2. The Advisory Committee has considered the notes by the Secretary-General
(A/C.5/59/3 and Corr.1 and Add.1) on the request for a subvention of $227,600 for
2005 and on the continuing need for this subvention to UNIDIR resulting from the
recommendation of the Board of Trustees of the Institute on the work programme of
the Institute for 2005.

3. UNIDIR was established in October 1980 pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 34/83 M of 11 December 1979 for the purpose of undertaking
independent research on issues of disarmament and international security as an
interim arrangement within the framework of the United Nations Institute for
Training and Research (UNITAR). The General Assembly in section IV of its
resolution 37/99 K of 13 December 1982 on institutional arrangements relating to
the process of disarmament, provided that the Institute should function as an

autonomous institution, working in close relationship with the Department of
Disarmament Affairs, and that its activities should be funded by voluntary
contributions from States and public and private organizations. In the same
resolution, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to give the
Institute administrative and other support and decided that the Advisory Board on
Disarmament Studies should function as its Board of Trustees. In that capacity, the
Advisory Board was mandated to draft the statute of the Institute.

4. The General Assembly approved the statute of UNIDIR by its resolution
39/148 H of 17 December 1984. With regard to the financial arrangements of the
Institute, the statute stipulated that voluntary contributions from States and public
and private organizations should form the principal source of financing of the
Institute and that a subvention towards meeting the costs of the Director and the
staff of the Institute might be provided from the regular budget of the United
Nations. With a view to ensuring that the Institute not be funded from the
subvention alone, it further specified that the amount of the subvention should not
exceed an amount equivalent to 50 per cent of the assured income of the Institute
from voluntary sources.

5. Over the course of the past 10 years, the subvention has not exceeded 34 per
cent of voluntary contributions, and has fallen to approximately 15 per cent in more
recent years, well below the 50 per cent ceiling authorized. A subvention of
$146,500 was initially provided to UNIDIR in 1985. It was subsequently set to
$220,000 in 1990 and then reduced to $213,000 in 1996 owing to system-wide
reductions. Following the in-depth evaluation of the disarmament programme by the
Office of Internal Oversight Services in 2000 (E/AC.51/1999/2), which indicated an
erosion of the value of the subvention in real terms, the General Assembly, in its
resolution 55/35A of 20 November 2000, recommended the development of
proposals to increase funding of the Institute within existing resources. In this
regard, as of the biennium 2002-2003, the subvention was cost-adjusted.

6. In his report A/C.5/59/3/Add.1, the Secretary-General confirmed the
continuing need of a subvention and stressed its importance, both for assuring the
independence of the Institute and, therefore, an unbiased research programme, as
well as for assisting the Director in raising voluntary funds. The Secretary-General
also pointed out that the impartiality and independence of the Institute is essential in
an area as sensitive as disarmament and international security in order to ensure that
the work of the Institute is not compromised, which would inevitably lead to
difficulties in attracting further voluntary contributions.

7. In the Secretary-Generalâ€™s report A/C.5/59/3, a subvention of $227,600 was
requested from the regular budget of the United Nations to UNIDIR for 2005. The
amount represents approximately 15 per cent of the total voluntary funds available
in 2005 and has been cost-adjusted to take inflation and currency changes into
account.

8. The Advisory Committee accepts the justification provided for the
continuing need for a subvention to the Institute from the regular budget of the
United Nations. It recommends that the General Assembly approve the request
of $227,600 for UNIDIR for 2005 on the understanding that no additional
provision would be required under section 4, Disarmament, of the programme
budget for 2004-2005.
