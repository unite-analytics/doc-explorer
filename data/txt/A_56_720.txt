Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/56/31), in
accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, on the
programme budget implications of draft resolution A/56/L.62.

2. The Advisory Committee recalls that, pursuant to General Assembly resolution
55/174 A of 19 December 2000 on the situation in Afghanistan and its implications
for international peace and security, the mandate of the United Nations Special
Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), established under resolution 48/208 of 21
December 1993, was extended from 1 January to 31 December 2001.

3. As indicated in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the statement, under the terms of draft
resolution A/56/L.62, the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan would
continue its primary role in conducting United Nations peacemaking activities in
Afghanistan; efforts of UNSMA in helping the interim authority to implement the
political aspects of the Bonn agreement would be intensified.

4. Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/56/L.62, the Secretary-
General estimates that requirements of $7,355,400 would arise in respect of
requirements for 2002 under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget for
the biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/6 (sect. 3)). The Committee notes that a provision of
$93.7 million is included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-

2003 for special political missions. According to the Secretary-General, should the
General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/56/L.62, the estimated requirements of
$7,355,400 would be charged against the provision of $93.7 million for special
political missions under section 3, Political affairs, of the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 2002-2003.

5. The current structure of the Mission provides for 21 posts in the Professional
and above category (1 Assistant Secretary-General, 1 D-1, 5 P-5, 7 P-4 and 7 P-3), 5
General Service posts, 6 Field Service posts, 49 Local level posts and 4 military
observers. As indicated in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the statement, the Secretary-
General proposes that in 2002 the staff of the Mission be strengthened by one
additional D-1 post to head the Political Section of the Mission, two new Civil
Affairs Officer posts (P-4) and two new Field Service posts (1 Security Coordinator
and 1 Air Safety Officer); moreover, the upgrading of a P-5 post to the D-1 level is
requested for the Civil Affairs Coordinator. The number of military observers for
2002 would be reduced from four to three.

6. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of annex I B to the statement
that the costing of salaries and common staff costs in 2002 assumes a vacancy rate
of 12 per cent for both international and local staff; this assumption reflects the
actual vacancies in the Mission during the period 2000-2001, as well as the
expectation that positions would be filled faster during 2002. In this connection, the
Advisory Committee notes that the performance report for the Mission for the
period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001 reflects savings of $1.2 million,
which resulted mainly from the high vacancy rate (16 per cent) in international and
local staff (see paragraph 2 of annex III B to the statement).

7. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform
the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/56/L.62, an
amount of $7,355,400 would be charged against the provision of $93.7 million
for special political missions requested under section 3, Political affairs, of the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.
