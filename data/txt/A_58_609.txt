Transfer of buildings to the United Nations Logistics Base
at Brindisi

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the note by the Secretary-General on the transfer of buildings to the
United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi (A/58/596). During its consideration of
the matter, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General.

2. The Government of Italy has indicated its willingness to transfer to the United
Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi five additional buildings with a total floor space
of 1,760 square metres. The buildings are located within the premises of the
Logistics Base and would be accommodating the assets of the strategic deployment
stocks and other Logistics Base requirements. The existing Logistics Base building
and the five additional buildings would be used to house the Logistics Base
headquarters, its Air Operations Unit and the staff canteen, and for the storage of
assets and materials (see A/58/596, para. 1).

3. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that, for comparison purposes
only, the market rental value of the equivalent space has been estimated at $561,715
per annum, and the alternative of constructing containerized offices would require
an additional amount of $985,671. The renovation and maintenance costs of the five
buildings would be borne by the United Nations at a cost of some $140,000 for
renovations and, thereafter, about $15,000 per annum for maintenance. The
appropriation for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 for the Logistics Base
would cover the additional costs for that period (ibid., para. 2). As the acceptance of
the buildings would involve additional financial liability for the United Nations in
respect of the cost of their maintenance, the approval of the General Assembly is
sought, consistent with financial regulation 3.11 (ibid., para. 3).

in support of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
