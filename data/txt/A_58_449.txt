of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of
International Humanitarian Law Committed in the
Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 for the
biennium 2004-2005

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed requirements for the
biennium 2004-2005 of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia (A/58/226). The Committee also took note of the report of the Secretary-
General on the progress made by the Tribunal in reforming its legal aid system
(A/58/288). During its consideration of the reports, the Committee met with the
Prosecutor, Deputy Prosecutor and the Registrar of the Tribunal and with
representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.

2. The Advisory Committee has also considered the report of the Secretary-
General on the supplementary estimates arising in respect of Security Council
resolution 1503 (2003) on the establishment of a Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (A/58/368). The Committee’s comments and
recommendations on those estimates, which also have an impact on the budget of
the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (see paras. 16, 19 and 25 below), are
contained in its report on the proposed budget for the Rwanda Tribunal.

3. As indicated in the introduction to the proposed budget (A/58/226, paras. 3-4),
the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, in
April 2002, presented a report on the judicial status of the Tribunal and the



2
A/58/449

prospects for referring certain cases to national courts. The report contained a
completion strategy, which provided for setting 31 December 2008 as the date for
completion of first-instance trials and 31 December 2010 as the date for completion
of appeals. The report of the President of the Tribunal was endorsed by the Security
Council on 23 July 2002 (S/PRST/2002/21).

4. The Advisory Committee observes that the completion strategy of the Tribunal
comprises two main pillars, namely: (a) the fair and expeditious completion of trials
by the Tribunal in accordance with the time line set for the completion strategy; and
(b) the transfer of cases against accused persons detained under the authority of the
Tribunal to national courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

5. The Secretary-General indicates in the proposed budget that in support of the
first pillar, the Tribunal will continue to undertake six concurrent trials through the
use of 16 permanent and 9 ad litem judges and to complete all related appeals in the
most expeditious manner (A/58/226, para. 6). The Advisory Committee notes that
the Office of the Prosecutor will strive to meet the goal of bringing all priority
investigations to the indictment stage by the end of 2004 and that, as investigations
are completed, a gradual reduction in posts will be effected in 2005 within the
Investigations Division, resulting in the abolition of 43 posts and the redeployment
of 18 posts to other priority areas of the Tribunal (see ibid., para. 8).

6. As far as the second pillar is concerned, the Secretary-General indicates that a
transition team will be established within the Office of the Prosecutor to oversee:
(a) the preparation of the transfer of cases from the Tribunal to the State court in
Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of the completion strategy; and (b) the
preparation of dossiers for all other lower-level war crime perpetrators identified
during investigations, with a view to transferring those dossiers to the appropriate
prosecuting authorities in the countries of the former Yugoslavia (ibid., para. 10).
The Advisory Committee was informed that 17 cases involving 62 suspects were
currently being considered for transfer to national courts, as follows: 12 cases (48
suspects) to the courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina; 3 cases (8 suspects) to the courts
of Croatia; and 2 cases (6 suspects) to the courts of Serbia and Montenegro. The
Committee was provided, upon request, with additional information on the role of
the transition team for courts in Croatia and in Serbia and Montenegro, which is
contained in annex I below.

7. The Advisory Committee was provided with information and statistics, as at
September 2003, on activities carried out from 1996 to 2003:

(a) 38 individuals have been convicted by trial chambers;

(b) 1 individual has been acquitted in the first instance and 4 have been
acquitted by the Appeals Chamber;

(c) 18 convictions have been sustained by the Appeals Chamber;

(d) 18 cases involving 29 accused persons have reached the pre-trial stage;

(e) 3 trials involving 4 accused persons are ongoing, 4 persons involved in 2
cases are awaiting judgement by the trial chamber, and 6 accused persons who have
pleaded guilty are awaiting sentencing;

(f) 7 cases involving 12 accused persons are at the appeals stage, and 8
interlocutory appeals are pending;



3
A/58/449

(g) Arrest warrants have been publicly issued for 16 accused, who are still at
large;

(h) 15 accused persons have pleaded guilty.

II. Proposed budget for the biennium 2004-2005

8. The Advisory Committee notes with satisfaction that the proposed budget
of the Tribunal for the biennium 2004-2005 has for the first time been
presented in a results-based format, as requested by the General Assembly in
its resolution 57/288 of 20 December 2002. In the opinion of the Committee, the
presentation represents an improvement in the state of results-based budgeting.

9. The resource requirements proposed for the Tribunal for the biennium 2004-
2005 under assessed contributions are estimated at $262,283,100 gross
($234,808,500 net), before recosting (see ibid., table 2). This represents a decrease
of $370,600 gross, ($992,500 net) compared with the appropriation for the biennium
2002-2003. The Committee points out that those estimates include a provision of
$4,518,100 representing the delayed impact of the establishment of 90 posts for the
Tribunal during the biennium 2002-2003. After recosting, estimated at $67,333,000
gross ($63,878,500 net), the proposed resource requirements for 2004-2005 amount
to $329,616,100 gross ($298,687,000 net). However, the decision of the Security
Council to establish the new position of Prosecutor of the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (resolution 1503 (2003)) entails a decrease in the estimated
resource requirements for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia in the amount of $2,293,100 gross ($1,915,200 net), thus reducing
overall requirements to $327,323,000 gross ($296,771,800 net) for the biennium
2004-2005 (see A/58/368, para. 12).

10. Since the estimates before recosting represent a decrease as compared with the
revised appropriation for the biennium 2002-2003, the increase of nearly 25 per cent
in resource requirements, even after the reduction attributable to the creation of the
post of Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is attributable
to recosting. The largest components of the recosting are the impact of the projected
fluctuations in the exchange rate ($45,567,900) and inflation ($12,151,700) (see
A/58/226, para. 19). Moreover, the recosting includes a provision of $5,899,200
reflecting adjustments to standard salary costs. Annex II below, submitted by the
Secretariat, contains budgetary assumptions used in formulating the proposed
budget for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. As shown
therein, the budget estimates were calculated on the basis of a projected exchange
rate of €0.89 to US$ 1.

11. The Advisory Committee points out that the value of the United States
dollar to major world currencies has been volatile during the past 12 months.
The Committee reiterates its view on the issue of recosting resulting from
currency fluctuations.1

12. Total extrabudgetary resources for the biennium 2004-2005 are estimated at
$7,252,200, reflecting a decrease of 42.2 per cent, as compared with voluntary
contributions of $12,555,100 for 2002-2003 (ibid., table 2). The Advisory
Committee was informed upon enquiry that the reduction in extrabudgetary



4
A/58/449

resources resulted from the anticipated completion by the end of 2003 and 2004 of a
number of projects in the areas of exhumations, investigations and prosecution.

13. The proposed staffing table of the Tribunal for the biennium 2004-2005 (see
ibid., table 3) provides for 1,018 assessed budget posts (not including 16 permanent
and 9 ad litem judges) and 18 extrabudgetary posts, reflecting the abolition of 43
assessed budget posts (34 Professional and 9 General Service), the conversion to
temporary status of three posts currently funded from general temporary assistance
(2 P-4 and 1 P-3), the upward reclassification of one P-4 and four P-3 posts and a
number of internal redeployments (see ibid., para. 18).

14. Moreover, as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on supplementary
estimates arising in respect of Security Council resolution 1503 (2003) (A/58/368,
paras. 10-12), the decision of the Council to establish the post of Prosecutor for the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will entail a further reduction of 10
assessed budget posts (8 Professional and 2 General Service) for the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, thus bringing the total number of
assessed budget posts for the biennium 2004-2005 to 1,008 (469 Professional and
539 General Service).

15. The budget estimates assume a vacancy factor for continuing posts of 6.5 per
cent for the Professional and higher categories of staff and 4.0 per cent for the
General Service and related categories (see annex II below). The Advisory
Committee was provided with vacancy statistics by organizational unit of the
Tribunal as at 30 September 2003, which indicated a vacancy rate of 7.8 per cent in
the Professional category and 4.6 per cent in the General Service category in the
Office of the Prosecutor and 7.5 per cent in the Professional category and 7.0 per
cent in the General Service category in the Registry. Given that it will likely be
increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff as the date for completion of the
work of the Tribunal draws nearer, it is unlikely that these vacancy statistics
will improve significantly, if at all, even with the reduction in the overall
number of posts described in paragraph 13 above.

A. Chambers

16. The Advisory Committee notes that the budget estimate for the Chambers is
not affected by the decision of the Security Council to create the new position of
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The resource
requirement for the Chambers for 2004-2005 amounts to $9,000,400 gross before
recosting, as compared with the appropriation of $8,776,200 gross for the biennium
2002-2003, reflecting resource growth of $224,200, or 2.6 per cent (see A/58/226,
table 2). The total provision of $9,000,400 gross includes $8,823,600 for salaries
and allowances for 14 permanent and 9 ad litem judges, $30,500 for consultants and
experts and $146,300 for travel of the President of the Tribunal and the judges. The
salaries and allowances of the judges have been calculated on the basis of the terms
and conditions of service as established by the General Assembly in its resolutions
53/214 of 18 December 1998, 55/249 of 12 April 2001 and 56/285 of 27 June 2002.
The next comprehensive review of the emoluments, pensions and other conditions of
service of the judges is to be undertaken during the fifty-ninth session of the
Assembly. The Committee notes that the estimates may need to be adjusted in the
light of decisions taken at that time.



5
A/58/449

17. In the supplementary information provided to the Advisory Committee,
requirements for travel are estimated at $146,300, reflecting resource growth of 24.2
per cent. That amount includes a provision of $32,000 to cover the travel and
incidental expenses of the judges to a European State in connection with a seminar.
Upon request, the Committee was informed that nine judges had spent a total of 58
days on extrajudicial activities during 2002 while on official travel and that eight
judges had spent 24 days on official travel as at the end of September 2003. The
Committee recalls its view that the judicial activities at The Hague should have
priority over public relations activities and attendance at external meetings (see
A/55/642, para. 28); therefore the Committee welcomes the decrease in travel of
the judges in 2003.

18. The Advisory Committee notes that by the end of the biennium 2004-2005, it
is expected that the Chambers will have completed 12 trials, 12 pre-trial procedures,
6 pre-appeal procedures, 8 appeals from final trial chamber judgements and all
interlocutory appeals arising from the above (see A/58/226, para. 23). The
Committee was provided with projected workload indicators for the organs of the
Tribunal for the biennium 2004-2005. For the Chambers, the Committee notes that
the number of court sessions will increase from the 3,402 estimated for 2002-2003
to 3,956 projected for 2004-2005 (based on the new method for counting sessions
introduced as from January 2002, whereby one court day equals four sessions: two
in the morning and two in the afternoon).

B. Office of the Prosecutor

19. The Advisory Committee reiterates the need for close coordination
between the two Tribunals and, with the appointment of a separate prosecutor
for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, trusts that steps will be
taken to ensure the continuation of this collaboration in all areas of the work of
the two Tribunals.

20. The proposed budget for the Office of the Prosecutor for the biennium 2004-
2005 amounts to $79,134,500 gross (before recosting), a decrease of $2,756,200
gross, or 3.4 per cent, compared with the appropriation of $81,890,700 gross for the
biennium 2002-2003. Recosting the provisions to 2004-2005 rates would increase
them by $20,801,400 to a total of $99,935,900 gross (see ibid., table 2). The
decision to create a new position of Prosecutor of the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda entails a decrease in the estimated resource requirements for
the Office of the Prosecutor in the amount of $2,293,100 gross, thus reducing the
assessed budget requirements for the Office to $97,642,800 gross for the biennium
2004-2005 (see A/58/368, table 4).

21. The proposed staffing requirements for the Office of the Prosecutor for 2004-
2005 reflect the abolition of 43 posts and the redeployment of 13 posts to the
Registry (see A/58/226, para. 39). Moreover, the decision of the Security Council to
create a new position of Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda entails a further reduction of 10 posts for the Office of the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for the biennium 2004-
2005, thus bringing the total proposed staffing requirements of the Office to 354
posts (215 Professional and 139 General Service).



6
A/58/449

22. As indicated in the proposed budget, 34 investigator posts (16 P-3 and 18 P-2)
would be abolished effective 1 July 2005, and 9 General Service (Other level)
administrative posts in the Skopje and Pristina field offices would be abolished
effective 1 January 2005 (see ibid., para. 17 (a)). The Advisory Committee notes
that while all investigations will be brought to the indictment stage by the end of
2004 (see ibid., para. 8), a reduction in investigator posts will not start before 1 July
2005; no time frame is given for the redeployment from the Investigations Division
of 13 posts (2 P-4, 7 P-3, 2 P-2 and 2 General Service (Other level)) to the Registry
and 5 posts within the Office of the Prosecutor (1 P-3 and 2 P-2 to the Immediate
Office of the Prosecutor and 2 P-4 to the Prosecution Division). The Advisory
Committee notes that even after all the abolitions and redeployments, 120
Professional and 36 General Service posts would remain in the Investigations
Division. According to the Secretary-General, those posts would be required to
support all phases of the prosecution process in addition to providing support for the
preparation of cases and dossiers for referral to local jurisdictions, as envisaged in
the completion strategy (see ibid., paras. 30-36). The Committee points out in this
connection that the process of determining the number of posts to be abolished,
redeployed or retained does not appear to be transparent from either the
budget document or the supplementary information provided to the
Committee, nor is it supported by a thorough analysis of workload indicators.
The Committee requests that the volume of work and the pace of completion of
the related activities, especially in the Office of the Prosecutor, be continuously
monitored in order to determine whether some of the posts involved could be
abolished or released for transfer to other areas of the Tribunal before the
second half of 2005. Subject to that request, in order to ensure that the
completion strategy is adhered to, the Committee recommends acceptance of
the staff capacity proposed for the Office of the Prosecutor.

23. The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information provided
to it that the requirements of the Office of the Prosecutor for overtime are estimated
at $279,000, reflecting an increase of $89,800, or 47.5 per cent. According to the
Secretariat, this increase relates primarily to the additional work required by the trial
support staff. The Committee points out, however, that on the basis of the
available documents it was not in a position to ascertain whether any attempt
had been made to quantify or justify either the total or the additional resources
requested. The same comment of the Committee applies to the Office’s
requirements for consultants, which are estimated at $387,500, reflecting an
increase of $80,800, or 26.3 per cent. According to the Secretariat, approximately
104 consultants would be required during the biennium for up to 520 days, which
would involve related travel costs. The Committee points out that at the stage
when an important element of the Tribunal’s functions, such as investigations,
is expected to be substantially curtailed during the biennium 2004-2005, any
increase in resource requirements for the biennium should have been explained
and justified much more thoroughly.

24. The supplementary information provided to the Advisory Committee indicates
travel requirements of $4,717,000 for investigations and prosecutions, which
amounts to a decrease of $1,588,100, or 25.2 per cent. According to the Secretariat,
a decrease in investigative travel is not expected until the end of 2004. The
Committee notes, however, that certain support functions of the Office of the
Prosecutor will be affected by the reduction in investigative activities during 2004.



7
A/58/449

For example, the Skopje and Pristina field offices would be closed at the end of
2004. The Committee is of the view that the volume of investigative activities
will not stop abruptly at the end of 2004 but will decrease gradually throughout
the year. With regard to prosecution-related travel, the Committee notes from the
Tribunal’s workload indicators that the number of witnesses interviewed is
anticipated to decline from 6,300 during the biennium 2002-2003 to 3,000 during
the biennium 2004-2005. This should, therefore, reduce the need for travel for the
purpose of preparing witnesses to give evidence. Therefore, the Committee is of
the view that further reductions are possible in the requirements proposed for
investigative and prosecution-related travel in the Office of the Prosecutor.

C. Registry

25. The resource requirements for the Registry for the biennium 2004-2005 are
estimated at $174,148,200 gross (before recosting), an increase of $2,161,400, or 1.3
per cent, over the 2002-2003 appropriation of $171,986,800 gross (see ibid.,
table 2). In addition, it is estimated that the Registry will administer extrabudgetary
resources amounting to $5,567,700, as compared with $5,736,300 estimated for
2002-2003 (ibid., table 8). The budget estimates for the Registry are not affected by
the Security Council’s decision to create the new position of Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

26. The staffing establishment of the Registry in the proposed assessed budget for
2004-2005 comprises 654 posts (254 Professional, 245 General Service and 155
Security Service), reflecting the inward redeployment of 13 posts from the
Investigations Division of the Office of the Prosecutor, the conversion to temporary
status of three posts (2 P-4 and 1 P-3) currently funded from general temporary
assistance funds and 5 reclassifications (1 P-4 and 4 P-3). The Advisory Committee
sought clarification with respect to the information contained in paragraphs 18 (f)
and 44 of the budget document and was informed that the two liaison officer posts in
Belgrade and Sarajevo would be established, effective July 2005, through the
redeployment of 2 P-3 posts from the Office of the Prosecutor.

27. The breakdown by organizational unit of the 13 posts (2 P-4, 7 P-3, 2 P-2 and
2 General Service (Other level)) proposed for redeployment from the Investigations
Division of the Office of the Prosecutor to the Registry is as follows:

(a) Redeployment of 2 P-2 posts and 1 General Service (Other level) post to
the Victims and Witnesses Section, effective January 2005;

(b) Redeployment, effective January 2005, of 2 P-4 posts and, effective July
2005, of 4 P-3 posts to the Chambers Legal Support Section;

(c) Redeployment of 1 General Service (Other level) post to the Detention
Unit, effective January 2005;

(d) Redeployment of 2 P-3 posts to the Registry Advisory Section, effective
July 2005;

(e) Redeployment of 1 P-3 post to the Human Resources Section of the
Division of Administration, effective July 2005.

The Advisory Committee concurred with the proposed redeployment of 13 posts
from the Investigations Division of the Office of the Prosecutor to the Registry (see



8
A/58/449

also para. 22 above). However, the Committee sought clarification with regard to the
redeployment of two P-4 and four P-3 posts to the Chambers Legal Support Section.
The Committee was informed that the four P-3 posts were to be subsequently
reclassified to the P-4 level. The Committee finds the proposal for such
reclassification to be inconsistent with United Nations budgetary practices. It
was informed that the redeployments and subsequent reclassifications would
allow all six trial sections in the Chambers Legal Support Section, which are
currently managed by a legal officer at the P-3 level, to be headed at the P-4
level. The Committee points out that currently the six trial sections are
organizationally structured into three trial chambers headed by a senior legal
officer at the P-5 level, and the Committee does not consider that there is a
need to introduce yet another layer of hierarchy.

28. Moreover, the Advisory Committee points out that the proposed
redeployments are to be carried out in July 2005, or six months before the end
of the biennium. The Committee is of the view that the proposal to redeploy
two P-4 posts to the Chambers Legal Support Section does not constitute
evidence in support of the proposal that all six trial sections need to be headed
at the P-4 level with effect from July 2005. The Committee requests that the
need to reclassify the P-3 posts be reviewed and, if the reclassification is found
to be justified, that the request be resubmitted in the context of the proposed
budget for the next biennium. At this stage, therefore, the Committee does not
recommend the reclassification of the four P-3 posts.

29. As far as the proposed reclassification of a P-4 post to the P-5 level is
concerned, the Advisory Committee notes that the proposal is made in respect of the
post of Chef de Cabinet in the Office of the President. Information in support of the
proposal is contained in paragraph 17 (b) of the proposed budget. The Committee
recommends approval of the reclassification.

30. With regard to the proposed conversion of three posts (2 P-4 and 1 P-3)
currently funded from general temporary assistance to temporary status for oversight
functions, the Advisory Committee notes that the financing of the three posts was
approved during the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/58/226, para. 17 (d)). The
Administration indicates that the oversight functions would be required on a
continuing basis for the duration of the Tribunal’s mandate. The proposed budget
reflects a corresponding reduction of $452,500 in general temporary assistance due
to the proposed conversion. The Committee points out that the proposal for
conversion appears to be consistent with its previous observation with regard to the
need to consider the issue of providing resources on a continuing basis for audit and
investigations under the biennial budget of the Tribunal (see A/56/717, para. 7). The
Committee recommends acceptance of the requested conversion.

31. The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information provided
to it that a provision of $302,800 (before recosting) is made under consultants and
experts, reflecting an increase of $114,100, or 60.4 per cent. According to the
Secretariat, the increase is due in part to the anticipated increase in the number of
expert witnesses called to testify. However, as shown in workload indicators
provided by the Secretariat, the number of witnesses for the biennium 2004-2005 is
projected to remain at the current level of 70. The Committee believes, therefore,
that there is room to adjust those estimates.



9
A/58/449

32. The travel requirements for the Registry for 2004-2005 amount to $4,590,200
(before recosting), a decrease of $52,800. They comprise $1,035,100 for official
travel of staff and $3,555,100 for travel and allowances of witnesses, support
persons and dependants and other related costs. A total of 1,344 witnesses and
support persons would travel to The Hague during the biennium 2004-2005,
compared with 1,292 for the biennium 2002-2003. The Advisory Committee was
provided, upon request, with additional information on the estimates for travel of
witnesses, which is contained in annex III below.

33. The Advisory Committee notes that the provision for travel of staff includes
requirements for the recruitment and testing of language staff and for coordinating
with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The Committee points out in
this connection that the workload related to the recruitment and testing of
language staff is unlikely to be as heavy as in the past since most of the initial
recruitment has been completed. The Advisory Committee welcomes and
stresses the need for continuing coordination and collaboration between the
two Tribunals in all areas of activity. However, with the establishment of a post
of Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the need for
travel in order to coordinate with the Rwanda Tribunal during the biennium
2004-2005 may not be as pressing as it was when one Prosecutor served the two
Tribunals. The Committee is of the view, therefore, that there is room for
adjustment in the proposed requirements for travel of Registry staff.

34. The Advisory Committee recalls that in the past it has expressed concern
regarding the control and management of contractual services, particularly with
regard to defence counsel (see, for example, A/55/642, paras. 53-59).2 The
Committee also recalls that it had requested that information be provided on the
management of the legal aid programme of the Tribunal (see A/57/593, para. 28).
The General Assembly, in its resolution 57/288 of 20 December 2002, requested the
Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report on the progress made by the
Tribunal in reforming its legal aid system, particularly with regard to rationalizing
the costs of defence counsel and establishing indigence, and the Secretary-General
submitted a report pursuant to that request (A/58/288). The Advisory Committee
welcomes the efforts and measures to rationalize the costs and improve the
effectiveness of the legal aid system, in particular the appointment of a
financial investigator in March 2003 to assess the ability of the accused to cover
the costs of defence. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General, full legal
aid has already been cut back to partial legal aid for six accused, based on
interviews and evidence gathered during field missions. Additional investigations
are under way that promise additional savings (ibid., para. 41).

35. From the documentation available to it, the Advisory Committee was not in a
position to ascertain what effect the measures outlined in the report on the legal aid
system had on the estimated resource requirements of $29.5 million for defence
counsel for the biennium 2004-2005, even though, according to the supplementary
information provided to it, the estimates took into account the application of the
revised system of paying for trials adopted as from July 2002. Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that since the introduction of the new system a number of
new factors have kept defence costs relatively high, namely: (a) the issuance of
indictments against high-profile accused, which has resulted in an increase in the
proportion of highly complex and difficult cases; and (b) the unanticipated level of
resort by accused persons to rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which



10

A/58/449

has resulted in exceptional levels of post-trial disclosure. According to the
Secretariat, under the old payment system the above factors would have undoubtedly
generated additional costs; furthermore, another advantage of the new system is that
the duration of trials is expected to be reduced, as defence lawyers will no longer
have an incentive to prolong cases.

36. The Advisory Committee requests that detailed information be provided
to it in the context of the next budget estimates for the Tribunal on the
effectiveness of the measures outlined in the report of the Secretary-General on
the legal aid system.

37. The Skopje and Pristina field offices will be closed at the end of 2004 (see
para. 24 above). The Advisory Committee was informed that, although savings
would be achieved owing to the closure of the Skopje office, which is located in
commercial premises, additional resources would be required to rent a commercial
premises for the Banja Luka office following the closure of the United Nations
Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Committee was also informed, upon
enquiry, that all requirements related to the Skopje and Pristina offices have been
budgeted for 2004 only, including temporary posts and related mission subsistence
allowance payments, as well as general operating expenses (rent, utilities, cleaning,
insurance, petrol, etc.).

III. Conclusions and recommendations

38. In paragraphs 22, 23, 24, 28, 31 and 33 above, the Advisory Committee
has made a number of observations and recommendations with regard to the
resource requirements of the Tribunal. Inasmuch as the Committee does not
wish to impede the completion strategy of the Tribunal, it is not recommending
specific reductions under any particular item, although significant economies
should be achieved. Given the comments of the Committee in paragraphs 10
and 11 above with respect to budgeting for currency fluctuations, it is not
necessary, in the opinion of the Committee, to appropriate and assess at this
stage the full recosting provision projected for the next two years. Instead, the
General Assembly may wish to request the Secretary-General to report on
additional requirements, if any, that would arise from currency movements at a
time when a more complete picture of exchange rates has emerged, namely, in
December 2004. On this basis, and taking into account its comments above
about the potential for economies under a number of objects of expenditure,
the Committee recommends that the estimated requirements for the Tribunal
for the biennium for 2004-2005 be reduced by $20 million gross.

Annex I
Office of the Prosecutor’s transition team

The role of the Office of the Prosecutor’s transition team in dealing with the
issue of transferred or referred cases is expected to be broadly the same in terms of
activities and workload for all three jurisdictions where the cases will be transferred
or referred to, whether Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia or Serbia and Montenegro.
The transfer or referral of cases to the local courts in the former Yugoslavia needs to
be considered in three parts.

First, it is expected that some cases that have been commenced by the Tribunal
by the issuance of an indictment may be referred back for prosecution in the local
courts, pursuant to rule 11 bis of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
The Prosecutor anticipates that about three cases in this category, involving four
fugitives, may be referred to the State court in Bosnia and Herzegovina, assuming
the fugitives are apprehended.

Second, there are the priority B cases. These are cases that the Prosecutor has
suspended and that will not result in indictments being issued by the Tribunal before
the end of 2004. Given more time and resources, these cases would have been
indicted by the Tribunal, but this would have to occur after the end of 2004. It
should be stressed, however, that there is no intention to prosecute these cases
before the Tribunal or to issue indictments. There are 17 investigations in this
category, involving approximately 62 suspects. It is the Prosecutor’s intention to
refer the responsibility for the further investigation and ultimate prosecution of all
of these cases to the local authorities in the former Yugoslavia. It is expected that of
these 17 cases, 12 (involving 48 suspects) will be referred to the State court of
Bosnia and Herzegovina; 2 cases (involving 6 suspects) will be referred to the courts
of Serbia and Montenegro; and 3 cases (involving 8 suspects) will be referred to the
courts of Croatia. The transition team will play a substantial role in preparing these
cases, including dossiers of information and evidence, for transfer to those courts in
the former Yugoslavia.

Third, there are all of the low-level perpetrators who have been identified
during the course of the Tribunal’s investigations since 1994. There are literally
thousands of suspects in this category. Many of them are responsible for very
serious crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, but because of the
relatively low level of responsibility, these suspects were never considered
appropriate for prosecution by the Tribunal. The evidence relating to these
perpetrators will be compiled into separate dossiers of evidence and information,
and will be delivered to the local authorities for further investigation and
prosecution in the domestic courts of the former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, and probably the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia. The transition team will also play a very significant role in
the preparation of these dossiers.

Annex III
Estimates for travel of witnesses

The provisions for travel and accommodation costs for witnesses and support
persons are based on a total of 1,344 witnesses and support persons, of which 1,200
are witnesses and 144 are support persons.

The estimates have been calculated on the assumption that 1,200 witnesses will
travel to The Hague during the biennium for hearings and trials. The International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia also allows eligible witnesses, with the
approval of the Registrar, to be accompanied by support persons and dependants. It
is estimated that 12 per cent of witnesses will be eligible for this privilege.
Therefore, provisions for travel and accommodation costs for witnesses and support
persons are based on 1,344 persons (1,200 plus 12 per cent).

Anticipated expenses for transportation to The Hague and travel documents for
witnesses ($875 per person) total $1,176,000 for the biennium. In addition,
accommodation and meals are contracted directly by the Tribunal with local hotels
at an average of $130 per person per day for seven days each ($1,223,000). A
witness allowance is also paid for incidental expenses at €30 per day (US$ 32 per
day, totalling $301,100). The total costs for witnesses and support persons amount to
$2,700,100.

A further provision is requested for working accommodations for witness
assistants in hotels where witnesses are lodged. Witness assistants are provided 24
hours a day in order to provide a focal point for witnesses queries or problems and
so need to be provided with private accommodations from which to work. Working
accommodations for witness assistants is contracted at the same rate as witness
accommodations, even though three different assistants may use the accommodation
in a 24-hour period. A provision of $360,000 is requested for 3,600 days for the
biennium, at $100 per day.

Witness escort ($495,000). Victims and Witnesses Section staff are required to
accompany high-risk witnesses from their homes to the courts and back again. This
task includes not only the physical escort of the witnesses but also liaison with
national and local authorities in the field to ensure that witnesses are put under the
least possible stress. The estimate is based on 550 trips at $900 per trip (including a
reduced 40 per cent daily subsistence allowance payment).
