Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.78

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/56/29) in
accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, on the
programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.78.

2. As indicated in paragraph 1 of the statement, when adopting draft resolution
A/C.2/56/L.78, the Second Committee was informed that the programme budget
implications for the adoption of the draft resolution were contained in the report of
the Secretary-General (A/56/645 and Add.1 and Add.1/Corr.1 and Corr.2) and that
the provision for the requirements for the implementation of the draft resolution
would be decided in accordance with the recommendation of the Fifth Committee.

3. The Advisory Committee notes that, under the terms of operative paragraphs 1,
2 and 9 of draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.78, the General Assembly would:

(a) Establish the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed
Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, as
proposed by the Secretary-General in paragraph 16 of his report;

(b) Request the Secretary-General to take immediate measures to make the
Office operational as soon as possible;



2
A/56/716

(c) Decide that the provisions of the resolution would be implemented within
the approved level of the biennium 2002-2003 budget and request the Secretary-
General to seek voluntary contributions for the Office.

4. The Advisory Committee also notes that the activities to be carried out by the
Office of the High Representative relate to programme 8, Africa: New Agenda for
Development, and programme 9, Trade and development, of the medium-term plan
for 2002-20051 and to sections 10 and 11A of the proposed programme budget for
the biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/6 (sects. 10 and 11A), respectively. The key
functions of the Office of the High Representative, which reproduce those contained
in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General, are listed in paragraph 5 of
his statement.

5. As shown in table 2 and indicated in paragraph 10 of the statement, total
requirements would amount to $3,906,400, of which a provision for $3,055,600
would be approved under a new section, 9A, Office of the High Representative for
the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island
Developing States, and another for $850,000 under section 27D, Office of Central
Support Services. The proposal would also result in reductions of $709,900 and
$1,975,800 under section 10, Africa: New Agenda for Development, and section
11A, Trade and development, respectively, of the proposed programme budget for
the biennium 2002-2003, as a result of the transfer of activities to the new section
9A. In view of the foregoing, as indicated in paragraph 25 of the statement, the total
net additional requirements for the establishment of the Office of the High
Representative amount to $1,220,700.

6. The staffing proposed, shown in table 1, includes a total of 13 regular budget
posts (9 Professional posts, including 1 Under-Secretary-General, and 4 General
Service). This would be achieved by the establishment of one Under-Secretary-
General and one D-2 level post and the redeployment of three posts from
subprogramme 1 (Mobilization of international support and global coordination) of
section 10, Africa: New Agenda for Development (1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1 General Service)
and of eight posts from section 11A, Trade and development (1 P-5, 2 P-4, 1 P-3,
1 P-2 and 3 General Service). It is also indicated that it is anticipated that six other
posts (1 P-5, 1 P-3, 3 General Service) would be seconded from other organizations
or provided through extrabudgetary resources.

7. The amount indicated for non-post resources, out of the total requirements in
table 2, amounts to $1,231,400 or to $1,128,400, out of the net total requirements of
$1,220,700. This is mostly due to estimated total requirements of $850,800 for
rental of premises and alterations ($522,800 and $328,000, respectively) of the
space in New York, which would arise under section 27D, Office of Central Support
Services, as indicated in paragraphs 22 and 23 of the statement.

8. The Advisory Committee notes that the statement submitted by the Secretary-
General only provides the proposed post and non-post changes resulting from the
establishment of the Office of the High Representative. It does not provide any
indication of the impact of the changes proposed upon the other entities involved or
of its related programmatic effects on sections 10 or 11A. In this connection, the
statement is also lacking as to how the operational capacity of the organizations and
bodies of the system, in particular the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), will be enhanced in their activities aimed at supporting
developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, landlocked

developing countries and small island developing States (see operative para. 3 of
draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.78).

9. In view of the decision contained in operative paragraph 1 and the request
contained in operative paragraph 2 of draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.78, the
Advisory Committee recommends the establishment of the Office of the High
Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing
Countries and Small Island Developing States and of a post at the Under-
Secretary-General level to carry out the functions indicated in paragraph 5 of
the statement (see also para. 17 of the report of the Secretary-General). The
Advisory Committee also recommends that the Fifth Committee take note of
the proposal to provide up to 12 other posts for the Office, but that it defer a
decision on the permanent establishment of these posts under the new section
9A until submission of a report by the Secretary-General on the programmatic
implications and impact on the activities of the affected sections of the
programme budget, namely 10 and 11A. The report should also contain a
carefully articulated indication of resources required, including total
availability of posts, either seconded from other agencies in the system or to be
funded from available voluntary contributions.

10. In addition, the report should address how the operational capacity of the
organizations and bodies of the system, in particular UNCTAD, will be
enhanced in their activities aimed at supporting developing countries, in
particular the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and
small island developing States, as the Secretary-General is called upon to do in
operative paragraph 3 of draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.78, and how system-wide
coordination is to be achieved. Upon inquiry, the Advisory Committee was
informed that two posts (one full-time and one part-time) currently deal with
this issue within UNCTAD. Information should also be provided at the regional
level, taking into account the role of the regional commissions indicated in
paragraph 10 of the report of the Secretary-General.

11. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform
the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/C.2/56/L.78, net
additional appropriations up to $1,220,700, as specified in paragraph 27 of the
statement submitted by the Secretary-General, would be required at this stage,
subject to the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency fund, it
being understood that this amount would be adjusted in the light of the report
requested above.
