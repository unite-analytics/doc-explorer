The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons
in all its aspects

Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.1/56/L.47

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/56/13) on the
programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.1/56/L.47. During its
consideration of the document, the Committee met with representatives of the
Secretary-General who provided additional information.

2. Under the terms of operative paragraphs 1 and 2 of the draft resolution, the
General Assembly would decide to convene a Conference, no later than 2006, to
review progress made in the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent,
Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its
Aspects, the date and venue to be decided at its fifty-eighth session, and to convene
a meeting of States on a biennial basis, commencing in 2003, to consider national,
regional and global implementation of the Programme of Action.

3. Under the terms of operative paragraphs 10 and 12 of the draft resolution, the
Secretary-General would be requested to undertake a United Nations study,
commencing during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, within available
financial resources and with any other assistance provided by States in a position to
do so, and with the assistance of governmental experts appointed by him on the
basis of equitable geographical representation, to examine the feasibility of
developing an international instrument to enable States to identify and trace, in a
timely and reliable manner, illicit small arms and light weapons. The Secretary-
General would also be requested, within existing resources, through the Department
of Disarmament Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, to collate and circulate

data and information provided by States on a voluntary basis, including national
reports, on the implementation by those States of the Programme of Action.

4. In connection with the Conference to be convened no later than 2006, the
Advisory Committee notes from paragraphs 10 and 14 of the statement of the
Secretary-General that it is not possible at this point to estimate the conference-
servicing and related resource requirements.

5. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 9 of the statement submitted
by the Secretary-General that the conference-servicing requirements for the biennial
meeting of States referred to in paragraph 2 above are estimated at $362,600, and
that the conference-servicing requirements for three sessions of the group of
governmental experts referred to in paragraph 3 above are estimated at $715,100.
Since provision for conference services was made under the relevant sections of the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003, no additional
appropriation would be required for conference-servicing costs.

6. Related resource requirements would comprise two new posts (one P-4 and
one General Service), five work-weeks of consultancy services and resources for the
travel of up to 20 experts. The total estimated cost of these additional requirements
would amount to $559,800, as follows: $456,100 under section 4, Disarmament;
$59,900 under section 27 D, Office of Central Support Services; and $43,800 under
section 32, Staff assessment, offset by an equivalent amount under income section 1,
Income from staff assessment (A/C.5/56/13, para. 16).

7. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 17 of the statement submitted
by the Secretary-General that no provision was made under section 4 of the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 to cover the additional
requirements and that, notwithstanding the use in the draft resolution of the wording
“within existing resources”, these requirements cannot be absorbed within the
existing resources under section 4, Disarmament, of the proposed programme budget
for the biennium 2002-2003.

8. The Advisory Committee also notes from paragraph 21 of the statement
submitted by the Secretary-General that it is not possible at this stage to identify
activities within section 4 of the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2002-2003 that could be terminated, deferred, curtailed or modified during the
biennium. The Secretary-General is therefore proposing that, in accordance with
General Assembly resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986, the additional
requirements of $559,800 represent a charge against the contingency fund. The
Advisory Committee, recalling paragraphs 66 and 67 of its first report on the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001,1 agrees with the
procedure followed by the Secretary-General in this matter.

9. With respect to the two new posts (one P-4 and one General Service), the
Advisory Committee recalls that these posts were requested in the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003. In its first report on the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003, the Committee indicated that, on
the basis of the information provided on the programme of work, it was not
convinced of the need to establish the two posts at that stage.2 In view of the
information contained in the statement submitted by the Secretary-General, the
Advisory Committee has no objection to the establishment of the two new posts.

10. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee should
inform the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution
A/C.1/56.L.47, an additional appropriation of $559,800 would be required for
the biennium 2002-2003, as follows: section 4, Disarmament $456,100; section
27 D, Office of Central Support Services $59,900; and section 32, Staff
assessment, $43,800, to be offset by an equivalent amount under income section
1, Income from staff assessment. Under the procedures established by the
General Assembly in its resolutions 41/213 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987,
those provisions would represent a charge against the contingency fund.
