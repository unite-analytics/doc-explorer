Report of the Economic and Social Council

Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003

Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions
adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its
substantive session of 2001

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the
Secretary-General on revised estimates resulting from
resolutions and decisions of the Economic and Social
Council at its substantive session of 2001 (A/C.5/56/4).
During its consideration of the report, the Committee
met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information.

2. The net estimated additional requirements for the
biennium 2002-2003 arising from the resolutions and
decisions adopted by the Economic and Social Council
at its substantive session of 2001 amount to $1,964,000
(ibid., para. 28). The estimated additional requirements
relate to Economic and Social Council decisions
2001/218, 2001/292 and 2001/293 on the United
Nations Forum on Forests and 2001/316 on the
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, as well as to
the extract from the report of the Committee on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights at its twenty-
fifth session concerning the outcome of the review of
its methods of work (E/2001/L.8). No additional
conference-servicing resources would be required, as
provision is made in section 2, General Assembly
affairs and conference services, of the proposed

programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003,1 not
only for meetings already programmed at the time of
budget preparation, but also for meetings or extensions
of meetings that might be authorized subsequently,
provided that the pattern of meetings was consistent
with past years (see A/C.5/56/4, para. 3).

3. By its resolution 2000/35 of 18 October 2000, the
Economic and Social Council decided to establish the
United Nations Forum on Forests as a subsidiary body
of the Council. It also decided that the Forum would
hold a short organizational session, as soon as possible,
to elect officers and to decide on the location of its
secretariat, and that the Forum, at its first substantive
session in 2001, should adopt a multi-year programme
of work and decide on the venues of its future sessions.

4. The Advisory Committee notes that at the time of
the preparation of the initial budget estimates for the
biennium 2002-2003, it was not possible to assess
resource requirements for the functioning of the
secretariat of the Forum, as decisions on the multi-year
programme of work, the location of the secretariat and
the secondment of staff had yet to be taken at the
Forum’s session in 2001 (ibid., para. 5).

A/56/518

5. At its organizational session, in February 2001,
the Forum decided to locate its secretariat at
Headquarters in New York. By its decision 2001/218 of
3 May 2001, the Economic and Social Council decided
that the first and fifth substantive sessions of the Forum
would be held in New York and that two of the three
intervening sessions would be held in Geneva and one
in San José, Costa Rica. The Forum adopted a multi-
year programme of work at its first substantive session,
in June 2001, and the Council, by its decision 2001/293
of 25 July 2001, took note of the report of the Forum
on its first session.

6. The secretariat of the United Nations Forum on
Forests will form part of the Department of Economic
and Social Affairs and will report directly to the
Under-Secretary-General (ibid., para. 12). The
Advisory Committee notes that the secretariat of the
Forum currently consists of eight posts (2 D-1, 1 P-5, 2
P-4, 1 L-7 and 2 General Service (Other level)) and one
Junior Professional Officer. At present, all of the posts
are funded through extrabudgetary resources. The
Committee notes further that sufficient extrabudgetary
resources are available to enable the current staff to
continue until the end of 2001.

7. The proposal is for the secretariat of the Forum to
comprise six established posts (1 D-2, 1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1
P-3 and 2 General Service (Other level)) to be funded
from the regular budget under section 9, Economic and
social affairs, beginning in the biennium 2002-2003, at
an estimated cost of $754,300 (ibid., para. 14). The
Advisory Committee notes that the staff complement of
the secretariat is expected to be strengthened through
secondments from international and regional
organizations, institutions and instruments, as well as
voluntary contributions. Upon enquiry, the Committee
was informed that staff secondments were expected to
total five for the biennium. The estimate under section
9 also provides for $256,000 for consultants, $253,600
for expert group meetings, $232,300 for travel of staff,
$44,200 for general operating expenses, $5,400 for
supplies and materials and $27,000 to replace office
automation equipment.

8. The Advisory Committee notes that resource
requirements of $119,900 were included in the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-
2003 for the travel of representatives of member States
of the Forum that are also members of the Commission
on Sustainable Development and are participating in
the session, and that no additional requirements were

expected to arise in that regard (ibid., para. 10). The
Committee also notes that travel support is envisaged
for representatives of least developed countries not
members of the Commission to participate in the
sessions of the Forum and that such support would be
provided from available extrabudgetary resources.

9. Under section 27D, Office of Central Support
Services, estimates total $519,800, of which $238,000
relates to non-recurrent costs for office alterations and
acquisition of furniture and fixtures, and $281,800
relates to recurrent costs for rental of premises (ibid.,
para. 15). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was
informed that at present the secretariat of the Forum
was located at 2 United Nations Plaza in New York.
The Committee is of the opinion that the current
arrangements for financing accommodations for the
Forum secretariat should continue in the biennium
2002-2003; such additional requirements as may arise
should be indicated in the performance reports for
2002-2003.

10. The Advisory Committee notes that, in
accordance with Economic and Social Council decision
2001/316 of 26 July 2001, the first annual session of
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues is to be
convened at United Nations Headquarters from 6 to 17
May 2002. However, it had been assumed in the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-
2003 under section 22, Human rights, that the Forum
would meet in Geneva. Accordingly, additional
requirements of $54,800 would arise for the differential
cost of travel and subsistence of members of the Forum
($44,000) and for the travel of two staff members to
New York ($10,800) (ibid., para. 18).

11. The Advisory Committee also notes that in
paragraph 22.19 of the proposed programme budget
provision is made for the Committee on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights to hold three three-week
sessions and three one-week meetings of the pre-
sessional working group annually. However, as the
result of a review undertaken by the Committee on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on its methods of
work, the Committee decided at its twenty-fifth
session, held from 23 April to 11 May 2001, that for an
experimental period of two years it would hold only
two sessions per year. The Committee submitted an
extract (E/2001/L.8) of its report to the Economic and
Social Council concerning the issue. A statement of
programme budget implications (E/2001/L.18) was
also submitted to the Council. The resulting reduction

A/56/518

in costs under section 22 is estimated at $340,800, and
includes reductions for travel and daily subsistence
allowance for members of the Committee ($323,200)
and for daily subsistence allowance for members of the
pre-sessional working group ($17,600) (A/C.5/56/4,
para. 23).

12. The net reduction under section 22, Human
rights, of the proposed programme budget resulting
from Economic and Social Council decision 2001/316
and the extract of the report of the Committee on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights amounts to
$286,000.

13. As stated in paragraph 9 above, the Advisory
Committee is of the opinion that the requirements
under section 27D, Office of Central Support Services
($519,800) (see ibid., para. 15) should continue to be
met in the biennium 2002-2003 in the same manner as
in the current biennium. Accordingly, the Committee
recommends that the Fifth Committee take note of the
estimate of $1,444,200, on the understanding that such
appropriations as may be necessary will be requested
by the Secretary-General in the context of a
consolidated statement of programme budget
implications and revised estimates to be submitted to
the General Assembly.
