Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the International Research and Training Institute for the
Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) (see A/59/560), the report of the Secretary-
General on the financial situation of INSTRAW (A/59/433) and the statement
submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of
procedure of the General Assembly on the programme budget implications of draft
resolution A/C.3/59/L.26, concerning the future operation of INSTRAW
(A/C.5/59/16).

Overall situation and future operation of the International
Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women

2. The report of INSTRAW (A/59/560) is submitted to the General Assembly in
accordance with paragraph 7 of its resolution 57/311 of 18 June 2003, in which the
Assembly requested the Institute to report to it, one year after the appointment of a
Director, on its work programme and on the implementation of the



2
A/59/579

recommendations contained in the report of the Office of Internal Oversight
Services. The report of the Secretary-General (A/59/433) is submitted in response to
the request of the Fifth Committee (A/58/649, para. 3) that the Secretary-General
report to the Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on the overall financial situation of
the Institute.

3. The Advisory Committee met with the new Director of INSTRAW in October
2004, close to one year after her appointment on 1 December 2003. It was informed
that the new team had analysed the underlying causes of the chronic financial crises
faced by the Institute and concluded that one of the factors had been the lack of trust
of the donor community. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the post of
Director of the Institute had been vacant for a period of two years prior to the
appointment of the current incumbent. It was therefore essential to rebuild trust, and
the work programme of the Institute had been designed to achieve this goal. The
Director indicated that she was confident that trust could be restored.

4. In its strategic framework, INSTRAW has outlined its four main areas of work,
namely, research, information and communication, capacity-building and training,
and institutional development. In the area of institutional development, INSTRAW
intends to develop results-based management processes that optimize the use of
resources with transparency and accountability. Other objectives include the
development of new initiatives for resource mobilization, exploration of new
funding sources, strengthening of the working relationship with the Executive Board
and working more closely with partners and stakeholders.

5. As shown in paragraph 8 of document A/59/560, the indicators of achievement
in the area of institutional development are: funding from the regular budget for the
core operations of INSTRAW (indicator (a) (i)); and an increase in voluntary
funding by 50 per cent in 2005 (indicator (a) (ii)). In the opinion of the Advisory
Committee, these indicators of achievement raise a number of concerns. The
General Assembly, in resolution 58/244 of 23 December 2003, has stressed the
critical importance of voluntary financial contributions by Member States to the
United Nations Trust Fund for the Institute to enable it to carry out its mandate. The
statute of INSTRAW stipulates that the Institute shall be funded by voluntary
contributions by States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations,
foundations, including the United Nations Foundation, private sources and other
sources. With regard to indicator (a) (ii), given that the total extrabudgetary funds
raised as at October 2004 amounted to $176,713, an increase of 50 per cent would
still fall far short of the current core annual requirement of approximately
$1.1 million for the operation of the Institute. The Advisory Committee points out
that funding of the core activities of the Institute from the regular budget since
1999 has been an extraordinary, temporary measure, intended to allow the
Institute to become financially viable. It has been incumbent upon the Institute
to develop a realistic strategy for achieving financial autonomy. In the opinion
of the Committee, to continue to provide support on an extraordinary basis is
not sound. The Committee urges that consideration be given to a more long-
term, viable solution.

6. The proposed budget for 2005 has been presented in three main categories.
The first category of substantive strategic areas encompasses activities relating to
research, information and communication, and capacity-building and training. The
estimated resource requirement for these substantive strategic areas is $693,000,



3
A/59/579

representing 58.5 per cent of the total budget. This amount includes salaries and
other staff costs for one P-3, two P-2 and two General Service staff, as well as
contractual services, meetings, travel of staff, supplies, materials and consultancies.
The second category of the budget concerns institutional development, which
includes such activities as oversight, management, leadership and fund-raising. The
estimated resource requirements for this area are $237,000, representing 20 per cent
of the total budget, including the salary of the Director of the Institute at the D-2
level, official travel, meetings and consultancies. The resource requirements for the
third category, concerning administration and support services, amount to $209,000,
or 17.5 per cent of the total budget. This includes $138,000 for one P-2 and three
General Service staff, as well as $70,700 for general operating expenses. The
balance of the provision (4 per cent of the budget) represents the costs of
programme support incurred in the implementation of the activities funded from the
trust fund.

Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.26

7. Draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.26 on the future operation of INSTRAW, by which
the General Assembly would decide to provide its full support to the current efforts
to revitalize INSTRAW and, in that regard, to ensure that the Institute would be able
to continue functioning for a period of at least one year (from 1 January 2005 to
31 December 2005), was adopted by the Third Committee at its 37th meeting, on
4 November 2004. The Advisory Committee notes that a statement of the resulting
programme budget implications (A/C.3/59/L.36) was submitted to the Third
Committee in connection with its consideration of the draft resolution.

8. The statement of the Secretary-General on the programme budget implications
of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.26 (A/C.5/59/16) indicates that the resource
requirements for 2005 are estimated at $1,183,700. The balance of the United
Nations Trust Fund for the Institute as at 31 December 2004 is currently projected to
be approximately $91,300. Additional pledges of $12,900 to the Trust Fund were
made by four countries during the Pledging Conference for Development Activities,
held in New York on 11 November 2004. These funds would enable the Institute to
continue its operations until January 2005. It is not possible at the present stage to
determine whether the Institute would have adequate resources from voluntary
contributions to function beyond 31 January 2005. The Secretary-General estimates
that, in the event that insufficient voluntary contributions are received prior to
31 January 2005, the continued operation of INSTRAW until 31 December 2005, as
called for in the draft resolution, would give rise to additional requirements of
$1,092,400 under section 9, Economic and social affairs, of the programme budget
for the biennium 2004-2005. The Advisory Committee understands that, should
additional voluntary funds become available, they would be used to offset the
amount of the regular budgetary requirement.

9. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth
Committee inform the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution
A/C.3/59/L.26, an additional provision of up to $1,092,400 would arise under
section 9, Economic and social affairs, of the programme budget for the
biennium 2004-2005. The additional requirements would need to be considered
for appropriation in the context of the review of the consolidated statement of
programme budget implications and revised estimates, provided for in the



4
A/59/579

procedures established by the Assembly in its resolutions 41/213 of
19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987 for the use and operation of
the contingency fund, which is to be undertaken by the General Assembly
during the main part of its fifty-ninth session.1

unutilized.
