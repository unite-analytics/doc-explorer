FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS MISSION IN BOSNIA
AND HERZEGOVINA

FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS PREVENTIVE DEPLOYMENT FORCE

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the reports of the Secretary-General contained in documents
A/51/519/Add.4 and A/51/508/Add.3 on the financing of the United Nations Mission
in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) and the United Nations Preventive Deployment
Force (UNPREDEP) for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998. During its
consideration of the reports, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of
the Secretary-General who provided it with clarifications and additional
information.

I. UNITED NATIONS MISSION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

2. The report of the Secretary-General contained in document A/51/519/Add.4
includes the revised cost estimates for the maintenance of UNMIBH, including the
United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), for the period from
1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 and should be read in conjunction with documents
A/51/519/Add.1 and Add.2. It is recalled that the proposed budget for UNMIBH
was originally estimated at $172.6 million gross (see A/51/519/Add.1) and was
subsequently revised by the Secretary-General to $165.6 million gross (see
A/51/519/Add.2) to reflect the decision to discontinue the payment of hazard
duty allowance, effective 1 December 1996. Furthermore, it is recalled that as
a result of its consideration of the proposed budget for UNMIBH (A/51/519/Add.1
and 2), the Advisory Committee had recommended that the General Assembly
appropriate a total amount of $159.0 million gross for the maintenance of UNMIBH
during the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 and assess at a monthly rate
of $13.3 million gross, subject to extension of the mandate of UNMIBH beyond
21 December 1997 (A/51/872, para. 52). The Assembly has not yet considered the

reports of the Secretary-General (A/51/519/Add.1 and 2) and the related report
of the Advisory Committee (A/51/872).

3. The revised cost estimates reflect additional requirements of $12.9 million
gross resulting from Security Council resolution 1103 (1997) of 31 March 1997,
by which the Council authorized an increase in the strength of UNMIBH by 186
civilian police for the International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Brcko. The
additional requirements reflect the deployment of 11 international and 115 local
staff, as well as the acquisition of 82 vehicles, communications equipment and
supplies and services. The overall UNMIBH budget reflects, therefore, cost
estimates related to the deployment of 28 military observers, 5 military liaison
officers, 1,907 civilian police, 382 international staff and 1,083 local staff.

4. The Committee was informed, upon inquiry, that although the Security
Council, by its resolution 1107 (1997) of 16 May 1997, had authorized the
deployment of 120 additional IPTF monitors for UNMIBH to implement the human
rights, training and restructuring aspects of its mandate, the Secretariat,
owing to a lack of time, was not able to prepare the related cost estimates in
time for consideration by the General Assembly at its current session. The
Secretariat anticipates that the 120 additional IPTF monitors will be fully
deployed before 1 July 1997. The estimates will be submitted by the Secretary-
General to the Assembly at its fifty-second session.

5. The representatives of the Secretary-General submitted, upon a request of
the Advisory Committee, the following clarification on the deployment of the 186
additional police monitors referred to in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/51/519/Add.4, para. 9): the deployment, which started during the month of
April 1997, was expected to be completed before 1 July 1997. The Committee was
informed that 176 of the 186 police monitors had been deployed in Brcko as at
19 May 1997. Furthermore, the Committee was informed that the cost associated
with the deployment of the 186 police monitors during the three-month period
(April to June 1997), which was expected to be absorbed within existing
resources for the current budget period, was estimated at $1.6 million.

6. Under the revised staffing requirements (A/51/519/Add.4, paras. 11 and 12),
the deployment of 186 additional police monitors would require the support of 11
international staff (5 P-3 and 6 Field Service) as well as 115 locally recruited
language assistants. Although the Advisory Committee does not object to the
proposed staffing requirements, it recommends that the functions described in
the report be undertaken with due regard to efficiency and that the
administration review the overall need for locally recruited language assistants
with a view to reducing their number. The results of the review should be
reflected in the next report on the financing of UNMIBH.

7. With regard to the proposed acquisition of vehicles to support additional
police, international staff and locally recruited language assistants, the
Advisory Committee reiterates its previous recommendation (see A/51/872,
para. 49) that before the purchase orders are issued, the administration should
ascertain that the duration of the mandate of the Mission and the level of
operational activities indeed require the acquisition of all of the new
vehicles.

8. Taking into account the comments and observations made in the foregoing
paragraphs, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly
appropriate a total amount of $172.0 million gross (inclusive of $159.0 million
gross already recommended by the Committee) for the maintenance of the Mission
during the 12-month period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 and that it assess
at a monthly rate of $14.3 million gross, subject to extension of the mandate of
UNMIBH by the Security Council beyond 21 December 1997. Moreover, the Committee
has no objection to the proposal by the Secretary-General that the special
arrangements regarding article IV of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the
United Nations be applied to UNMIBH (see A/51/519/Add.1, para. 21).

II. UNITED NATIONS PREVENTIVE DEPLOYMENT FORCE

9. The revised cost estimates of $49.5 million gross for the maintenance of
UNPREDEP for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 result from Security
Council resolution 1105 (1997) of 9 April 1997, by which the Council decided to
suspend the reduction of the military component of UNPREDEP until the end of its
current mandate on 31 May 1997.

10. The report of the Secretary-General on the revised cost estimates
(A/51/508/Add.3) should be read in conjunction with the original budget
(A/51/508/Add.1) which provided $44.3 million for a reduced military strength of
750 troops pursuant to Security Council resolution 1082 (1996) of
27 November 1996. In that connection, the Advisory Committee reiterates its
earlier statement that, as a result of the hearings in the Committee, the
estimates were reduced by the Secretariat to $42.2 million gross to reflect more
completely the impact of the reduction in the number of troops from 1,050 to 750
(A/51/872, para. 86).

11. The Advisory Committee points out that while the revised cost estimates are
based on the assumption of the full military strength of 1,050 troops during the
entire 12-month period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998, the Secretary-General,
in his report to the Security Council on UNPREDEP, recommended that "the present
strength of the Force be maintained for a period of four months, up to
30 September 1997, with a view to starting as of 1 October 1997, taking into
account the conditions prevailing at that time, a two-month phased reduction of
the military component to the 750 troop level foreseen by the Council in
resolution 1082 (1996)" (S/1997/365, para. 27).

12. In that connection, the Advisory Committee points out that the operational
and budget requirements for the Mission should have been estimated for the
following periods within the 12-month budget period: from 1 July to
30 September 1997 when 1,050 troops will be maintained; from 1 October to
30 November 1997 when the military component of the Mission will be gradually
reduced from 1,050 to 750 troops; and from 1 December 1997 to 30 June 1998 when
750 troops will be maintained. The Committee was informed, upon request, that
the impact on the revised cost estimates of the reduction in the number of
troops from 1,050 to 750 after 30 September 1997 would be a reduction of
$3.2 million. The Committee points out, however, that the reduction is not
complete, since it has an impact on only one budget line: "military
contingents".

13. A more precise reflection in the cost estimates of the reduction in the
number of troops would be, in the view of the Committee, a proration of the
estimate of $42.2 million gross, referred to in paragraph 10 above, for the
period of eight months from 1 November 1997 to 30 June 1998, during most of
which 750 troops will be maintained. On the other hand, the requirements for
the period from 1 July to 31 October 1997, during most of which 1,050 troops
will be maintained, should be based on the proposed estimates of $49.5 million
gross.

14. Accordingly, the requirements for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1997
should be estimated at $16.5 million gross (i.e., $49.5 million prorated for
four months), and the requirements for the period from 1 November 1997 to
30 June 1998 should amount to $28.1 million gross (i.e., $42.2 million prorated
for eight months).

15. Taking into account the comments and observations made in the foregoing
paragraphs, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly
appropriate a total amount of $44.6 million gross for the maintenance of the
Mission during the 12-month period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 and that it
assess at a monthly rate of $4,125,000 gross during the period from 1 July to
31 October 1997 and thereafter (until 30 June 1998) at a monthly rate of
$3,512,500 gross, subject to extension of the mandate of UNPREDEP by the
Security Council beyond 31 May 1997. Moreover, the Committee has no objection
to the proposal by the Secretary-General that the special arrangements regarding
article IV of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations be
applied to UNPREDEP (see A/51/508/Add.1, para. 12).
