United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala

Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/56/L.42

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/56/26) in
accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly on the
budget implications of draft resolution A/55/L.42 on the United Nations Verification
Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA).

2. The Committee recalls that the Secretary-General, in his report of 14
September 2000 (A/55/389), presented a plan for gradually scaling down
MINUGUA’s presence in Guatemala until operations concluded in 2003. In his latest
report of 21 September 2001 (A/56/391), the Secretary-General indicated that a first
reduction was made in December 2000, involving a 39 per cent cut in the Mission’s
budget and the reconfiguration of its presence in the country with 46 per cent fewer
staff. The number of regional offices was reduced from eight to six and the
subregional offices from five to four. In the case of the mobile teams, only one of
the five envisaged for 2001 remained in operation, with staff reassigned into the
corresponding regional office or sub-office (see paras. 29 and 30).

3. The Advisory Committee notes, however, the indication made as to the impact
of the reduction on the Mission’s territorial deployment, which has affected its
operational capacity, forcing it to set priorities for its activities, particularly as
regards verification and institution building. The Secretary-General, in view of the
concern expressed by various sectors as to further scaling down MINUGUA’s field
presence, has proposed that the reduction for 2002 should not affect or alter the

territorial deployment planned for 2001 and that all mobile teams should be put into
operation, given the overall situation of the peace process. The regional offices will
be reinforced through redeployment of resources from headquarters and functions
assigned to the field coordinator will be reassumed by the Deputy Head of the
Mission (A/56/931, paras. 31 and 33). The Committee notes that the preamble of
draft resolution A/56/L.42 underlines the fact that the new schedule for
implementation of the substantive aspects of the peace agreements has been changed
from 2000 until the end of 2004.

4. Within this background, the estimated requirements of the Secretary-General,
which would arise under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget for the
biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/6 (Sect. 3)), for the extension of the mandate of
MINUGUA from 1 January to 31 December 2002 amount to $14,755,100
(A/C.5/56/26, para. 10 and annex I.A).

5. The Committee notes from paragraph 11 and annex V of the statement that, of
the total appropriation of $43,233,400 approved by the General Assembly for the
period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001, unaudited expenditures are
estimated at $39,871,600, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $3,361,800.

6. Paragraph 7 of the Secretary-General’s statement indicates that the MINUGUA
headquarters will be restructured around four substantive areas in 2002 (human
rights; socio-economic affairs, resettlement and integration; and public security and
armed forces) and that the number of police and military observers will remain the
same in 2002, after the reduction during 2001 from 51 to 10 and 20 to 4,
respectively.

7. The proposed staffing component, which comprises a total of 271 posts,
includes 69 international (48 Professional, 17 General Service and 4 Field Service),
139 local-level staff and 63 United Nations Volunteers. A decrease of 6 professional
and 3 field service positions is partially offset by an increase of 3 local-level
General Service staff. Vacancy factors of 5 and 3 per cent for international and local
staff, respectively, are applied in estimating staff costs. The proposed staffing by
organizational unit for 2002 is contained in annex IV of the statement.

8. The estimated operational costs for MINUGUA amount to $2,432,200 for
2002, including non-recurrent costs of $246,800, as compared to the appropriated
amount of $7,394,400 for the biennium 2000-2001. Reductions are shown under all
objects of expenditure in view of the contraction compared to the biennium 2000-
2001.

9. The Advisory Committee notes the information contained in annex III on the
use of extrabudgetary resources and the Trust Fund for the Guatemala Peace
Process. Total expenditure for the biennium 2000-2001, through the end of 2001, is
estimated at $3,727,200 for projects indicated therein. Furthermore, it is anticipated
that many of these projects will continue in 2002 and that, based on contributions
already made or under negotiation, an estimated amount of $2,342,100 will be used
in 2002.

10. The Advisory Committee notes that, in anticipation of the Mission’s eventual
withdrawal, several projects relating to the peace agenda are gradually being
transferred from the Trust Fund to the inter-agency system and that a transition
group is being set up to establish policy guidelines for the projects being transferred
to the agencies and programmes, hence making the transfer process more coherent

(see A/56/391, paras. 39-41). The Committee welcomes this development.
Moreover, the Committee was further informed that consultations, which include the
Department of Political Affairs, MINUGUA, interested States and the inter-agency
system, have been initiated with the objective of identifying and generating future
additional resources to support the consolidation of the peace-building process, as
called upon in resolution 55/177 and reiterated in draft resolution A/56/L.42. The
Advisory Committee requests the Secretary-General to report on this matter in
the context of his next presentation on MINUGA.

11. Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/56/L.42, additional
requirements of $14,755,100 would arise for 2002, which would be charged
against the provision of $93,691,600 (before recosting) for special political
missions requested in section 3, Political affairs, of the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 2002-2003.
