Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping
operations in all their aspects

Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations

The concept of strategic deployment stocks and its
implementation

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the
Secretary-General on the concept of strategic
deployment stocks and its implementation (A/56/870).
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory
Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-
General, who provided additional information.

2. As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report, in
response to the recommendation of the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations (see A/55/305-S/2000/809)
on the establishment of a rapid deployment capability
(30 days for a traditional mission and 90 days for a
complex mission), the Secretary-General proposed the
concept of a strategic reserve for peacekeeping
operations to rapidly capitalize on opportunities for
peace (see A/55/977). The rapid deployment concept
has four major components: (a) standby arrangements
for troops and police; (b) rosters of key civilian staff;
(c) material stocks at the United Nations Logistics Base
at Brindisi (UNLB); and (d) pre-mandate commitment
authority.

3. According to the Secretary-General, the material
reserve and the financial commitment authority are
crucial issues, as “existing arrangements and
procedures do not allow the Organization to meet the
rapid deployment time frame in these areas” (A/56/870,
para. 5). The Advisory Committee notes that concern
has been expressed in the Special Committee on
Peacekeeping Operations regarding the limited
response to the United Nations standby arrangements
(see A/56/863, para. 24).

4. The Advisory Committee points out that the
basic idea of strategic deployment stocks does not
appear to be an entirely new one for managing
United Nations peacekeeping operations. It should
be noted that the implementation of the concept of
start-up kits, as well as the establishment and
subsequent development of the United Nations
Logistics Base at Brindisi, has contributed greatly
to the launching of peacekeeping operations. In fact,
as indicated in paragraph 10 of document A/56/870,
the components of the current mission start-up kits
will be merged with strategic deployment stocks.

A/56/902

5. As indicated in paragraph 2 of document
A/56/870, the Special Committee on Peacekeeping
Operations urged the Secretariat to work towards the
goal of rapid deployment within a 30/90 day time
frame and endorsed the concept of a strategic reserve,
including a material reserve; the medium-sized reserve
was recommended as the most appropriate and
practical option, entailing an up-front investment of
approximately $170 million and annual recurrent costs
of some $40 million. The Committee also notes from
paragraph 7 of the report that Member States had
varying views on the assumption regarding the number
of missions, that is, whether two missions — one
complex and one traditional — or one complex mission
alone constituted an appropriate planning assumption
for strategic deployment stocks (see also para. 15
below).

6. According to the Secretariat, the strategic
deployment stocks will support the deployment of one
traditional and one complex mission with the following
profiles:

Traditional mission Complex mission

Troop strengtha 5 000 10 000

International staff 175 375

Military observers 200 500

Civilian police 100 500

Local staff 300 575

a With 50 per cent self-sustaining capability.

7. In accordance with the strategic deployment
stocks concept, the Secretariat will procure key items,
such as vehicles, communications and engineering
equipment, and accommodation and ablution units,
store them at UNLB and ensure that they are kept
current and serviceable. Other critical items and
services, such as strategic lift, fuel, rations and water,
will be procured through contractual arrangements
before the adoption of a Security Council resolution
establishing a new mission.

8. As reflected in paragraphs 24 to 27 of document
A/56/870, on the replenishment of the strategic
deployment stocks, the initial procurement of the
stocks will represent a one-time cost, proposed to be
financed from the balances of several closed missions.
Every release of equipment from strategic deployment
stocks will trigger an immediate replenishment action.

The budgets of receiving missions will provide for the
purchase of replacement commodities, as well as the
cost of shipment from the provider to UNLB. The costs
associated with the preparations for storage and
shipment of strategic deployment stocks commodities,
as part of replacement or rotation actions, will be met
through the UNLB budget. Operating and maintenance
costs, including costs for items that have to be replaced
because of expiration or obsolescence, other than
shipment and preparation costs, will also be met
through the UNLB budget. The Advisory Committee
has no objection to the replenishment policy, as its
basic principles appear to be in conformity with the
current policy approved by the General Assembly.

9. As indicated in paragraph 15 of document
A/56/870, the Secretariat will rotate certain strategic
deployment stocks — for example, vehicles and
electronic data-processing equipment — to other
missions so that the items do not become obsolete. In
this connection, the Committee cautions against the
stocking of large quantities of expensive high-tech
equipment that may become obsolete in a very short
time, such as electronic data-processing and
communications equipment. Moreover, on the basis
of information provided, the Advisory Committee
concludes that it is possible for a large number of
items to be obtained at short notice. The Committee
therefore trusts that a proper balance will be found
between items that need to be stored at UNLB and
equipment that can be obtained from either vendors
or Member States at short notice.

10. Paragraph 16 of document A/56/870 deals with
the use of contractual arrangements, namely, systems
contracts and letters of assist. As indicated therein,
“with more than 100 systems contract in place, the
Secretariat now has reduced lead time for internal
procurement processes”. The Committee was provided,
upon request, with information on lead time, which is
reproduced in the annex to the present report. The
Committee recommends that consideration be given
to contracting some services relating to receipt,
inspection and reporting in connection with
strategic deployment stocks items, with a view to
increasing the efficiency of the procurement process
for peacekeeping operations.

11. The Committee notes from paragraph 16 (b) of
document A/56/870 that the Secretariat will further
explore the use of letters of assist, which are currently

A/56/902

used for standby arrangements for strategic lift and
have proved to be very useful.

12. With regard to the possibility of using retainer
contracts, the Advisory Committee notes the statement
in paragraph 17 of document A/56/870 that “the use of
retainer contracts is not common in the United Nations
system, and there are no specific plans at this time to
use them in the context of strategic deployment
stocks”. The Committee further notes that retainer
contracts entail high costs, since a retainer fee could
range up to 30 per cent per annum of the cost of the
items.

13. As indicated in paragraph 20 of document
A/56/870, the budgetary requirements for strategic
deployment stocks include non-recurrent costs
amounting to $179.6 million. Other costs, such as those
relating to staff and maintenance, are estimated at $6
million per year and will be met through the UNLB
budget. The Committee notes that in the proposed
budget for UNLB for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30
June 2003, the cost of staff and maintenance, inter alia,
for the strategic deployment stocks is estimated at $1.9
million (see A/56/871, annex I.D, programme 7).

14. As indicated in paragraph 21 of document
A/56/870, a total of 47 additional posts (13
international and 34 local) are required for the
implementation of the strategic deployment stocks
concept, the cost of which will be reflected in the
2002/03 budget for UNLB. The Committee notes that
these 47 posts are budgeted for only six months of the
period 2002/03 since, as indicated in the Secretary-
General’s report on the proposed budget for UNLB, “it
is anticipated that most of these personnel will not be
required until the initial shipments of strategic
deployment stocks equipment arrive in the Logistics
Base in late 2002” (A/56/871, para. 9).

15. The Advisory Committee was informed that non-
recurrent budgetary requirements for strategic
deployment stocks for one complex mission would
amount to $146.2 million. The Committee is of the
view that, taking into account the magnitude of the
budgetary requirements involved, it would be
prudent at this stage to proceed to implementation
for one complex mission only. The Committee
points out that coverage for one complex mission
would also subsume provision for a traditional
mission. The Committee recommends a continuous
evaluation of the strategic deployment stocks to

ensure that the equipment is always appropriate for
the stated purpose. The Secretary-General should
ensure that there is effective inventory management
and control using available technology, including
the Field Assets Control System. The Committee
also believes that the lessons learned from
implementing the strategic deployment stocks
concept for one complex mission should be
thoroughly studied and reported to the General
Assembly through the Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

16. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon
enquiry, that the maintenance costs for strategic
deployment stocks for one complex mission at UNLB,
including staffing costs, are estimated at $1.6 million
for the budget period 2002/03. This would provide for
40 additional posts (13 international and 27 local
level). The comments and recommendations of the
Committee on staffing requirements relating to
strategic deployment stocks for one complex mission
are contained in its report on the proposed budget for
UNLB (see A/56/887/Add.10).

17. As stated in paragraph 8 above, the Secretary-
General proposes that the one-time cost of the initial
procurement of the strategic deployment stocks be
offset by using the fund balances of several closed
missions. The Committee sought clarification on
paragraph 22 of document A/56/870, which indicates
that the cost of establishing the strategic deployment
stocks will be charged to the UNLB budget on a one-
time basis. According to the clarification provided by
the Secretariat, separate accounts will be established
for recording expenditure relating to the one-time cost
of acquiring strategic deployment stocks and for
expenditure relating to UNLB, including the
maintenance of the strategic deployment stocks at
UNLB. Subject to approval by the General Assembly,
funds would be transferred from the special accounts of
several closed missions to the UNLB account to meet
costs relating to the strategic deployment stocks. Two
performance reports covering the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 will be issued, in connection with
the resources authorized for the one-time cost of
acquiring strategic deployment stocks and in
connection with the resources authorized for UNLB,
including those for the maintenance of the strategic
deployment stocks at UNLB.

18. On the issue of the financing of the strategic
deployment stocks, the Committee recalls the
approach used in the context of the establishment of
the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund (see General
Assembly resolution 47/217). In the context of the
strategic deployment stocks, the General Assembly
may wish to consider a similar procedure.

Financial commitment authority

19. Paragraphs 28 to 35 of the Secretary-General’s
report (A/56/870) deal with the issue of financial
commitment authority. The Committee notes the
proposal in paragraph 30 that commitment authority be
granted to the Secretary-General when the
establishment of a new peacekeeping mission is
anticipated. As indicated in paragraphs 28 and 35 of
the Secretary-General’s report, two major areas of
concern are procurement and planning.

20. The proposal in paragraph 29 of document
A/56/870 for an additional financial mechanism stems
from a belief that current arrangements, based on
General Assembly resolution 49/233 A, are not
applicable to the planning and procurement activities
envisaged in the report. The Advisory Committee
points out that when the Secretary-General perceives a
need to start planning for an operation that may or may
not evolve into a peacekeeping mission, he has
available a variety of mechanisms to commit funds.
These are referred to in the resolutions on unforeseen
and extraordinary expenses, adopted biennially
together with the programme budget (e.g., General
Assembly resolution 56/256), and in General Assembly
resolution 49/233 A, which provides commitment
authority for the start-up and expansion of
peacekeeping operations. Commitments pursuant to
paragraph 1 of the resolutions on unforeseen and
extraordinary expenses can be entered into either under
the Secretary-General’s own authority or, if in excess
of $8 million, with the prior concurrence of the
Advisory Committee. Commitment authority under
paragraph 3 of those resolutions or pursuant to General
Assembly resolution 49/233 A requires a prior decision
by the Security Council.

21. In this connection, the Committee notes the
Secretary-General’s proposal of a mechanism by which
he would inform the President of the Security Council
in writing of his intention to plan and prepare for a new
mission; upon receipt of a letter from the President of

the Security Council expressing concurrence with his
intention, he would initiate the steps outlined in
paragraph 35 of document A/56/870.

22. It is the opinion of the Advisory Committee
that a letter from the President of the Security
Council to the Secretary-General expressing
concurrence with the Secretary-General’s intention
to plan and prepare for a possible new mission
would constitute a decision sufficient to trigger the
implementation of either paragraph 3 of the
resolutions on unforeseen and extraordinary
expenses or General Assembly resolution 49/233 A.

23. It is the further opinion of the Advisory
Committee that the actions and activities envisaged
by the Secretary-General in paragraph 35 of
document A/56/870 fall within the scope of the
“start-up phase” referred to in General Assembly
resolution 49/233 A, section IV, paragraph 1. As
stated in paragraph 29 of the Secretary-General’s
report, such an interpretation would be consistent
with the recommendation of the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations (see A/55/305-S/2000/809,
annex III, para. 13 (c)) and with the annex to
Security Council resolution 1327 (2000).

24. Should the General Assembly endorse these
opinions of the Advisory Committee, there would be
no need to provide any additional commitment
authority or to amend section XI, paragraph 2, of
General Assembly resolution 49/233 A (see
A/56/870, para. 36 (f)). The Committee points out
that, as indicated in paragraph 31 of document
A/56/870, the cumulative total of outstanding
commitment authority would not exceed the
existing limit of $150 million; the recommendations
of the Advisory Committee would therefore not
affect the total commitment authority available to
the Secretary-General under General Assembly
resolution 49/233 A.

25. With regard to planning, the Advisory
Committee points out that there exists within the
Secretariat, particularly in the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations, a permanent capacity for
planning, which can and should be utilized without
the need for additional commitment authority. This
permanent capacity should therefore be fully
exploited before additional commitment authority is
sought or entered into.

26. Taking into account the comments and
observations above, the Advisory Committee
recommends that the General Assembly endorse the
concept of strategic deployment stocks and its
implementation for one complex mission and
approve the one-time cost of acquiring equipment
for strategic deployment stocks for one complex
mission in the amount of $146.2 million.
