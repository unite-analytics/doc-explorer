Programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003

Second performance report on the programme budget for
the biennium 2002-2003

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the second report of the Secretary-General on the performance of the
programme budget of the United Nations for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/58/558 and
Add.1). During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with
representatives of the Secretary-General who provided it with additional information
and clarification.

Financial performance for the biennium 2002-2003

2. As in the past, the report of the Secretary-General covers only financial aspects
of performance. In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls its previous
view on programme and financial performance (A/58/7, para. 18):

“The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the current practice
of reporting on programme and financial performance separately and on
separate cycles needs to be reformed to make it consistent with and
supportive of results-based budgeting. The Committee therefore
recommends that a single report be issued that would cover both
programme and financial performance for the same period. Such reports
should be available for use during the formulation and consideration of
the proposed programme budget. Accordingly, the Committee
recommends that the first trial report be produced in time for submission
to the General Assembly at the first part of its fifty-ninth session.”

3. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that a report of the
Secretary-General on programme and financial performance for the biennium 2002-
2003 that would be consistent with and supportive of results-based budgeting would
be submitted through the Committee for Programme and Coordination to the
General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.

4. The anticipated final level of expenditures and income for the biennium 2002-
2003 is based on actual expenditures for the first 20 months, projected requirements
for the last 4 months and changes in inflation and exchange rates and cost-of-living
adjustments as compared with the assumptions made in the first performance report
on the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/57/616). The Advisory
Committee recalls that, in 1997, it had recommended that the Secretariat should
attempt to base performance reporting on actual expenditures for the first 21 months
(see A/52/742, para. 10). The recommendation was subsequently reiterated in the
eighth report of the Committee to the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly
(A/54/7/Add.7, para. 4). The Advisory Committee requests that information be
provided to the Fifth Committee as to how the Secretariat intends to implement
the Committee’s recommendation.

5. The Advisory Committee notes that the anticipated final level of expenditures
and of income for the biennium represents a net increase of $49.6 million compared
with the revised appropriations and estimates of income approved by the General
Assembly in its resolutions 57/293 of 20 December 2002 and 57/311 of 18 June
2003. The projected expenditure for the biennium 2002-2003 is estimated at
$2,953.9 million gross, an increase of $62.8 million compared with the revised
appropriation of $2,891.1 million for the biennium. The projected income is
estimated at $427.6 million, an increase of $13.2 million compared with the revised
income estimates of $414.4 million for the biennium.

6. The net increase of $49.6 million reflects the combined effects of:
(a) projected additional requirements of $86.5 million due to changes in exchange
rates ($59.1 million), changes in inflation ($7.7 million), commitments entered into
in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 56/256 of 24
December 2001 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses and in respect of the
requirements for conference and support servicing of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee ($19.7 million) and (b) reduced requirements of $36.9 million due to
variations in post costs and adjustments to other objects of expenditure, based on
actual anticipated requirements ($23.7 million) and an increase in income ($13.2
million).

7. Explanations regarding the additional requirements relating to changes in
exchange rates ($59.1 million) and changes in inflation ($7.7 million) are given in
the performance report (A/58/558, paras. 6-12), as are details regarding the assumed
and actual rates of exchange (ibid., schedules 4 and 5) as well as information on
changes in exchange rates and inflation by duty station (ibid., table 4).

8. The Advisory Committee notes from the report (ibid., para. 7) that, in
estimating the effect of exchange rate changes experienced in 2003, the realized
exchange rates from January to October 2003 were used, with the October rate
applied to November and December. Moreover, the Committee notes that, consistent
with approved methodology, the average 2002 rates of exchange, which allowed for
the lowest estimates, were used in calculating the revised appropriation for 2003 for
the first performance report for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/57/616). The experience
of 2003 in respect of the Swiss franc and the euro has been a continuation of the
downward trend from the rates in effect at the end of 2002. Therefore, the projection
of an average has not been borne out by actual experience in 2003, thus resulting in
the need to significantly adjust resource requirements.

9. Detailed information on the total additional requirements of $19.7 million
relating to commitments entered into in accordance with the provisions of General
Assembly resolution 56/256 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses is contained
in the report (A/58/558, paras. 16-22) With regard to additional requirements of
$923,300 under section 7, International Court of Justice (see A/58/558, para. 16 (c)),
the Advisory Committee notes that the reported requirements of $607,400 for
pension, travel and removal expenses of retiring judges and installation grants
exceed, by $197,400, the commitments ($410,000) authorized under the terms of
paragraph 1 (b) (iv) of General Assembly resolution 56/256. The Advisory
Committee requests that the Secretariat review whether the amount of
$410,000 for such commitments currently authorized under the terms of
paragraph 1 (b) (iv) of General Assembly resolution 56/256 is adequate and, if
necessary, propose the required adjustment.

10. Information on the projected reduced requirements of $23.7 million in post
incumbency and other changes is provided in the performance report (A/58/588,
paras. 23-43, and schedules 1-3 and 6 and 8). The realized vacancy rate for the
Professional category and above was 6.2 per cent, lower than the approved budgeted
rate of 6.5 per cent, while the realized vacancy rate for the General Service category
was 3.4 per cent, higher than the approved budgeted rate of 3.1 per cent (A/58/558,
para. 26).

11. The average realized vacancy rates for the Professional category and above in
several budget sections (5, 16, 19 and 22) were above budgeted levels, reflecting,
inter alia, delays in recruitment, appointment and/or promotion to posts, separations,
and temporary placement of staff against posts at a higher level (A/58/558,
para. 28). The Advisory Committee notes with concern that, under section 16,
Economic Commission for Africa, the vacancy rates for the Professional
category continue to be exceptionally high. The Committee is of the view that
special measures should be taken on an urgent basis to address the problem of
the persistent high vacancy rates at the Economic Commission for Africa.

12. The Advisory Committee notes that, in response to its previous
recommendation, the performance report indicates the amount of unliquidated
obligations included in estimated expenditures for the biennium (A/58/558,
para. 44). The Advisory Committee welcomes the fact that unliquidated
obligations for the biennium 2002-2003 of $99.7 million are significantly lower,
compared with the amount reported as at the end of September 2001 ($161.7
million).

13. No indication is provided in the report of any savings resulting from efficiency
measures that could have been transferred to the Development Account in
accordance with established procedures. The Advisory Committee requests that
this information be provided to the Fifth Committee.

14. Schedule 3 of the performance report provides a summary of projected
expenditures for each budget section by object of expenditure and main determining
factor, including travel estimates. The Advisory Committee notes, however, that
the report does not separately indicate variances in travel expenses relating to
travel of representatives and travel of staff, although the Committee had
recommended that this information should be included in future performance
reports (see A/56/694, para. 13). The Committee requests that the Secretariat
provide this information to the Fifth Committee.

Review of the United Nations Postal Administration

15. The General Assembly, in section VI of its resolution 57/292 of 20 December
2002, noted with deep concern the serious and continuing deterioration in the
business of the United Nations Postal Administration and requested the Secretary-
General to ensure, as a matter of priority, that the downward trend in the business of
the Postal Administration be reversed, considering all possible courses of action for
the future conduct of its business, and to report thereon to the General Assembly in
the context of the second performance report for the biennium 2002-2003.
Information on review of the Postal Administration is contained in the addendum to
the Secretary-General’s second performance report (A/58/558/Add.1).

16. According to the Secretary-General, a comprehensive review of the operations
of the Postal Administration has been undertaken, with the involvement of an
outside consultant specializing in philatelic market operations, and a number of
recommendations stemming from the review have been or are currently in the
process of being implemented. The report contains information on problem analysis
measures taken to improve operations (A/58/558/Add.1, paras. 8-21).

17. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 23 of the report that initiatives
taken to reverse the downward trend in the revenues of the Postal Administration
have already shown encouraging results: the operations have been streamlined; the
organizational structure is now simpler and more effective; and it is estimated that
the negative financial trends of 2002 will be turned around and the Postal
Administration will achieve a modest surplus of $189,000 in the current biennium.

18. The Advisory Committee further notes there is a proposal in the report
(A/58/558/Add.1, para. 24) to change the present arrangements whereby net surplus
from the revenue-producing activities under Income section 3, Services to the
public, is used to help offset the expenditure part of the regular budget. According to
the proposal, the surplus would be credited to a reserve fund to be established
effective as from the biennium 2004-2005. The proposal, if accepted, would require
that the General Assembly grant an exception to financial rule 103.7. The Advisory
Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the size of such a reserve fund has not
yet been accurately determined.

19. According to the Secretariat, the surplus accumulated in the reserve fund
would be used to meet contingent liability of the Postal Administration. The issue of
the contingent liability of the Postal Administration is explained in the Secretary-
General’s report (A/58/558/Add.1, paras. 10 and 11). The Secretariat indicates that
while, in the past, only a small percentage of United Nations stamps sold were
actually used for postage by customers, the percentage of postage charges paid to
the United States Postal Service of the gross stamp sale revenue increased from 6
per cent in 1980 to 18 per cent in 2002; more importantly, the United Nations is now
incurring expenditures for products sold in past periods for which the accounts have
been closed. The Advisory Committee sought information on the estimated amount
of contingent liability and was informed that no accurate estimates were available at
this stage. However, the estimates would be provided to the Advisory Committee
and to the Fifth Committee as soon as they become available.

20. The Advisory Committee was informed that negotiations are under way
between the United Nations Postal Administration and the postal authorities of the
United States of America, Switzerland and Austria, with a view to obtaining more

A/58/604

favourable agreements that may also positively impact on contingent liabilities of
the Postal Administration. The Advisory Committee encourages the
administration to take further efforts to achieve success in these negotiations.

21. In the meantime, the Advisory Committee recommends that the current
arrangements for accounting for the sale of United Nations stamps be
continued.

Status of work in the implementation of measures to strengthen the security and
safety of United Nations premises

22. Information on the status of work in the implementation of measures to
strengthen the security and safety of United Nations premises summarizes the work
undertaken and/or planned by the Secretariat during 2003. Earlier, information on
progress in the implementation of those measures during 2002 and the status of
expenditures as of 31 October 2002 was included in the first performance report on
the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/57/616).

23. The Advisory Committee was informed that the Secretary-General is currently
considering what additional measures need to be taken to improve the security and
safety of United Nations premises and its personnel. According to the Secretariat, a
report on such measures, with the indication of all additional requirements for the
biennium 2004-2005, will be submitted to the resumed session of the Fifth
Committee in the spring of 2004. The Committee intends to present its comments
and recommendations on the issue of security and safety of United Nations premises
and personnel in the context of its review of the forthcoming report of the Secretary-
General.
