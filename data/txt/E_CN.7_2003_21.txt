  Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions 
 
 

 I. Introduction 
 
 

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has 
considered the report of the Executive Director on the consolidated budget for the 
biennium 2004-2005 for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(E/CN.7/2003/20). The report presents the separate budgets for drug and crime 
programmes, including a comprehensive view of all planned activities and the 
resources required for their implementation. During its consideration of the report, 
the Advisory Committee exchanged views with the Executive Director and other 
senior officials of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme 
(UNDCP), who provided additional information. 

2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime implements the Organization’s 
drug and crime programmes in an integrated manner. These comprise UNDCP, 
established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 45/179 of 21 December 1990, 
and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, established by the 
Assembly in its resolution 46/152 of 18 December 1991. Annex II to the report of 
the Executive Director, contained in the addendum (E/CN.7/2003/20/Add.1), shows 
the organizational chart of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and 
describes the functions of its major organizational units. The Committee requests 
that in the future, at the time of its examination of the estimates, it should be 
provided with an organizational chart that includes the number of posts in each unit 
at headquarters.

 A. Budget format and presentation 
 
 

3. The consolidated budget of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
includes normative, technical cooperation and core programme activities and a 
support budget necessary to enable the Office to implement the programme. The 
programme budget is funded mainly from special-purpose (SP) funds (earmarked 
voluntary funds) and the support budget from general-purpose (GP) voluntary 
contributions. SP funds are earmarked by region or by theme (“soft” earmarking) or 
are earmarked to a specific project or activity within a project (“hard” earmarking). 
GP funds also finance priority areas not attracting special-purpose (earmarked) 
contributions, thus providing programme flexibility (E/CN.7/2003/20, paras. 1, 109 
and 115). The regular budget of the United Nations funds normative activities, some 
core programme activities and a few support functions (see A/58/6, (Sects. 16 
and 17)). For the biennium 2004-2005, under a low-income projection for the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (base-income scenario) (see para. 9 
below), SP funds would account for 66 per cent of the income projection for the 
Office, GP funds for 19 per cent and the contribution from the United Nations 
regular budget 15 per cent (see E/CN.7/2003/20, figure IV). 

4.  The budget document includes a retrospective performance of the current 
biennium for both the drug and crime programmes of the Office (part two of the 
budget document), a programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 for both the 
drug and crime programmes (part three), proposals submitted for approval by the 
Commission on Narcotic Drugs for the budget of the Fund of the United Nations 
International Drug Control Programme for the biennium 2004-2005 under the drug 
programme (part four) (see also E/CN.7/2003/20/Add.1, annex I) and a financial 
forecast and programme for the biennium 2004-2005 for the Crime Prevention and 
Criminal Justice Fund under the crime programme of the Office (part five). The 
Advisory Committee welcomes the executive summary and consolidated income 
presentation included in part one of the budget document. 

5.  The Advisory Committee commends the Executive Director for the efforts to 
present a consolidated view of the drug and crime programmes of the Office. The 
Committee notes that the consolidated budget document is a step in the reform 
process of the Office. The Committee welcomes the measures taken by the 
Executive Director to enhance performance and results through better priority 
setting, planning tools and field delivery. The Committee trusts that the management 
reforms implemented by the Executive Director in the biennium 2002-2003 (see 
E/CN.7/2003/20, paras. 6-8) would have considerable impact on the delivery of the 
programme in the biennium 2004-2005. The Committee expects that the results of 
the reform process will be reflected in further improvements in governance, funding, 
operational management, communications and staff management relations and that 
the programme will reach some stability. 

6. The programme of work for the biennium 2004-2005 (part three of the budget 
report) follows a result-based budgeting format and includes an integrated 
presentation of the drug and crime programmes funded from the resources of the 
Fund of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the Crime 
Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund and the regular budget. The Advisory 
Committee notes that an attempt has been made to present main objectives, 
expected results and verifiable achievement indicators for nine thematic sectors. The

 E/CN.7/2003/21

presentation of objectives, results and indicators of achievement could be improved. 
There is a need to follow a more rigorous result-based framework in consonance 
with the presentation of the same programmes under the regular budget of the 
United Nations. For example, in the thematic programme on human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), 
objectives should be specific, clearly identified and not confused with activities or 
output of the programme. The description of the same programmes in the 
consolidated budget of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and in the 
regular budget (sections 17, International drug control, and 16, Crime prevention 
and criminal justice) should be consistent (see, for example, A/58/6 (Sect. 17), 
table 17.15). The Committee further recommends that efforts be made to indicate to 
what extent expected results would contribute to the attainment of the stated 
objectives, within clearly defined time frames. Indicators of achievement should be 
verifiable, concrete and quantifiable; vague, generic descriptions render the 
measurement of performance difficult. The Committee recommends that part three 
of the document on result-based budgeting be streamlined so as to have a more 
concise and focused presentation in the future. 

7.  The Committee is aware that the implementation of result-based budgeting is 
in its early stages at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as in other 
organizations of the United Nations system, and that refinements will be introduced 
as further experience is gained in performance measurement and application of 
result-based management methodologies. The Committee has commented 
extensively on the matter.1 In that connection, the Committee recommends that the 
Office maintain better coordination with the Budget Division of the Secretariat to 
present a coherent result-based framework for both the drug and crime programmes 
in the documentation submitted to the General Assembly and to the Commission on 
Narcotic Drugs; the Committee also urges the Office to maintain close collaboration 
with other United Nations entities that have introduced result-based management 
systems (see, for example, the report of the Administrator of the United Nations 
Development Programme on the budget estimates of the Programme for the 
biennium 2004-2005),2 with the objective of using common terminology. In the 
future, result-based budgeting terminology used by the Office should be included in 
the definitions annexed to the report.  
 
 

  Consolidated income projections 
 
 

8.  Figure III in the report of the Executive Director (E/CN.7/2003/20) shows 
total voluntary income projections by source (i.e. traditional donors, cost-sharing, 
public donation and private sector) for the biennium 2004-2005 for the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as compared with the biennium 2002-2003. For 
the biennium 2004-2005, a base- and a high-income scenario are presented for both 
the drug programme and the crime programme. The proposed budget for the 
biennium 2004-2005 is predicated on a projected total income from voluntary 
sources of $155.8 million (base-income scenario), comprising $141.8 million for the 
drugs programme and $14.0 million for the crime programme. The total income 
projections for the biennium 2004-2005 from voluntary sources of $155.8 million 
show a decrease of about 1 per cent as compared with the income for the biennium 
2002-2003 of $156.9 million.

E/CN.7/2003/21  

9.  Figure IV of the report shows total income resources projected for the 
biennium 2004-2005 for the Office, as compared with the biennium 2002-2003. The 
projections include a breakdown of voluntary contributions between GP and SP 
funds and the amount to be contributed by the regular budget of the United Nations. 
For the biennium 2004-2005, under the base-income scenario, total income would 
amount to $183.7 million for both the drug programme ($160.3 million) and the 
crime programme ($23.4 million).  

10.  The Advisory Committee notes that GP funds of $35.2 million for the drug and 
crime programmes of the Office are expected to remain at about the same level for 
the biennium 2004-2005 ($33.0 million for the drugs programme and $2.2 million 
for the crime programme), as compared with $35.3 million for the biennium 2002-
2003 ($33.6 million for the drugs programme and $1.7 million for the crime 
programme) (E/CN.7/2003/20, para. 21 and figure IV). The Committee notes from 
paragraph 271 of the report that for the biennium 2002-2003 some traditional 
donors who had stopped making GP contributions in the past have resumed 
contributing, while some others are contributing more GP funds. The Committee 
welcomes that trend. 

11. The Advisory Committee was informed about continuous efforts and 
innovative approaches in fund-raising to secure contributions from traditional 
government donors, to broaden the base of government funding, to expand cost-
sharing arrangements involving financial institutions and bilateral loan programmes 
and to identify private sector and United Nations inter-agency funding sources. The 
Committee welcomes and encourages the efforts of the Executive Director, 
including increasing cooperation with the private sector. The Committee recalls the 
view it expressed in paragraph 6 of its report of 26 February 2003 (E/CN.7/2003/16) 
and stresses the need for complete transparency in such arrangements with the 
private sector so that stakeholders can monitor the allocation and use of all such 
funds. The Committee would welcome the further development of best practices 
that might be widely drawn upon as guidance in that area. 
 
 

 II. Fund of the United Nations International Drug Control 
Programme 
 
 

 A. Programme and final support budgets for the biennium 2002-2003 
 
 

12.  The budget performance and final support budget for the Fund of the United 
Nations International Drug Control Programme for the biennium 2002-2003 is 
provided in part two of the report of the Executive Director. As shown in table 10 of 
the consolidated budget document and annex VI of the addendum 
(E/CN.7/2003/20/Add.1), the final budget for the biennium 2002-2003 amounts to 
$144.2 million, comprising a programme budget of $106.3 million, a final support 
budget of $35.4 million and agency support costs of $2.5 million.  

13.  The Advisory Committee notes that the final support budget of $35.4 million 
increases by $3.0 million (or 9.2 per cent), as compared with the revised support 
budget for the biennium 2002-2003 of $32.4 million. Volume and cost changes are 
discussed in paragraphs 117-120 of the budget document. The Committee notes that 
13 posts, budgeted at $1.8 million, have been transferred from the support budget to 



 
 5 
 

 E/CN.7/2003/21

the core programme budget (para. 119). The core programme budget for the 
biennium 2002-2003 amounts to $10.2 million (see paras. 122 and 123). The 
Committee requests that, in the future, reasons for the transfer of posts from the 
support budget to the core programme budget be adequately explained in the budget 
report. 
 
 

 B. Programme and support budgets for the biennium 2004-2005 
 
 

14.  A summary of resource requirements for the Fund of the United Nations 
International Drug Control Programme for the biennium 2004-2005 is shown in 
table 38 of the report and annex VI to the addendum. For the biennium 2004-2005, 
the total budget amounts to $187.4 million, comprising a programme budget of 
$146.9 million, a support budget of $35.9 million and agency support costs of $4.6 
million. Total projected resources amount to $196.0 million (a projected income of 
$141.8 million and an opening balance of $54.2 million). 

15.  The Advisory Committee notes that, in terms of resource utilization, it is 
planned to maintain a programme to support ratio of 78:22 for the biennium 
2004-2005 (E/CN.7/2003/20, para. 260). Upon request, the Committee was 
informed that, in either the high- or low-income scenario, the support budget is 
expected to remain stable, with adjustments possibly to projects funded from GP 
funds. The Committee recalls its observations in paragraphs 11 and 19 of its report 
of 5 November 2001 (E/CN.7/2001/18). Although the Committee welcomes the 
restructuring of headquarters and the re-profiling of the field office network 
discussed in paragraph 7 of the report of the Executive Director, it remains 
concerned at the high proportion of resources planned for the support budget for the 
biennium 2004-2005. 
 
 

 C. Information technology 
 
 

16.  Information technology requirements are discussed in paragraphs 293-301 of 
the report of the Executive Director. Table 42 of the budget document shows that a 
provision of $1,375,400 is requested for the UNDCP Programme and Financial 
Management Information System (ProFi) for the biennium 2004-2005. Annex XII 
(see E/CN.7/2003/20/Add.1) summarizes ProFi accomplishments in the biennium 
2002-2003. The Advisory Committee notes that during the biennium 2004-2005, 
high priority will be given to the development of phase 2 of ProFi. The Committee 
recalls that phase 2 (the programme and project management component) was 
supposed to start in early 2002, subject to funding (see E/CN.7/2001/18, para. 26). 
The Committee was provided with the terms of reference for a consultant who 
would be hired to assist with the development of phase 2. 

17.  The Committee notes that “with a view to providing ProFi with predictable 
and appropriate funding, it is proposed to charge each project allocation with 
1 per cent for the purpose of ensuring permanent updates, maintenance and support 
and to equally divide the charge for maintaining ProFi to both donor and receiving 
countries” (E/CN.7/2003/20, para. 300). The Committee does not support the 
proposed mode of funding phase 2 of ProFi and recommends that the full cost of 
ProFi be funded from the support budget.
