Standards of accommodation for air travel

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on standards of accommodation for
air travel (A/59/523). During its consideration of this report, the Committee met
with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.

2. The report of the Secretary-General was submitted in accordance with General
Assembly resolutions 42/214 of 21 December 1987 and 45/248 A of 21 December
1990 and decisions 44/442 of 21 December 1989, 46/450 of 20 December 1991 and
57/589 of 18 June 2003, in which the Secretary-General was requested to submit a
report to the General Assembly on a biennial basis. The report provides information
on exceptions to the standards of accommodation for air travel authorized for the
period ended 30 June 2004.

3. The standards of air travel at the United Nations are governed by a series of
General Assembly resolutions and decisions, including decision 40/555 of
18 December 1985, resolution 42/214, decision 44/442, resolution 45/248 A,
decision 46/450, resolution 53/214 of 18 December 1998 and decision 57/589.
Exceptions to those standards authorized by the Secretary-General are indicated in
paragraph 6 of A/59/523.

4. The Advisory Committee notes that the number of exceptions to the
standards of accommodation for air travel and the additional costs incurred for
the reporting period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2004 increased significantly
from those reported for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2002. For the
period 2002/04, 236 exceptions representing an additional cost of $442,482 were
reported, as compared with 161 exceptions at an additional cost of $320,791 for
the period 2000/02 (see A/59/523, tables 1 and 2).

5. With reference to exceptions authorized for first class and business class
listed in annexes I to VII of A/59/523, the Advisory Committee reiterates its
request that in future the additional information provided to the Committee



2
A/59/573

include the date of booking, travel dates, itinerary and number of travel days as
well as the nature of the event being attended (see A/56/7, paras. 127-129). The
Committee points out that in strict conformity with existing procedures, travel
should always be by the most direct and economical route; itineraries should
not be manipulated to provide for a higher standard of accommodation than
would otherwise be allowed.

6. The Advisory Committee notes that exceptions to the normal standards of air
travel include exceptions authorized by the Secretary-General because the traveller
is considered an eminent person. As indicated in paragraph 6 (c) of A/59/523, an
eminent person for the purpose of the exception is a traveller, “such as a former
head of State, or a prominent international figure in the political, humanitarian or
cultural arenas”. The Committee notes that this definition is fairly broad and that the
list of eminent persons travelling first class continued to increase in the reporting
period (see A/59/523, annex III).

7. The Advisory Committee notes that exceptions authorized for prominent
persons donating their services free of charge to the Organization continued to
increase in the reporting period. In the period 2002/04, 48 trips were authorized at
an additional cost of $96,007, as compared with 16 trips at an additional cost of
$53,618 in the period 2000/02 (see A/59/523, tables 1 and 2, and annex IV).

8. The Advisory Committee was provided with information on exceptions
authorized for first-class travel by personal aides and security officers for the
reporting period, including itineraries.

9. The Advisory Committee has noted what appears to be a blurring of
categories; sometimes the same person is listed under different categories for
different trips. Moreover, there appears to be an increasingly broad application of
the various exceptions to the normal standards of air travel. The Committee is of
the opinion that definitions need to be tightened and that they should be
consistently applied.

10. Notwithstanding what has been stated above with regard to the need to
tighten existing definitions and procedures for the application of travel
standards, the Committee is of the opinion that the time has come for a
reconsideration of the whole question of first-class travel. The Committee
observes that in recent years, many airlines have significantly cut back, if not
entirely eliminated, first-class sections on aircraft. Instead, several varieties of
enhanced business-class travel have been developed, and it appears that
differences in the level of accommodation between these classes and first class
are minimal. Taking these developments into account, the General Assembly
may wish to give further guidance on the future use of first-class travel with a
view to its use in only the most exceptional circumstances.
