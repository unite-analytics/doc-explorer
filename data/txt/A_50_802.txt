Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United
Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) (A/50/735), the United Nations
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) (A/50/655 and Corr.1),
the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) (A/50/749), the
United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) (A/50/731) and the United
Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) (A/50/722 and Corr.1). These
documents contain the performance reports of the various peace-keeping
operations mentioned above. During its consideration of the reports, the
Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who
provided additional information and clarification.

2. In view of the time constraints facing both the Advisory Committee and the
Fifth Committee at this stage, and the need to ensure that documentation be
kept to a minimum, the Advisory Committee is presenting its separate reports on

95-38530 (E) 061295 /...



A/50/802

each of the peace-keeping operations referred to above under the cover of one
document. This in no way implies the amalgamation or combination of the
treatment of any aspect of the financing of these operations. Reports of the
Advisory Committee on the performance of a number of other peace-keeping
operations, which have not yet been taken up by the Committee, will be issued
shortly. In its separate consideration of each of the reports submitted by the
Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee noted a number of emerging trends and
budgeting practices that are common to most, if not all, the peace-keeping
operations listed above.

General observations

3. The General Assembly, in its resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994, urged
the Secretary-General to submit "in the context of the consideration of peace-
keeping budget estimates, the related performance report for each peace-keeping
operation for the previous financial period". By the same resolution, the
General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the reports are
based on actual expenditure rather than projected data. The Advisory Committee
notes that, while the performance report of UNMOT was "submitted in accordance
with that request" (A/50/749 and Corr.1, para. 1), annex I to the report refers
to estimated expenditure. Annex I to the MINURSO performance report (A/50/655
and Corr.1) also refers to estimated expenditure.

4. In considering the performance reports, the Advisory Committee has observed
that expenditures relating to internal audit have been included in the travel
component of some of the operations. The Committee believes that this trend is
misleading, especially since in the original budgets for the peace-keeping
operations, separate costs for internal audit have not been identified. The
Committee recommends that in future all costs relating to internal audit be
properly identified in the budget estimates as well as in the performance
reports.

5. The Advisory Committee notes that in the main, efforts have been made to
present complete and well-prepared performance reports which have taken into
account the previous comments of the Committee. The Committee, in particular
commends the tabular and graphic presentation of information pertaining to
various aspects of the budget. However, the Committee found the quality of the
performance reports to be inconsistent; the Secretary-General should address
this issue to ensure that the information contained in all performance reports
is of a high quality. Moreover, the Committee recalls its comments that it
served little purpose for a performance report to include a statement to the
effect that savings for one sub-item were partially offset by increased
expenditure under another sub-item if the changes were not substantiated and
justified. The Committee recommends that information on performance results
contained in performance reports should always be stated by comparison with the
budgeted amounts.

6. The Advisory Committee believes that there is still a need to better define
the relationship between the budget and the performance report. For example,
savings and overexpenditures shown against specific items in the performance
reports relate to allotments made by the Secretariat and not to amounts
appropriated by the General Assembly. Therefore, although there are

/...



A/50/802
English
Page 3

overexpenditures shown against certain items, in actual fact there are overall
savings (unencumbered balances) against appropriations. This aspect should be
explained clearly in the performance reports. In this connection, the Advisory
Committee notes that the General Assembly does not appropriate funds by line
item. Rather, the Secretary-General has the flexibility to manage the
appropriation as a unit. However, the experience of the Committee in reviewing
a number of performance reports indicated that there is a need for the
Secretary-General to exercise this flexibility in a manner that would not call
into question the broad assumptions and the justification previously presented
by him regarding the estimates that the General Assembly has approved.

7. The Advisory Committee was informed that overall forecasts of fluctuations
in currency exchange and inflation rates are not taken into consideration when
peace-keeping budgets are being prepared. However, where specific increases in
unit rates are anticipated, these are stated in the cost estimates. Therefore,
performance reports show gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in currency
exchange and inflation rates.

8. The Advisory Committee has noted a tendency in some instances to charge all
or part of the costs of the Secretary-General’s travel to a peace-keeping
mission to the budget of that peace-keeping mission. For reasons of
transparency, the Committee believes that care should be taken to ensure that
all costs of the Secretary-General’s travel, regardless of the source of
funding, can be readily ascertained.

9. The Advisory Committee has also noted that in quite a few of the peace-
keeping missions there is a tendency to exceed the budgeted allocation of air
operations owing to unplanned use of aircraft. The Committee recommends that
particular attention be paid to this issue, with a view to restricting the use
of aircraft to essential operational needs. Furthermore, the Committee
recommends that the most cost-effective contractual arrangement be made with
aircraft suppliers.

10. With regard to public information activities, the Advisory Committee
recalls that in its report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session
(A/49/664), the Committee agreed with the Secretary-General’s view that public
information activities specific to a particular peace-keeping operation should
be financed from the individual peace-keeping budget accounts. However, the
Committee also believed that the mandate for such public information activities
as could be financed from the budgets of peace-keeping operations should be
specifically spelled out in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.

11. The Advisory Committee notes that for various reasons the estimated
resources for public information activities, budgeted for in a number of
performance reports it has examined, could not be utilized. Such a situation
not only calls into question the operational requirements of a particular public
information programme but also the United Nations ability to deliver public
information activities relative to peace-keeping operations. The Advisory
Committee recommends that special attention be paid to these issues in the
preparation of future budget estimates. In this connection, the Committee
recalls the comments it made in its first report on the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 1996-1997, 1/ in which it recommended a study of the

/...



A/50/802
English
Page 4

question in all its aspects and the submission of a policy proposal, including
financial implications, to the General Assembly.

12. In its recent consideration of some of the performance reports of peace-
keeping operations other than those covered in the present report, the Advisory
Committee has noted expenditures allotted for producing the Secretary-General’s
Blue Book on peace-keeping operations, for which no provision had been made in
the cost estimates. The Committee requested additional explanation but no such
information was given. The Committee recommends that in future such expenditure
should not be presented ex post facto in the performance reports; it should be
included and justified in the budget estimates.

13. The Advisory Committee believes that the successful reintegration of
Headquarters personnel on mission assignment to regular activities, in
accordance with existing regulations, rules and procedures, is important. The
Committee intends to monitor this matter closely and, to this end, requests
information on this issue during the course of 1996 and each time a report on
mission wrap-up is presented.

United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador

14. The report of the Secretary-General (A/50/735) contains the financial
performance of the mission for the periods from 1 December 1994 to 30 April 1995
and from 1 to 31 May 1995, for which the General Assembly had approved an amount
totalling $4,747,500 gross for the operation of the mission as well as its
liquidation. The performance report indicates an overexpenditure of $842,300
during the period under consideration. The letter dated 20 November 1995 from
the Chairman of the Advisory Committee to the Secretary-General is attached as
an annex to the present report.

United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara

15. The report of the Secretary-General (A/50/655 and Corr.1) contains the
financial performance of MINURSO from 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995. As
indicated in paragraph 3 of the report, resources made available to the
operation for the period 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995 totalled $39,711,500
gross ($36,582,500 net), while expenditure for the period amounted to
$37,092,900 gross ($34,364,700 net), resulting in an unencumbered balance of
$2,618,600 gross ($2,217,800 net). As indicated in the report, the unencumbered
balance resulted mainly from delays in the work of the Identification Commission
and, as a result, the lower number of international and local staff in the
mission area, which led to savings under premises, equipment and supplies and
services. These savings were partially offset by additional requirements in the
flying hours for the aircraft, reasons for which have been outlined in
paragraph 58 of the report, the overlap time during the increased number of
rotations of military observers and for spare parts and transport operations and
commercial freight and cartage.

16. The Advisory Committee notes that requirements for travel for military
observers amounted to an additional $182,100 over the initial cost estimate of
$657,200. For reasons indicated in paragraph 2 of annex II to the report, an
additional 57 unforeseen rotation trips of military observers accounts for the

/...



A/50/802
English
Page 5

additional expenditure. While the Committee appreciates the conditions that may
have given rise to this additional expenditure, based on experience gained in
this mission area and elsewhere, the Committee believes that these travel
requirements should have been better managed.

17. The Committee finds little justification for the items of overexpenditure
listed in paragraph 29 of annex II to the report and notes that extraneous items
such as travel related to training and auditing have been added to the costs.
The Committee believes that not only should there be greater control over
unbudgeted and unforeseen expenditure for travel and other items but that the
existing machinery for correcting shortfalls should be used. With regard to the
expenditure shown in paragraph 29 (m) for two security staff accompanying the
Secretary-General to the mission area, the Committee understands that the
Secretary-General’s overall travel expenditure was pro-rated and a share of the
costs was charged to MINURSO. The views of the Committee on the costs of travel
by the Secretary-General are stated in paragraph 8 above.

18. The Advisory Committee agrees with the proposal in paragraph 4 of the
Secretary-General’s report to credit Member States the unencumbered balance of
$2,618,600 gross ($2,217,800 net) with respect to the period from 1 October 1994
to 30 June 1995 against their future assessment relating to any mandate period
approved by the Security Council.

United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan

19. The report of the Secretary-General (A/50/749 and Corr.1) contains the
performance report of UNMOT for the mandate period from 16 December 1994 to
16 June 1995.

20. The General Assembly, by its resolution 49/240 of 31 March 1995,
inter alia, appropriated for the operation of UNMOT: (a) $3,251,200 gross
($3,123,600 net) for the period from 16 December 1994 to 26 April 1995 and
(b) $10,044,200 gross ($9,547,000 net) for the period from 27 April 1995 to
30 June 1996, to be assessed at the rate of $717,400 gross ($681,900 net)
per month, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mission
beyond 26 April 1995.

21. As indicated to the Advisory Committee, for the period from
16 December 1994 to 16 June 1995, resources totalling $3,968,600 gross
($3,805,500 net) were provided for the operation of UNMOT, equivalent to the
amounts authorized by the General Assembly from 16 December 1994 to 27 May 1995
as follows:

(a) $3,251,200 gross ($3,123,600 net) for the period from 16 December 1994
to 26 April 1995;

(b) $717,400 gross ($681,900 net) for one month from 27 April to
26 May 1995. This monthly amount was derived from pro-rating the appropriation
of $10,044,200 gross ($9,547,000 net) for the 14-month period from 27 April 1995
to 30 June 1996.

22. Of the amount of $3,968,600 gross ($3,805,500 net), the estimated
expenditure totalled $3,590,000 gross ($3,431,700 net), resulting in an
unencumbered balance of $378,600 gross ($373,800 net).

23. As indicated in paragraph 3 of the Secretary-General’s report (A/50/749 and
Corr.1), the unencumbered balance resulted mainly from lower air fares and a
lower number of rotation trips undertaken by military observers; the use of
diesel fuel instead of gasoline; the utilization of United Nations Protection
Force (UNPROFOR) aircraft rather than the chartering of aircraft, for which no
reimbursement was provided to UNPROFOR. On inquiry, the Advisory Committee was
informed that the aircraft that had already been hired or chartered for UNPROFOR
were not able to operate in the UNPROFOR mission area and therefore their
services were diverted to UNMOT as needed. The Committee welcomes such an
initiative, which has resulted in overall savings for the Organization.

24. As indicated in paragraphs 8 to 10 of the report under consideration, the
Advisory Committee notes that in his report to the Security Council on the
situation in Tajikistan (S/1995/799), the Secretary-General indicated that the
Afghan officials had agreed that UNMOT could open a small liaison post in
Taloqan (northern Afghanistan) with the exclusive task of dealing with the Tajik
problem. Accordingly, the Secretary-General proposed that the liaison post be
established once discussions with the Afghan authorities had been concluded. In
the same report, the Secretary-General had indicated that as a result of the
establishment of the posts in Vanj and Taloqan, it would be the intention of the
Secretary-General to seek budgetary authority for a small increase in UNMOT
staff of five military observers and three civil affairs officers. In his
statement of 6 November 1995 (S/PRST/1995/54), the President of the Security
Council agreed with the Secretary-General’s proposals.

25. On inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed by representatives of the
Secretary-General that the detailed cost estimates for the increase of UNMOT
staff of five military observers and three civil affairs officers was currently
in preparation. It was anticipated that the estimates would be finalized by
early December 1995, at which time it would be determined whether the additional
requirements resulting from the strengthening of UNMOT could be met from
existing resources, including the unencumbered balance of $378,600 gross
($373,800 net).

26. As indicated in paragraph 12 of the report, the proposed action to be taken
by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session is a decision to retain the
unencumbered balance of $378,600 gross ($373,800 net) in the UNMOT special
account. The Advisory Committee recalls that, with regard to the treatment of
an unencumbered balance, the current practice is that it is returned to Member
States unless the General Assembly decides otherwise.

United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia

27. The report of the Secretary-General (A/50/731) contains information on the
financial performance of UNOMIG for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995.
The report also outlines the actions that would be required to be taken by the
General Assembly at its fiftieth session in connection with the financing of
UNOMIG.

/...



A/50/802

28. As indicated in paragraph 3 of the Secretary-General’s report and in
annex I, total expenditure for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 amounts
to $4,913,600 gross ($4,609,500 net) compared to an appropriation of $6,880,136
gross ($6,468,100 net). The Advisory Committee notes from annexes I and II to
the report that the unencumbered balance of $1,966,500 gross ($1,858,600 net)
for the period resulted mainly from savings for air operations ($1,413,700),
military personnel costs ($158,300), civilian personnel costs ($323,400),
transport operations ($36,600), supplies and services ($22,800) and public
information programmes ($83,600). These were partially offset by additional
requirements under communication equipment ($194,700).

29. With regard to the savings under air operations, the Advisory Committee was
informed that these were due to the fact that the contractor did not have
permission to land in all countries of the mission area. In view of the need
for the air operation by the mission, the Committee regrets that this problem
was not rectified promptly. In this connection, it is the view of the Committee
that, in order to minimize similar problems in the future, before a contract is
awarded, the Secretariat should ensure that a contractor fulfils all the
conditions of the contract.

30. The Secretary-General is requesting the General Assembly to decide to
retain the unencumbered balance of $1,966,500 gross ($1,858,600 net) for the
period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 in the light of the outstanding assessed
contributions. In this connection, the Advisory Committee was informed that, as
at 15 November 1995, outstanding assessed contributions amount to $2.4 million
out of total net assessments of $26 million. The Committee recalls that with
regard to the treatment of the unencumbered balance, the current practice is
that it is returned to Member States unless the General Assembly decides
otherwise.

United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus

31. The report of the Secretary-General (A/50/722 and Corr.1) contains the
financial performance of UNFICYP for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1995.
As indicated in the summary, an amount totalling $21,916,600 gross ($21,503,300
net) was approved by the General Assembly for the operation of the Force for the
period under consideration, inclusive of the one-third share of the cost of the
Force to be met through voluntary contributions from the Government of Cyprus
and the annual pledge of $6.5 million of the Government of Greece. Expenditure
totalled $22,249,600 gross ($21,848,100 net), resulting in an overexpenditure of
$333,000 gross ($344,800 net).

32. As indicated in annex II to the Secretary-General’s report, the
overexpenditure of $402,900 for rations resulted primarily from a change in the
supplier of rations from the British Forces to a commercial supplier. Prior to
the commencement of the commercial rations contract on 1 February 1995, the
three contingents were authorized to overdraw an additional 25 per cent of their
monthly consumption for December 1994 and January 1995 in order to stockpile and
ensure a smooth change-over of supplier. The Advisory Committee believes that
since the change-over was expected during the mandate period, the additional
expenditure that had been anticipated should have been budgeted for. In fact,
in this connection, the Committee recalls that it had been informed that rations

/...



A/50/802
English
Page 8

being provided by the British Forces at the rate of $4.50 per person per day
would be discontinued after 31 January 1995 and therefore the budgeted amount
for rations for the period 1 January to 30 June 1995 would be at the rate of
$5.93 per person per day (see A/49/781).

33. On inquiry, the representatives of the Secretary-General informed the
Committee that the claim presented on 21 April 1995 for rations for the period
from 16 June to 31 December 1994 showed a rate of $5.75 per person per day
instead of the budgeted amount of $4.50 per person per day. The increase was
not reflected in the performance report for the period from 16 June to
31 December 1994 and has been carried over into the performance report under
consideration.

34. An overexpenditure in the amount of $2,900 for mission subsistence
allowance has been reported as a result of an overlap in the rotation of
civilian police. The reason for this overlap has not been provided and the
Advisory Committee believes that in a long-established operation such as UNFICYP
unplanned activities should be at a minimum. Furthermore, greater managerial
control should be exercised. Expenditure for items such as utilities should
also be carefully budgeted and kept under control, while savings reported under
data-processing equipment are not actually savings since freight charges have
not yet been claimed by the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi for these
items.

35. The Advisory Committee notes that there has been an overexpenditure of
$589,700 in respect of contractual services through the United Kingdom Command
Secretariat for locally employed civilians (LECs).

36. The Advisory Committee recalls that of the 318 local civilian posts
budgeted for the period from 16 June to 31 December 1994, only 305 had been
filled and that no vacancy factor had been taken into account. Consequently,
for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1995, the Committee had recommended a
reduction in the estimates for this item on the basis of a 2 per cent vacancy
factor. The Committee therefore does not believe that the total number of
318 local posts, as shown in paragraph 10 (a) (ii) of annex II to the Secretary-
General’s report, are occupied.

37. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee recalls that locally recruited
personnel for UNFICYP had been obtained through contractual services from the
United Kingdom Command Secretariat because, even taking account of the
administrative charge payable by UNFICYP, the services thus obtained were more
economical than they would have been if UNFICYP were to hire local personnel
directly. In this connection, the Committee recalls its comment that this
exceptional arrangement would be monitored and would continue only as long as it
was cost-effective (see A/48/907). In this connection, the Committee
understands that pre-employment medical examinations had been completed for
converting 300 personnel previously obtained through contractual services to
locally recruited UNFICYP staff; accordingly, an additional expenditure of
$51,700 is shown against medical treatment and services.

38. The Advisory Committee questioned the overexpenditure relating to
contractual services, in particular the payment of separation costs, including

/...



A/50/802

indemnity payments and travel and bonus payments. The Committee was informed
that LECs have been provided by the British Forces Cyprus since 11 December 1974
to 30 June 1995. These LECs were employed by the Civilian Establishment and Pay
Office (CEPO) of the British Forces Cyprus and were under a labour contract that
was subject to the CEPO regulations and conditions of employment, including
entitlement to terminal benefits, gratuity and indemnity payments. Under their
terms of employment, the LECs were also entitled to an end-of-year bonus and
reimbursement for travel costs in connection with carrying out their duties in
the buffer zone.

39. The arrangement whereby CEPO provided locally employed civilians to UNFICYP
was part of the United Kingdom logistics support to the Force established by the
provisions of paragraph 4 of the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the
United Nations and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland on 11 December 1974. All administrative costs, including
salaries, incurred by CEPO in providing the LECs (except for the charges
incurred by the United Kingdom) were charged to UNFICYP together with an
administrative fee, by the Government of the United Kingdom through the regular
logistic-support billings.

40. On inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that in connection with the
conversion of the LECs to United Nations local staff, legal advice from the
Office of Legal Affairs had been sought regarding the question of liability for
terminal benefits for the LECs; the issue has not been resolved to date. The
Committee was informed that the claim for reimbursement of the costs for the
LECs for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1995 had not yet been paid.

41. In paragraph 6 of his report, the Secretary-General outlines the proposed
actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session in
connection with the financing of UNFICYP. In the opinion of the Advisory
Committee, there is no need for appropriation of an additional amount of
$218,067 gross ($229,867 net) at this time, especially since the indemnity
payment to locally employed civilians (estimated additional expenditures of
$301,300, see A/50/722 and Corr.1, annex II, para. 10 (ii)) is under legal
review. Such additional appropriation as may be necessary should be reflected
in the performance report for the period July to December 1995.

ANNEX

Letter dated 20 November 1995 from the Chairman of the
Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary

Questions to the Secretary-General

The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered your report (A/50/735) on the financing of the United Nations
Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL). The report contains the financial
performance reports of the mission for the periods from 1 December 1994 to
30 April 1995 and from 1 to 31 May 1995 for which the General Assembly had
approved an amount totalling $4,747,500 gross for the operation of the mission
as well as for its liquidation.

As indicated in the report, during the period there was an overexpenditure
of $842,300 gross for which ex post facto commitment authority is being sought.
The Advisory Committee understands that the shortfall will be financed from
savings from prior mandate periods.

The Advisory Committee also understands that the final performance report
on ONUSAL, including its liquidation, will be submitted to the General Assembly
in the first quarter of 1996. The Advisory Committee intends to consider both
reports at that time and will submit its views on the performance and
liquidation of ONUSAL, including the conditions that gave rise to the additional
requirements of $842,300.
