1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for
Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of
the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (A/58/593) and of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious
Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda
and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations
Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31
December 1994 (A/58/597). During its consideration of the reports, the Advisory
Committee met with the representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided
additional information.

A/58/605

I. International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia

2. By its resolution 57/288 of 20 December 2002, the General Assembly
approved a revised appropriation for the biennium 2002-2003 of $262,653,700 gross
($235,955,000 net) for the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

3. Information on trial activity during the biennium 2002-2003 is contained in
annex II to the report (A/58/593). The Advisory Committee notes that the Tribunal
estimates the number of court sessions for the biennium 2002-2003 at 3,402,
compared with the initial estimate of 4,656, owing to the statutory time frames of
the rules of procedure and evidence as well as factors beyond its control. Moreover,
two of the three additional ad litem judges joined the Tribunals as from April 2002,
and a maximum of five trials were conducted during the first three months of the
year instead of the six initially envisaged and currently conducted.

4. As indicated in table 1 of the performance report, expenditures for the period
are estimated at $288,322,200 gross ($254,603,800 net), reflecting additional
requirements of $25,668,500 gross ($18,803,200 net).

5. The Advisory Committee notes that most of the increase ($25,069,200) is the
result of changes with respect to exchange rates resulting from the weakening of the
United States dollar vis-Ã -vis the euro ($21,284,600) and inflation ($3,784,600) (see
ibid., para. 4). The budgetary parameters used for the revised and the proposed final
appropriation are indicated in annex I to the report.

6. The remainder of the increase ($599,300) is shown in table 2 under post
incumbency and other changes. The Advisory Committee notes the overexpenditures
indicated under posts ($8,891,700) and under staff assessment ($5,905,700). The
changes under posts are related to vacancy rates and salary standards (see ibid.,
paras. 7 and 12). A total of 33 and 57 new posts were established in the Office of the
Prosecutor and the Registry respectively, using vacancy rates of 50 per cent for new
Professional posts and 40 per cent for new General Service posts. However, the
posts were filled by July and the second half of 2002 respectively, creating an
impact on the requirements for salary and common staff costs. As to the salary
standards, the common staff cost rate was also higher than budgeted. The increase in
post requirements is consequently reflected under staff assessment, offset by an
equal amount under income from staff assessment.

7. Those increases are offset by decreases under other staff costs ($4,410,300),
travel ($2,836,200), contractual services ($4,958,100) and general operating
expenses ($2,805,900). The decrease under other staff costs ($4,410,300) is the net
result of savings under mission subsistence allowance as a result of fewer than
anticipated personnel stationed in the field ($1,106,600 for the Office of the
Prosecutor and $927,300 for the Registry) and under temporary assistance for
meetings in the Registry ($3,399,900) in view of a lower than anticipated level of
trial activity and savings projected under French reporting services (see ibid., paras.
14-16). These are offset by additional requirements under general temporary
assistance ($1,013,900) for the Registry (see ibid., para. 18).

8. The Advisory Committee requested information regarding the liabilities
arising from an appeal lodged by staff that resulted in retroactive payments (see
ibid.). The Committee was informed that those liabilities related to 90 Professional
staff formerly recruited as local staff under general temporary assistance who



3
A/58/605

claimed international entitlements. Having won their appeal, the staff received
entitlements valued at $1,100,100. The Committee requested additional information
in this regard, which should be provided to the Fifth Committee. As to the additional
requirement in relation to the judicial database project, the Committee was informed
that it amounted to $500,000 and that it had not been foreseen at the time of the
preparation of the budget. Information requested in writing as to the status of the
project should also be provided to the Fifth Committee.

9. An amount of $954,100 is indicated in table 2 under furniture and equipment
related to data-processing equipment and software, audio-visual equipment, security
and safety equipment and communications equipment (see ibid., para. 29). The
Advisory Committee is aware that the changes related to rates of exchange and
inflation could not have been anticipated. However, it is of the opinion that
some of these other items, such as the judicial database project or the furniture
and equipment needs, could have been better planned or foreseen, and thus
better budgeted for. In addition, expenditures should be more closely
monitored.

10. The decrease in travel of $2,836,200 is due mostly to savings amounting to
$2,127,100 in the Office of the Prosecutor, resulting from the reassignment of
investigators to trial work, making them unable to carry out projected investigation
missions, as well as a shorter average duration for missions and lower travel costs
than were initially assumed in the budget (see ibid., para. 10).

11. The decrease in general operating expenses ($2,805,900) is due mostly to
reductions under rental of premises ($1,271,100) (see ibid., paras. 22-23), and the
decrease under contractual services ($4,958,100) is mostly the result of lower
requirements for defence counsel ($4,651,000) due to a reduced number of detainees
and the application of the revised payment system adopted in July 2002 (see ibid.,
para. 21). The information requested by the Advisory Committee regarding the
breakdown of this amount should be provided to the Fifth Committee.

12. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that unliquidated
obligations, as at 30 September 2003, amounted to $14,520,000. The Committee
notes, however, that those amounts could change in view of the impact of changes in
the rate of exchange at the time of their disbursement in future.

13. The action to be taken by the General Assembly is indicated in section III
of the report. The Advisory Committee recommends that the appropriation for
the biennium 2002-2003 for the Special Account for the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia be revised in the amount of $288,322,200
gross ($254,603,800 net).

II. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda

14. By it resolution 57/289 of 20 December 2002, the General Assembly
appropriated a revised amount of $203,962,600 gross ($182,872,700 net) for the
biennium 2002-2003. Information on the trial activities of the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda during the biennium 2002-2003 is provided in annex II to the
report (A/58/597).

15. As indicated in table 1 of the report, the estimated level of resources, based on
actual expenditures for the first 20 months of the biennium and projected



4
A/58/605

requirements for the last 4 months, is $208,479,700 gross ($187,262,900 net) for the
biennium 2002-2003, reflecting additional requirements of $4,517,100 gross
($4,392,200 net). The total resources include requirements related to the
appointment by the Security Council in its resolution 1503 (2003) of a new
Prosecutor for the Tribunal, effective 15 September 2003 (see ibid., paras. 8 and 15).

16. The Advisory Committee notes from table 2 that the resource growth is the
result of the impact of changes in inflation (additional requirements of $11,483,200),
offset by a favourable rate of exchange of the United States dollar against the
Tanzanian shilling and the Rwanda franc (savings of $3,983,600), and savings under
post incumbency and other changes ($2,982,500). The budgetary parameters, related
to rates of exchange, inflation and post adjustment multipliers, used in formulating
the revised budget and the final budget are indicated in annex I to the report.

17. As to the net savings under post incumbency and other changes, the Advisory
Committee notes the reduced requirements of $4,415,500 under posts. The decrease
is the result of higher than expected vacancy rates. The Committee recalls that the
budgetary assumptions included a vacancy rate of 18 per cent for Professional staff
and 12 per cent for staff in the General Service category. For the Office of the
Prosecutor they are 19 per cent for Professional and 17 per cent for General Service
staff during 2002, and 18 per cent for Professional and 14 per cent for General
Service staff from January to August 2003. For the Registry they are 20 per cent for
Professional and 13 per cent for General Service staff during 2002, and 18 per cent
for Professional and 11 per cent for General Service staff from January to August
2003 (see ibid., paras. 7 and 13).

18. The net increase of $2,325,300 under contractual services reflects the
additional requirements for defence counsel fees ($2,380,800) in view of more hours
required than initially anticipated in relation to the Butare and Military 1 cases.

19. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that unliquidated
obligations, as at 30 September 2003, amounted to $9,400,000 (see also para. 12
above).

20. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve
the revised appropriation of $208,479,700 gross ($187,262,900 net) for the
Special Account for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for the
biennium 2002-2003.
