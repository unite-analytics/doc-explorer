decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth
special session: Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters;
United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research

Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003

Request for a subvention to the United Nations Institute
for Disarmament Research resulting from the
recommendations of the Board of Trustees of the Institute
on the work programme of the Institute for 2002

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the note by the
Secretary-General on a request for a subvention of
$213,000 to the United Nations Institute for
Disarmament Research resulting from the
recommendations of the Board of Trustees of the
Institute on the work programme of the Institute for
2002 (A/C.5/56/2). During its consideration of the
report, the Committee met with the Director of the
Institute and other representatives of the Secretary-
General.

2. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
subvention, which is used to cover the costs of the
Director and administration, is important not only
economically, but also to ensure the independence of
the Institute.

3. The Advisory Committee was also informed
during the hearings that the subvention, which used to
cover the costs of three posts, now covers one and a

half posts. The Committee recalled that the Director of
the Institute had noted that for several years, the
subvention had not been adjusted for inflation while
salaries had been so adjusted. It was recalled that the
subvention had temporarily been reduced from
$220,000 to $213,000 for the period 1996-1997 in the
context of the application of General Assembly
resolution 50/214 and that the latter sum had been
repeated for the biennium 1998-1999. The Committee
also recalled that a provision of $213,000 per annum
for the Institute had been included by the Secretary-
General in the programme budget for the biennium
2000-2001,1 and that it is proposed to be maintained at
this level for the period 2002-2003.2

4. By its resolution 55/35 A of 20 November 2000,
on the twentieth anniversary of the United Nations
Institute for Disarmament Research, the General
Assembly recommended that the Secretary-General
seek ways to increase the funding of the Institute,
within existing resources. The Advisory Committee

A/56/511

notes that the aforementioned note by the Secretary-
General does not contain a request to review the level
of the subvention.

5. It is the view of the Advisory Committee that, in
considering whether or not to change the level of the
subvention, article III, paragraph 2 (c), article VII,
paragraph 2, and article VIII, paragraph 3, of the
statute of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament
Research3 should apply. In accordance with article III,
paragraph 2 (c), a recommendation for a subvention
from the regular budget is made by the Board of
Trustees of the Institute. Article VIII, paragraph 3,
provides that the recommendation is transmitted by the
Secretary-General to the General Assembly for
approval. The purpose and level of the subvention are
set out in article VII, paragraph 2:

“A subvention towards meeting the costs of the
Director and the staff of the Institute may be
provided from the regular budget of the United
Nations. The actual amount of any subvention
shall be determined in accordance with article
VIII ...; it may be less than, but shall not exceed,
an amount equivalent to one half of the assured
income of the Institute from voluntary sources in
respect of the year for which a subvention is
being requested.”
