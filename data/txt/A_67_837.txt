  Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions  
 
 

 I. Introduction  
 
 

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has 
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the updated financial position of 
closed peacekeeping missions as at 30 June 2012 (A/67/739). During its 
consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the 
Secretary-General who provided additional information and clarification, 
concluding with written responses received on 5 April 2013.  

2. In paragraphs 1 to 6 of his report, the Secretary-General provides an update on 
the cash position of the 24 closed peacekeeping missions as at 30 June 2012. He 
indicates that, as at that date, 19 of the 24 closed missions had cash surpluses 
available for credit to Member States totalling approximately $28.2 million (see 
table 2), and five closed missions had cash deficits totalling $86.7 million owing to 
outstanding payments of assessed contributions (see tables 3 and 4). The net cash 
balance in closed peacekeeping missions available for credit to Member States as at 
the same date amounted to $28.2 million (see table 1). The Secretary-General 
explains, in paragraph 4, that the cash balance does not take into account the 
$10.8 million owed by closed missions to other closed missions and $51.0 million 
owed by three active missions to closed missions.  

3. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that as at 25 February 
2013, the net cash available for credit to Member States had increased to 
$46.7 million following the repayment of some $18.5 million owed by active 
peacekeeping missions, lowering the amount owed by active peacekeeping missions 
to $32.5 million. The Committee expects that, in accordance with General 
Assembly resolution 65/293, the cash surplus available for credit to Member 
States will be returned in full and in a timely manner (see also para. 6 below).

 II. Outstanding dues to Member States from closed missions  
 
 

4. In paragraph 7 of its resolution 65/293, the General Assembly requested the 
Secretary-General to submit for its consideration and approval concrete proposals 
and alternatives to address the issue of outstanding dues to Member States from 
closed peacekeeping missions that are in net cash deficit. The Secretary-General 
discusses the issue in paragraphs 7 to 10 of his report and offers a new proposal to 
address it. The proposal entails using the total cash assets available in all closed 
missions, amounting to $262.5 million, to settle liabilities amounting to 
$258.8 million, comprising amounts still due to Member States in closed missions 
with cash surpluses ($182.9 million); outstanding claims owed to troop-contributing 
countries in closed missions with cash deficits ($63.1 million); and the amount 
owed to the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund ($12.8 million) (see table 5).  

5. The Advisory Committee recognizes that the Secretary-General’s proposal 
could help to resolve the long-outstanding issue of unpaid claims to troop-
contributing countries. The Committee notes, however, that the bulk of the 
outstanding claims relate to closed missions in cash deficit, whereas the funds 
proposed by the Secretary-General to settle the claims are in closed missions 
with cash surpluses, which, as a matter of principle, should be returned to 
Member States. In this regard, the Committee reiterates the view that 
implementing such a proposal would mean utilizing resources due to Member 
States that have paid their assessed contributions in full to meet the financial 
obligations to the Organization of Member States that have not paid their 
assessed contributions (A/66/713, para. 11).  

6. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Secretary-
General’s proposal did not include the settlement of the amount of $10.8 million 
owed by two closed peacekeeping missions in deficit to closed peacekeeping 
missions with cash surpluses because the amount represented cross-borrowings 
between closed missions. This amount was therefore not necessary to settle the 
overall amounts owed to Member States. The Committee was further informed that 
the settlement of the $10.8 million would depend on the receipt of payments from 
Member States that are in arrears in their payments to those closed peacekeeping 
missions. Upon further enquiry, the Committee was provided with the list of 
amounts, totalling $81.5 million, owed in respect of claims from troop-contributing 
countries as at 30 June 2012. The total comprises $63.1 million owed to troop-
contributing countries by closed missions in net cash deficit and $18.4 million owed 
to troop-contributing countries by closed missions with cash surpluses. The 
Committee recalls the repeated calls by the General Assembly for all Member 
States to pay their assessed contributions in full, on time and without conditions 
(see resolution 65/293). In that regard, the Committee recommends that the 
Secretary-General be requested to use his good offices and engage Member 
States in seeking to resolve the issue of unpaid contributions.  
 
 

 III. Cash requirements of the Organization  
 
 

7. The Secretary-General discusses the cash requirements of the Organization in 
paragraphs 11 to 13 of his report and indicates that cash surpluses of closed 
missions are being used to alleviate the cash shortages of active peacekeeping 
missions because of the unpredictability of the receipt of assessed contributions. He 



 A/67/837
 

3 13-29051 
 

further states that the time lag between the issuance of notifications to Member 
States and the receipt of assessed contributions often ranges from 60 to 120 days. 
Pending the payment of assessed contributions, any cash shortfalls for active 
missions are met from loans from closed peacekeeping missions.  

8. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with information 
showing that, as at 30 June 2012, the average duration of loans from closed missions 
to active peacekeeping missions was 5.5 months (see annex I). The Committee notes 
that during the same period, the cumulative amount borrowed from closed missions 
by active missions grew from $30 million in 2009/10 to $89 million in 2010/11 to 
$118 million in 2011/12. The Committee further notes that the level of borrowing 
peaked at $81 million in August 2011. Taking into account the loans repaid in the 
same period, the Committee notes that the amount owed by active missions to 
closed missions stood at $51.0 million as at 30 June 2012 (see annex II) and 
$32.5 million as at 25 February 2013. The Committee is concerned about the 
continuing reliance on surpluses in closed peacekeeping missions for the cash 
requirements of active missions. In this regard, the Committee reiterates the 
importance of delinking the cash flow requirements of active peacekeeping 
missions from the cash surpluses in closed missions that should be returned to 
Member States (A/66/713, para. 6).  

9. In order to address the issue of cash shortages in active peacekeeping 
missions, the Secretary-General, in paragraph 13 of his report, proposes that the 
General Assembly authorize temporary borrowing between active peacekeeping 
missions, which is currently not permitted according to the terms of the Assembly’s 
resolutions on the financing of peacekeeping operations. He argues that his proposal 
is not expected to have a negative impact on the operations of any active 
peacekeeping mission, as past data on the cash requirements of active missions 
show that their temporary requirements for cross-borrowing have consistently been 
relatively minor compared with the total cash position of all active peacekeeping 
operations at any point in time. The Advisory Committee is concerned that the 
Secretary-General’s proposal provides no details as to the criteria, amounts 
and duration of any such borrowings between active missions.  

10. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the inherent 
unpredictability of the payment of contributions and the lack of any discernible 
pattern in the volume and timing of cross-borrowings in the past made it impossible 
to set any definite limits on either the volume or the duration of the proposed 
inter-mission borrowing. The Committee was also informed that the borrowings 
would be authorized by the Controller on a case-by-case basis, based on a regular 
review of the forecasted cash requirements of each peacekeeping mission and the 
anticipated receipt of assessed contributions. It was also indicated that, in line with 
current practice, no interest would be charged on such inter-mission borrowings.  

11. The Advisory Committee recognizes that the Secretary-General’s proposal, 
by allowing the utilization of cash surpluses of active peacekeeping missions, 
could help to address the cash shortfalls of other active peacekeeping missions, 
hence breaking the reliance on the cash surpluses of closed missions. Such a 
measure would allow the return to Member States of cash surpluses in closed 
missions, which are currently retained in order to manage the cash shortfalls in 
active peacekeeping operations.  



A/67/837

12. The Advisory Committee is of the view, however, that the approval of 
borrowing among active missions without limits and safeguards, even if the 
amounts are small relative to the total cash position of active missions, would 
not be prudent. Moreover, the Committee cautions that the proposal could be 
an inducement to the late payment of assessed contributions. Furthermore, the 
Committee notes that the Secretary-General’s proposal does not address its 
reservations with regard to utilizing resources due to Member States that have 
paid their assessed contributions in full and on time to meet the financial 
obligations to the Organization of Member States that have not paid their 
assessed contributions in a timely manner.  

13. During its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General, the Advisory 
Committee requested information to help it determine how much of the cash balance 
available in closed peacekeeping missions as at 30 June 2012 was attributable to 
interest income. The Committee was informed that the Secretariat was not in a 
position to determine how much of the $211.5 million cash balance was attributable 
to interest income because it comprised balances from several sources and time 
periods, which had gone through several cash returns to Member States. Therefore, 
the ties between the cash balance and its original sources could not be established.  

14. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with information 
showing that, of the total amount of $22.04 billion that had been assessed on all 
closed peacekeeping missions for the duration of their respective mandates, 
contributions totalling $21.62 billion had been received as at 30 June 2012. The 
information also showed that the cumulative interest income earned from the total 
contributions as at the same date amounted to $550.8 million.  

15. The Advisory Committee enquired as to what actions had been taken with 
regard to its earlier suggestion on interest earned and interest accrued (A/66/713, 
para. 12). The Committee was informed that the Secretariat had not proposed any 
changes to the financial regulations pertaining to interest earned and interest 
accrued insofar as they relate to cash balances and possible interest on cash loaned 
internally, because the General Assembly had not indicated its position on the 
matter. It was also noted by the representatives of the Secretary-General that an 
earlier proposal to charge interest on unpaid assessed contributions had not been 
approved by the Assembly (A/60/846/Add.3) and consequently interest was not 
being charged on outstanding assessments receivable from Member States or 
accrued on outstanding amounts payable to Member States. The Committee 
recommends that the Assembly request the Secretary-General to consult with 
other United Nations system entities in order to determine what lessons can be 
drawn from their experience in managing unpaid assessments.  

16. In addition to the proposals contained in the report currently under 
consideration, the Advisory Committee recalls past proposals to address the 
cash requirements of peacekeeping missions, such as applying available credits 
against outstanding contributions and expanding the terms of the Peacekeeping 
Reserve Fund to cover the operational requirements of ongoing missions 
(A/65/556, para. 12). The Committee recommends that the General Assembly 
request the Secretary-General to review those proposals in view of the 
continued borrowing by active peacekeeping missions and also consider other 
possible alternatives, such as the feasibility of establishing a working capital 
fund for peacekeeping missions. The Committee further recommends that the 



 A/67/837
 

5 13-29051 
 

Secretary-General be requested to report on all proposals, including a more 
detailed version of his proposal to allow borrowing between active missions, in 
his next report on closed peacekeeping missions.  
 
 

 IV. Recommendations  
 
 

17. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in paragraph 14 of 
the report of the Secretary-General. In view of its comments and observations in 
the preceding paragraphs, the Advisory Committee recommends that the 
Assembly approve the retention of the net cash balance of $28.2 million 
available in 19 closed peacekeeping missions as at 30 June 2012. The Committee 
further recommends that the updated cash balance be provided to the Assembly 
at the time of its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General.
