Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions on biennial budget estimates
2004-2005

I. Introduction

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Administrator on the biennial budget estimates for the
United Nations Development Programme for the biennium 2004-2005
(DP/2003/28).  During its consideration of the item, the Advisory Committee met
with the Administrator and his representatives, who provided additional
information.

Format and presentation

2. The Advisory Committee notes the improvements in the budget
document in response to its prior recommendations (see DP/2001/24,
paragraphs 2 and 3). The document has been shortened and the proposals are
presented in a more transparent manner. The Committee requests that in the
future, at the time of its examination of the estimates, it should be provided
with an organizational chart that includes the number of posts in each unit at
Headquarters and in the field.

3. As it has done with other Funds and Programmes, the Advisory
Committee requests that UNDP include a separate annex in its future budget
documents, indicating actions taken to implement recommendations of the
Committee, as approved by the Executive Board.

4. The Advisory Committee was informed that in 2004, UNDP would begin a
new multi-year planning period covering the years 2004 through 2007, with the
2004-2005 support budget being an integral part of the 2004-2007 multi-year
funding framework (MYFF). The MYFF is currently being finalized and its
overall strategies and those of the support budget have been developed

DP/2003/29

simultaneously. The biennial support budget for 2004-2005 covers the structural
requirements of the organization during the first half of the planning period, and
the MYFF presents the overall substantive priorities and related frameworks which
are in turn linked to the overall management strategy of UNDP. The overriding
objective of the strategy is to align UNDP fully behind the goals of the reform
agenda of the United Nations Secretary-General.

5. The Advisory Committee notes that the key themes of the UNDP biennial
support budget for 2004-2005 are: “(a) partnering within and external to the
United Nations system; (b) knowledge and learning to enhance UNDP capacity to
support national development goals; and (c) efficiency, performance and results
orientation. In addition, a special focus will be given to crisis prevention and
recovery” (DP/2003/28, paragraph 7).

Resources

6. The Advisory Committee was informed that, in response to the reforms
implemented by UNDP, the declining trend in regular resources has been reversed
with projections for 2003 amounting to $750 million from the low point of $630
million in 2000. Regular resources for 2004 and 2005 are projected at $800 million
and $900 million, respectively. The Committee notes from table 1 of document
DP/2003/28 that regular resources projection of $1 700 million for 2004-2005
remains at the same level as for 2002-2003, while contributions from donors to
other resources increase from $1 329.5 million for 2002-2003 to $1 807.0 million
for 2004-2005, or 35.9 per cent. The Committee also notes that other resources
provided by host governments (i.e., Government cost sharing) also increase from
$2 002.8 million for 2002-2003 to $2 100.0 million for 2004-2005, or 4.9 per cent.
Thus, total contributions to UNDP would increase from $5 032.3 million for 2002-
2003 to $5 607.0, or 11.4 per cent (see DP/2003/28, table 1). In this connection,
the Advisory Committee recalls paragraphs 12 and 13 of its report
DP/2001/24, in which the Committee indicated, inter alia, that the expansion
in UNDP non-core resources needed to be managed in a way that does not
obscure the role of UNDP as the development programme of the United
Nations system.

7. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 130-134 of document
DP/2003/28 that an integral part of the 2004-2005 budget strategy is a revised cost
recovery for UNDP services to: (a) other resource-funded programmes; (b) the
United Nations system at the country level; and (c) services to certain United
Nations entities at the headquarters level. The Committee was informed that
UNDP seeks progressively to achieve a better balance between the contributions of
regular and other resources to the cost of UNDP operations with the
implementation of a revised cost recovery policy, and that related to the revised
policy is the concept of a base structure for headquarters and country offices that
needs to be funded from regular resources, with costs over and above the base
structure to be proportionally shared between regular and other resources.

8. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraphs 30 and 46 of document
DP/2003/28 that, in preparation for the next biennial support budget covering the
period 2006-2007, UNDP intends “a review and classification of activities that are
most appropriately charged to programme resources and to other resources income
so as to reflect a more realistic level of overhead costs in the regular support
budget”…and “consult with the ACABQ and the Executive Board over the next

DP/2003/29

two years to reach a common understanding on cost definitions and classifications
with the aim of reflecting a rationalized approach in the next regular support
budget for 2006/2007.” The Advisory Committee will revert to this matter in the
light of the proposals of the Administrator of UNDP.

II. Biennial support budget for 2004-2005

9. Table 3 of document DP/2003/28 shows that the proposed support budget
for 2004-2005 amounts to $645.5 million (gross), reflecting an increase of $78.6
million, as compared with support budget estimates for 2002-2003 amounting to
$566.9 million (gross). After taking into account projected income to the proposed
support budget for 2004-2005 of $70.3 million, the net proposed support budget
for 2004-2005 amounts to $575.2 million, reflecting an increase of $72.6 million,
as compared to net support budget estimates for 2002-2003 of $502.6 million,
based on a projected income to the support budget for 2002-2003 of $64.3 million.
The summary of main areas of increase/decrease are shown in table 2 of document
DP/2003/28 and explained in paragraphs 32-38 of that budget document. The
Committee was informed that the biennial budget proposed for 2004-2005 should
be viewed in the context of consecutive budget cuts implemented since the 1992-
1993 biennium. During this period, UNDP implemented zero nominal growth
budgets, with one reprieve for a zero real growth budget for the period 1998-1999
(see also DP/2003/28, figure 6).

10. As indicated in tables 4 and 5 of document DP/2003/28, the total number
of proposed posts for 2004-2005 is 3306 posts (617 International Professional, 617
National Professional and 2072 General Service and other categories of staff),
reflecting a net reduction of 16 posts (an increase of 41 International Professional
and 84 National Professional and a decrease of 141 General Service and other
categories of staff), as compared with the approved posts for 2002-2003 of 3322
(576 International Professional, 533 National Professional and 2213 General
Service and other categories of staff). For 2004-2005, 81.1 per cent of the total
number of posts is proposed for country offices, 12.9 per cent is proposed for
headquarters, 5.9 per cent for the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) and 0.1 per
cent for the Inter-Agency Procurement Service Office (IAPSO).

11. The Advisory Committee notes from summary table 4 and paragraphs 37-
38 of document DP/2003/28 that the net reduction of 16 posts proposed for 2004-
2005 include the following changes:

(a) A net increase of 32 internationally recruited posts, comprising: two D-1,
four P-5, six P-4, 19 P-3 and one P-2;

(b) A net decrease of two locally recruited posts at headquarters; and

(c) A net decrease of 46 local posts at the country level, comprising a decrease
of 130 General Service posts and an increase of 84 National Professional posts.

12. The UNDP structure and related senior level posts is addressed in
paragraphs 49-55 and shown in detail in summary table 4 of document
DP/2003/28. The proposals for 2004-2005 include 39 net reclassifications of
international posts, including 22 reclassifications at the D-2 and D-1 levels.



4
DP/2003/29

13. The Committee was provided with a list of senior posts being proposed for
reclassification to the D-2 and D-1 levels (see annex I to this report). In the field,
two posts would be upgraded to the D-2 and 18 posts to the D-1 level, most
relating to the resident coordinator/resident representative and deputy resident
representative categories. At headquarters, two posts are proposed for
reclassification to the D-2 level for the post of Director, Office of the
Administrator, and the Director, Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian
People; and three posts are proposed for reclassification to the D-1 level for the
Director, Liaison Office in Tokyo, the Director, Administration of the United
Nations Volunteers in Bonn and the Division Director, North East Asia Division,
Regional Bureaus of Asia and the Pacific.

14. For headquarters, one additional D-1 post is proposed for the Director of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Coordination Office, Bureau of
Resources and Strategic Partnerships.

15. The Advisory Committee has expressed concern in the past about
proposals for upward reclassification of posts of Funds and Programmes of
the United Nations, particularly to the D-1 and   D-2 levels, stating that they
must be as the result of significant changes in the level and scope of
responsibility of the posts.  The Committee recommends that the Executive
Board should bear this in mind during its review of the UNDP proposals for
upward reclassifications of post to the D-1 and D-2 levels at Headquarters
and in the field.

16. The Advisory Committee notes that the Emergency Response Division was
upgraded in November 2001 to become the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and
Recovery. Currently the Bureau has six positions funded from the regular support
budget. Fifteen positions funded from other resources are proposed to be funded
from the regular support budget for 2004-2005, thus providing the Bureau with a
basic infrastructure of 21 posts (DP/2003/28, paragraphs 53 and 80). For the
Geneva based operations, the Committee was informed that a new post at the D-1
level was requested for the Deputy Director of the Bureau. For the reasons given
in the report (DP/2003/28, paragraphs 77-81) and taking into account its past
observations on emergency response (DP/2001/24, paragraphs 39-40), the
Committee recommends acceptance of the proposals of the Administrator.

17. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 80 of document
DP/2003/28 that the Administrator proposes the establishment of an Assistant-
Secretary-General post under the regular support budget for the Director of the
Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery. The Committee recalls from the
exchange of correspondence with the Administrator in November 2001 that the
position was established in November 2001 at the level of Assistant Administrator
for the Director of the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery to be funded
from extrabudgetary resources in 2002-2003 and to be reviewed in the context of
the budget estimates for 2004-2005. The Committee interposes no objection to
the proposal of the Administrator to establish a post at the Assistant
Secretary-General level for Assistant Administrator and Director of the
Bureau for Crises Prevention and Recovery in the regular support budget for
2004-2005.

Information and communications technology

18. Proposed ICT activities are discussed in paragraphs 124-129 of document
DP/2003/28. The total amount proposed for ICT investment in 2004-2005 amounts
to $37.6 million under the regular support budget (DP/2003/28, table 10). The
Advisory Committee was informed that process re-engineering and the maximum
utilization of information and communication technology would continue to be key
management priorities. The implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system during 2004-2005 would enable UNDP to further rationalize the
different tiers of management and operations in UNDP between corporate, regional
and country levels. The Committee was provided with a detailed plan of ICT
activities to be implemented in 2004-2005 (see annex II to this report).

III. Biennial support budget for 2004-2005 of funds
administered by UNDP

19. The report  of the Administrator includes the biennial support budget of
two Funds administered by UNDP and which the Executive Board approves
separately, namely the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and
the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) (DP/2003/28,
paragraphs 138-149). The budget estimates of these two Funds are presented in
line with the harmonization of budgets and follow the same terminology as the
UNDP support budget.

United Nations Capital Development Fund

20. The UNCDF resource plan for the period 2004-2005 is provided in table 11
of document DP/2003/28. Income projections for 2004-2005 for both regular and
other resources amounts to $83 million, as compared with a projected income level
of $71.0 million for 2002-2003. The Committee was informed that the income
projections for 2004-2005 reflect a positive trend in other resources mobilization,
estimated at $20 million for 2004-2005, as compared to $5.0 million for 2002-
2003. The proposed biennial support budget of UNCDF for 2004-2005 amounts to
$14.4 million, as compared with the approved biennial support budget for 2002-
2003 of $13.6 million.

21. The proposed distribution of posts is shown in summary table 7(b). The
biennial support budget for 2004-2005 provides for a total of 32 posts, as
compared with 38 posts for 2002-2003. The Committee was informed that
streamlining of functions and improvements in efficiency allowed post reductions
and cost containment; however, this reduction in real terms is offset by cost
increases due to inflation projections and mandatory salary related increases for
2004-2005, resulting in an increase in the proposed budget for 2004-2005.

United Nations Development Fund for Women

22. The UNIFEM resource plan is shown in table 12 of the budget report. The
Advisory Committee notes that the income projection for 2004-2005 for both
regular and other resources amounts to $83.3 million, reflecting an increase of 7.9
per cent, as compared with a projected income level for both regular and other
resources of $77.2 million for 2002-2003. The proposed biennial support budget of



6
DP/2003/29

UNIFEM for 2004-2005 amounts to $14.9 million, or 30.2 per cent of its income
projection for regular resources for 2004-2005 of $49.4 million. For 2002-2003,
the UNIFEM biennial support budget amounted to $12.3 million, or 27.3 per cent
of the income projection for regular resources for 2002-2003 of $45.1 million. The
Committee recalls its observations in paragraph 56 of its report DP/2001/24
and notes with concern that although the regular resource projections of
UNIFEM for 2004-2005 shows some increase (9.5 per cent), its support budget
for 2004-2005 increases more than in proportion (21.1 per cent as compared
to the budget for 2002-2003). The Committee was informed that UNIFEM is
currently undertaking a series of consultations with governments, United Nations
and non-governmental organizations partners to finalize the strategy and plan of
the Fund for 2004-2007 and will submit it for consideration to the Executive Board
at the first regular session in January 2004.
