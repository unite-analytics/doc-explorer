10. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 11 of the report of the
Secretary-General that, while there is no need to appropriate additional resources for
UNOSOM II, payment of outstanding claims cannot be effected owing to the
shortage of cash in the UNOSOM II special account, resulting from the high level of
unpaid assessed contributions. In view of the cash shortage, the concurrence of the
General Assembly is sought to suspend the provisions of financial regulations 4.3,
4.4 and 5.2 (d) in respect of the remaining surplus of $21,324,700 gross
($20,374,400 net).

11. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of UNOSOM are indicated in paragraph 1 of the report of the Secretary-
General. The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the proposals of
the Secretary-General.
