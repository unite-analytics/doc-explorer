Proposed programme budget outline for the
biennium 2004-2005

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed programme budget
outline for the biennium 2004-2005 (A/57/85). In the course of its deliberations, the
Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information and clarifications.

2. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 2 of the report that, in
establishing a preliminary estimate for the biennium 2004-2005, the current level of
appropriations and related commitments, namely, $2,699.9 million, was taken as the
starting point. On that basis, the Secretary-General proposes a preliminary estimate
of resources for the biennium 2004-2005, expressed in initial 2002-2003 prices,
amounting to $2,857.9 million, as shown in the table contained in paragraph 2 of the
report. As indicated in paragraph 12 of the report of the Secretary-General, the
preliminary estimate, excluding special political missions, reflects real growth of
$47.8 million or 1.8 per cent, compared with the approved appropriations and
related provisions for the biennium 2002-2003. Once account is taken of the full
inclusion of required provisions for special political missions, the total preliminary
estimate of $2,857.9 million would represent an increase of $158.0 million, or 5.8
per cent, compared with existing provisions for the biennium 2002-2003.

3. The Advisory Committee recalls its observation in paragraph 3 of its previous
report on the budget outline (A/55/685) that the purpose of the budget outline is to
provide Member States with a preliminary indication of the resources that may be
required in the coming biennium.

4. As indicated in paragraph 3 of the report of the Secretary-General, an amount
of $25.3 million would be required for full biennial provision in 2004-2005 for posts
that are partially funded in the current biennium. These are new posts at the



2
A/57/636

Professional level and above, which had been costed at 50 per cent for the biennium
2002-2003. The Advisory Committee notes the proposal of the Secretary-General, in
paragraph 3 of his report, that consideration will be given to costing all new posts on
a full-cost basis. The Advisory Committee finds no convincing arguments for
changing the current costing parameters for new posts at the Professional level
and above categories, in view of the delays in recruitment for new posts
experienced by the Secretariat, and to preserve the transparency inherent in
separating the delayed recruitment factor for new posts from the vacancy rate
for continuing posts.

5. As indicated in paragraph 4 of the report, a provision of $47.8 million, relating
to one-time costs in 2002-2003, would not be required. This provision related
mainly to one-time construction costs associated with security enhancement at
Headquarters and offices away from Headquarters; in addition, these are non-
recurrent costs for substantive and public information support for the special
sessions of the General Assembly and associated plenary meetings on children and
for special conferences on financing for development, the Second World Assembly
on Ageing and the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

6. The preliminary estimates for the biennium 2004-2005 include a provision of
$29.8 million in respect of the need to ensure that information technology and
common services facilities infrastructure are brought to the levels which will not
prejudice programme delivery. The Committee notes from paragraph 5 of the report
that these resources are envisaged to be distributed across the parts of the budget
which were affected by the economy measures instituted consequent upon the
adoption of the 2002-2003 initial appropriations. While the Committee does not
question the need for adequate investments in technological innovations and
facilities infrastructure at the United Nations, it is of the view that more
information should have been provided in support of the estimated
requirements of $29.8 million, especially on the programmatic impact of the
reductions it is intended to offset. In this connection, as indicated in its report
on the performance report (A/57/7/Add.16, para. 3), the Advisory Committee
intends to consider, in the context of the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2004-2005, appropriate changes to the performance report in the
light of the development of results-based budgeting.

7. The budget outline includes an amount of $40.5 million for new or expanded
activities or events foreseen and/or mandated in 2004-2005. As indicated in
paragraph 6 of the report of the Secretary-General, these resources would be
required in connection with reinforcement of programmes to enhance capacity for
meeting strategies outlined in the “road map” (A/56/326), including strengthening
peace-building, human rights and humanitarian assistance, the economic and social
sector, as well as conference-servicing and the United Nations Office at Nairobi. In
this connection, the Advisory Committee points out that provision for peace-
building activities is supposed to be covered under the lump-sum allocation for
special political and other missions. Provisions are also envisaged for follow-on
requirements for strengthening of the security improvements at the United Nations
Office at Geneva, including additional building protection improvements and
implementation of the second phase of the intermediate surveillance system. With
regard to the security improvements at the United Nations Office at Geneva, the
Advisory Committee recalls that this provision for Geneva in the biennium 2004-
2005 was foreseen in paragraph 18 of the report of the Secretary-General on



3
A/57/636

strengthening the security and safety of United Nations premises (A/56/848), which
included the following sentence: “The further strengthening of the security
infrastructure, including additional building protection improvements, partitioning
of buildings and implementation of the second phase of the intermediate
surveillance system, which are estimated at this stage in the amount of $5.6 million,
would be proposed in the context of the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2004-2005.” No other requirements for security enhancements were
foreseen at other duty stations in respect of the biennium 2004-2005 in the report of
the Secretary-General (A/56/848) and, hence, none are reflected in the outline for
other duty stations.

8. As indicated in paragraph 7 of the budget outline, the requirements for special
political missions are projected at the level of the current biennium, that is, $223.3
million. According to the Secretary-General, while the present composition of
special political missions will change somewhat in the biennium 2004-2005, it is not
anticipated that the overall level will trend downwards. Taking into account the
existing provision of $113.1 million made by the General Assembly for special
political missions, an additional amount of $110.2 million has been included by the
Secretary-General in the budget outline for the biennium 2004-2005.

9. The Advisory Committee points out that the requirements for special
political missions in the amount of $223.3 million gross, shown in paragraph 7
of the report of the Secretary-General, were estimated about six months ago, in
May-June 2002. The Secretariat has recently informed the Committee that the
updated requirements for special political missions for the biennium 2002-2003
are now estimated at $215 million gross ($201.2 million net) (see A/57/7/Add.17,
annex I). The related recommendations of the Committee on the estimates (see
para. 49 of A/57/7/Add.17), subject to the approval of the General Assembly,
would entail their further reduction from $215 million gross ($201.2 million
net) to $206 million gross ($192.2 million net); the question of the financing of
the special political missions during the biennium 2002-2003 is currently under
consideration by the General Assembly. The Committee points out that any
projection of this estimate for 2004-2005 should take into account the fact that
it includes requirements for missions which will be terminated or for which
mandates will be altered in scope. On the other hand, it could also be assumed
that there may be new mandates for missions which are at present unforeseen.
Under the circumstances, for purposes of the preliminary estimate, and bearing
in mind the provisions of paragraph 11 of the annex to General Assembly
resolution 41/213, the Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the provision
for special political missions in the outline should not exceed $170 million gross.

10. In paragraph 8 of the budget outline (A/57/85), the Secretary-General invites
the General Assembly “to consider whether special political missions are susceptible
for treatment within the present regular budget procedures for estimating
requirements in the budget outline and subsequent programme budgets”.

11. In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls that, in paragraph 8 of
its report on the budget outline for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/55/685), the
Committee observed that “inasmuch as the requirements for special political
missions are of a continuing nature, the estimates should continue to be
included in the budget outline”. The Committee also pointed out that, as
reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 53/206, the outline should



4
A/57/636

provide a greater level of predictability of resources required for the following
biennium, promote greater involvement of Member States in the budgetary
process and thereby facilitate the broadest possible agreement on the
programme budget. The Committee observed, in this connection, that omission
of the requirements for special political missions runs counter to those
purposes and recommended that “an amount for special political missions be
included in the budget outline”. The Advisory Committee finds no convincing
reasons for changing its views on this matter at this time and believes that more
experience is required before consideration is given to changing the current
procedure, which has been in place only since the outline for the biennium
2002-2003. The Committee therefore recommends that provision for special
political missions should continue to be included in the outline.

12. The size of the contingency fund is discussed in paragraph 13 of the report of
the Secretary-General. As stated therein, the size of the contingency fund is
recommended by the Secretary-General to be maintained at 0.75 per cent of the
proposed outline for the biennium 2004-2005, or $21.4 million. The Advisory
Committee concurs with the Secretary-General’s proposal and points out that
the contingency fund will be utilized in accordance with General Assembly
resolutions 41/213 and 42/211. This should be brought to the attention of
governing bodies whenever decisions involving financial implications are taken.

13. The Advisory Committee was informed on 12 December 2002 that the 2004-
2005 budget outline figure of $2,857.9 million would be replaced by $2,975.1
million when using the same set of rates and standard costing assumptions which
have been applied to the first performance report for the biennium 2002-2003. The
Advisory Committee points out that the overall level of estimated requirements for
the biennium 2004-2005 would depend, in part, on the decision of the General
Assembly on the recommendations of the International Civil Service Commission
currently under consideration in the Fifth Committee.

14. The Advisory Committee therefore recommends that the General
Assembly adopt a preliminary estimate of $2,920.0 million for the biennium
2004-2005 at the revised 2002-2003 rates. Before adopting this outline level, the
General Assembly may also wish to take into account the observations and
comments made by the Advisory Committee in the paragraphs above. These
comments and observations should also be taken into account by the Secretary-
General when preparing the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2004-2005.
