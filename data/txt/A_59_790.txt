Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations

Updated financial position of closed peacekeeping missions

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/752) on the updated financial
position as at 30 June 2004 of the 18 closed missions listed in paragraph 1 of that
report.

2. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in its resolution
57/323, requested the Secretary-General to return 50 per cent of the net cash
available for credit to Member States as at 30 June 2002, in the amount of
$84,446,000, by 30 June 2003, and decided to postpone the return of the remaining
50 per cent until March 2004 in respect of the fund balances of the United Nations
peacekeeping operations listed in paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General’s report
A/58/778. In its resolution 58/288, the General Assembly subsequently decided to
postpone the return of the amount of $84,446,000 until 30 June 2004. No further
decision has been taken since then.

3. The Advisory Committee notes from table 1 of the report of the Secretary-
General (A/59/752) that the net cash available for credit to Member States as at
30 June 2004 amounted to $92,898,000, exclusive of the amount of $43,750,000
that has not yet been credited to Member States.

4. As indicated in paragraph 7 of the report of the Secretary-General, outstanding
loans totalling $49,816,000 were owed to closed peacekeeping missions as at
30 June 2004. New loans amounting to $76 million were made between 1 July and
28 February 2005 to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),
the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia and the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda. Taking into account the repayment of $68 million by UNMIK,
as at 28 February 2005 the amount of outstanding loans had increased by $8 million,
to $57,816,000, and the updated cash position of closed peacekeeping missions was
$84,898,000.

5. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 5 of the report of the
Secretary-General that 7 of the 18 peacekeeping missions included in the report had
cash deficits totalling some $93.2 million as at 30 June 2004 due to outstanding
payments of assessed contributions. The overall cash deficit of these seven missions
has been reduced from the $100.5 million indicated in the previous report of the
Secretary-General on this subject (see A/58/778, table 4). Upon request, the
Committee was provided with comparative data concerning the previous period as
well as explanations concerning the movements in the special accounts of these
missions during the 2003/04 period. The Committee was also provided with
information on unpaid assessments, accounts payable to Member States and other
liabilities of closed missions as at 30 June 2004 (see annex). The Advisory
Committee requests that this information be provided on a routine basis in
future reports.

6. From the additional information provided, the Advisory Committee notes that
the total reduction of the deficits of closed peacekeeping missions during the period
1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 amounted to $7,837,000, including $319,000 for the
United Nations Operation in Mozambique, $2,755,000 for the United Nations
Operation in Somalia, $550,000 for the United Nations Support Mission in
Haiti/United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti/United Nations Civilian Police
Mission in Haiti, $384,000 for the United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia, $465,000 for the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and
$3,364,000 for the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic. The
main factors contributing to the reduction of the deficits were the payment of
assessed contributions, savings on or cancellation of prior period obligations,
collection of other accounts receivable and interest income.

7. With respect to unpaid assessments, the Advisory Committee draws attention
to the observations of the Board of Auditors on the deterioration of the financial
situation of peacekeeping operations during the 2003/04 period (see A/59/5, vol. II,
chap. II, paras. 13-19). The Advisory Committee also discusses this issue in its
general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).

8. In paragraph 9 of his report (A/59/752), the Secretary-General indicated that
the cash available in the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund amounted to $134.1 million as
at 28 February 2005, of which $100 million had already been authorized under the
terms of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A. The available cash in the
Peacekeeping Reserve Fund is not sufficient to meet all of the foreseeable cash
requirements, in particular for the start-up of the United Nations Mission in the
Sudan and the expansion of the United Nations Organization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pending the payment of assessed contributions,
the shortfall would have to be met from loans from closed peacekeeping missions,
and the Secretary-General proposes that the cash balance of $92,898,000 available
in the 11 closed peacekeeping missions as at 30 June 2004 be retained. The
Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the Secretary-General’s
proposals.
