Strengthening the security and safety of United Nations
operations, staff and premises

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction

1. The report of the Secretary-General (A/58/756) contains supplementary budget
proposals for the biennium 2004-2005 submitted in accordance with regulations 2.8
and 2.9 of the United Nations Financial Regulations and Rules. The total estimated
requirements of $92,433,500 comprise the following:

• $71,881,600 under the United Nations regular budget, including special
political missions;

• $6,467,700 to be funded by other organizations at Vienna through cost-
sharing;1

• $609,900 under the budget for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda;

• $13,474,300 under United Nations peacekeeping operations.

II. Background information and general considerations

2. The Advisory Committee recalls that, following the events of 11 September
2001 in the United States, the Secretary-General took a number of steps to
strengthen the security and safety of the United Nations. The short-term measures
and related requirements of $3,573,600 were reported to the General Assembly at its
fifty-sixth session in the second performance report on the programme budget for
the biennium 2001-2002 (A/56/674 and Corr.1). Subsequently, the Secretary-
General reported that those short-term measures had been largely implemented (see
A/56/848).

3. The long-term measures for the strengthening of security and safety were set
out by the Secretary-General in his report (A/56/848). According to the Secretary-
General, the measures were based on a comprehensive review of arrangements at
Headquarters and other main locations, supplemented by the findings of security
assessment missions to the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional
commissions. The total estimated cost of the proposed measures amounted to
$57,785,300, including the cost of 130 new regular budget posts. Of those, 60
Security Officer posts were proposed for the regional commissions to allow for
discontinuing the outsourcing of security functions in line with the policy
established by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/232. The General
Assembly, by its resolution 56/286, approved the proposed measures and
appropriated the requested funding of $57,785,300. The Secretary-General reported
on the status of appropriations and expenditures relating to strengthening the
security and safety of the United Nations premises in the context of his first and

4. As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/58/756),
the work programme for 2002-2003 approved by the General Assembly in its
resolution 56/286 for improving security was largely implemented at the United
Nations Offices at Vienna and Nairobi and at the Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC),
the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the
Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA); at Headquarters and
the United Nations Office at Geneva the security-related infrastructure projects are
still in various stages of implementation. The Committee was informed, upon
enquiry, that the uncommitted balance of funds under the account for construction in
progress had been reduced from $28.5 million as at 31 December 2003 to $10.8



4
A/58/758

million as at 25 March 2004.2 The bulk of the balance falls under the United Nations
Office at Geneva ($9.6 million) and Headquarters ($1.1 million). According to the
Secretariat, the total commitments of $31.8 million under the construction-in-
progress account as at 25 March 2004, include pre-encumbrances, disbursements
and obligations, as follows:

Disbursements Obligations Pre-encumbrances Total commitments

Duty station (United States dollars)

Headquarters 2 483 400 1 763 700 20 594 500 24 841 600

Geneva 66 200 5 852 700 - 5 918 900

Nairobi 11 600 509 400 - 521 000

ECA 9 300 315 600 - 324 900

ECLAC 88 300 - - 88 300

ESCAP 50 800 49 700 - 100 500

Total 2 709 600 8 491 100 20 594 500 31 795 200

The Advisory Committee has expressed its concern that the high level of pre-
encumbrances is indicative of slow progress in the implementation of projects
funded from the construction-in-progress account. The Committee was informed
on 2 April 2004 that the contract for the outstanding New York-based pre-
encumbrance of $21.6 million has been signed and obligations recorded in the same
amount, and that there is no uncommitted balance for Headquarters in respect of
appropriations for 2002-2003.

5. The report of the Secretary-General (A/58/756) contains proposals for a first
phase of urgently required new measures for the strengthening of security and safety
based on a review of arrangements at Headquarters and field locations. This is to be
followed by a further report to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session
proposing a second phase of longer-term measures after the completion of an
ongoing change management study on security arrangements. According to the
Secretary-General, these two sets of measures will represent a comprehensive global
response to the radically altered security situation which the Organization faces
since the direct attacks on United Nations operations and facilities in 2003.

6. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that, optimally, resource
requests for the strengthening of safety and security should be based on and
preceded by a comprehensive and completed review of security arrangements,
including the change management study referred to in paragraph 1 of the
Secretary-General’s report and specific information on arrangements for
cooperation and collaboration with host country authorities and organizations
of the United Nations system at each location. The piecemeal approach now
being followed, especially so soon after the last and fairly recent round of
comprehensive reviews and security enhancements, has made a proper
consideration of the estimates very difficult.

A/58/758

7. The Advisory Committee was not provided with the necessary expert
analysis, including information as to what kind of threat scenarios were
assessed, the recommended responses and how these would translate into the
resources requested in the report. These estimates, are in effect, being
examined in isolation and not as a component of an overall and properly
justified and prioritized programme of security enhancement. The Committee
has borne the foregoing in mind during its consideration of the estimates, as
well as the fact that more than two years after the issuance of the Secretary-
General’s last report on this matter (A/56/848; see also General Assembly
resolution 56/286), significant elements of urgent need have still not been
completed (see paras. 3 and 4 above).

III. Resource requirements

A. Recommendations on posts

1. Regular budget

8. Three Local-level posts for security guards for the Office of the United Nations
Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process under section 3, Political
affairs. These posts are requested to supplement the 13 existing security-related
posts of the Office. The Advisory Committee recommends the establishment of
these posts.

9. Two General Service (Other level) posts for security officers under section 7,
International Court of Justice. These posts are requested to strengthen security
coverage of the entrance/reception area of the Peace Palace as well as for the
Registry building, and to provide security coordination with the Carnegie
Foundation. The Advisory Committee recommends the establishment of these
posts.

10. Two posts, one P-3 and one General Service (Other level) under section 29D,
Office of Central Support Services. These posts are requested to strengthen the
existing capacity of the Fire and Safety Unit for hazardous material detection and
response to biological threats. The Advisory Committee recommends the
establishment of these posts.

11. One hundred and sixteen posts, for 58 Field Security Officers, including 6 P-5
and 52 P-4/3, and 58 General Service (Local level) posts for the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator under section 31, Jointly financed administrative
activities. These posts are to be deployed in the countries considered as having high
security risk. As indicated in the report, the proposal is made “given the pressing
need for immediate strengthening of the operations of the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator, and pending the recommendations from the review of
the structure and procedures of security arrangements for the Organization as a
whole to be submitted to the General Assembly in September”. The Advisory
Committee understands that 58 of these 116 posts already exist but are currently
financed through extrabudgetary sources and are managed in the field by the United
Nations Development Programme. In view of uncertainties which exist with
regard to continued assured funding for these posts, the Committee has no



6
A/58/758

objection to their conversion to regular budget financing, provided that cost-
sharing arrangements are applied (see para. 31 below).

12. The Advisory Committee points out that no information was provided on
whether, or to what extent, other alternatives have been considered in crisis
management, such as responding to a crisis situation by dispatching a team of
security officers. The Committee recalls that the United Nations Security
Coordinator informed the High-level Committee on Management of a new system of
security management, whereby each field security officer is provided with a
dedicated budget to permit him/her to operate effectively in the field, which would
enable the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator “to react quickly by
shifting field security officers from one duty station to another in response to crisis
situations” (see CEB/2003/3, para. 10 (a)). Moreover, in considering this request
for additional posts, an analysis must be provided of the relationship between
these resources and what would be available to the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and through general temporary assistance. The
Committee notes that requests are made for security posts under the budgets of a
number of United Nations peacekeeping operations and the equivalent of 164
security-related posts are requested under general temporary assistance, including 12
for the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator (see paras. 14 and 16
below). The Committee has requested that the next report of the Secretary-General
on security set forth definitive measures for cooperation between the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator
in the area of field security (see para. 30 below).

13. Under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends that
action on the request for the remaining 58 additional posts for the Office of the
United Nations Security Coordinator be deferred pending the comprehensive
report on security to be submitted by the Secretary-General to the General
Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. In that report the human resource
requirements of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator should
be analysed taking into account the concerns expressed above and complete
and fully justified proposals should be made which would allow the Office to
operate efficiently and effectively in the field. Pending such consideration, any
extraordinary and/or urgent needs can be met, on a temporary basis, through
redeployment of existing resources and/or by using extrabudgetary funds,
should they materialize. The recommendation of the Advisory Committee on
the staffing of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator would
involve a reduction of $5,580,200 in the estimates for the United Nations
regular budget and an increase of $2,469,000 in the estimates for the costs to be
funded by other United Nations organizations.

2. Budgets of United Nations peacekeeping operations

14. The following additional posts are requested for funding under the budgets of
United Nations peacekeeping operations:

(a) Two Field Service staff and 15 National Officers for MINURSO;

(b) One P-3, Chief of Security, for UNDOF;

(c) One P-3, Chief of Security, for UNIFIL;

(d) Six (Field Service) security officers for UNOMIG.



7
A/58/758

15. The Committee has no objection to the proposed establishment of these
posts. The Committee points out, however, that staff costs related to these posts
should be accommodated within the budgets of individual peacekeeping
operations and included in their performance reports. This recommendation
would entail a reduction of $1,514,900 from the proposed additional
appropriation.

B. General temporary assistance

16. An additional provision of $6,209,700 is proposed under the regular budget for
the six-month period from 1 July to 31 December 2004 under general temporary
assistance to provide funding for 164 posts broken down by office/location and
grade as follows:

A/58/758

17. The Advisory Committee points out that very little information was
received to support the level of general temporary assistance requested. As with
other requests in the report of the Secretary-General, the request for general
temporary assistance was difficult to analyse in the absence of a comprehensive
and coherent plan which will be made available only in the autumn. Moreover,
the Committee is of the opinion that the proposal lacks transparency; it had the
impression that in a number of instances general temporary assistance was
proposed instead of a higher number of additional posts, which would then be
requested in future presentations as a conversion from general temporary
assistance. Under the circumstances, the Committee recommends approval, at
this time, of an additional $3 million, as a lump sum to be used flexibly by the
Secretary-General to meet urgent requirements arising between now and the
time when the General Assembly takes action on the Secretary-General’s
“second phase” report.

18. An additional provision of $509,400 is requested under the budget of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for the six-month period from 1 July to
31 December 2004 under general temporary assistance for 32 General Service
(Local level) positions to provide enhanced round-the-clock security at various
entrance and exit points of the Tribunal’s headquarters. The additional 32 positions
would augment the current security force of 44 General Service/Security Service
and 59 General Service/Local level. The Committee has no objection to the
requested provision for general temporary assistance, but this provision should
be accommodated within the budget of the Tribunal and included in the
performance report.

19. No additional provision for general temporary assistance is requested for the
United Nations peacekeeping operations.

C. Other recommendations

1. Infrastructure/premises under the United Nations regular budget

20. An additional provision of $38 million is requested under section 33,
Construction, alteration, improvement and major maintenance of the regular budget
for improvements to premises. The provision represents one-time costs of security-
related measures at Headquarters in New York, Geneva, Nairobi, and at ECA,
ESCAP and ECLAC. The provision does not include the requirements for the United
Nations Office at Vienna (see para. 26 below).

21. The estimated additional requirements of $38 million for improvements of
premises relate to the estimated cost of ongoing projects, that is, those which were
proposed by the Secretary-General (see A/56/848) and approved by the General
Assembly in resolution 56/286, and new projects, as follows:

ECLAC - 210 000 210 000

Total 21 915 600 16 117 600 38 033 200

22. With regard to the security-related improvements of premises at Headquarters
in New York, the Committee notes from annex II to the Secretary-General’s report
(A/58/756) that the implementation of a number of projects with a total estimated
cost in excess of $5 million are to be deferred to a “later stage”. However, no
information is provided on when the projects could be resumed. Given the
uncertainty with regard to the implementation date of these projects, the
Committee questions the rationale for including their cost at this time.

23. With regard to the requirements for the United Nations Office at Geneva, the
Committee is concerned about a very sharp increase in costs estimates for some
ongoing projects; the Committee trusts that the report on security and safety to
be submitted by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its fifty-
ninth session will provide detailed explanations of cost overruns. The
Committee also expects that that report will propose comprehensive measures
that would take into account the security concerns of all United Nations offices,
agencies, funds and programmes at Geneva (see para. 33 below).

24. The Committee was informed that the proposed additional requirements for
Geneva include not only the cost of security improvements inside the premises but
also the costs of strengthening the security perimeter, which were expected to be
met by the Government of Switzerland; the Secretariat continues to raise the issue of
the host country’s responsibility for security improvements along the security
perimeter and access to the Palais des Nations (see A/58/756, para. 37). The
Committee requests that the Secretary-General intensify his efforts in the
ongoing negotiations on this matter with the host country. The Committee
stresses that the security of the United Nations at every duty station is
primarily the responsibility of the host country, which should provide all the
required protection of the United Nations outside the perimeter of the United
Nations district in that country. Assurances of host country cooperation should
be included in the next report of the Secretary-General.

25. Taking into account what has been stated in paragraphs 4 and 22 to 24
above, especially with regard to the pace of implementation of previously
approved projects, the significant and, as yet, unexplained cost overruns for
ongoing projects, and the lack of a comprehensive plan with well-explained
priorities, the Committee recommends deferral of the request of $16.1 million
for new projects pending consideration by the General Assembly of the



10

A/58/758

Secretary-General’s forthcoming comprehensive report. The Committee notes
that the unencumbered balance as at 31 December 2003 of $28.5 million, and
additional requirements of $21.9 million for ongoing projects, total $50.4
million. Notwithstanding the recent signing of construction contracts (see para.
4 above), the Committee is satisfied that there is a great deal of work on
existing projects which can be carried out until the end of 2004.

2. Infrastructure/premises at Vienna

26. The United Nations share of the total of the estimated $8.4 million additional
requirement for the United Nations Office at Vienna amounts to $1.9 million, which
is budgeted for under grants and contributions. The Committee was informed that
the secretariats of Vienna-based international organizations (the United Nations
Office at Vienna, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty Organization) and the host country authorities are still in consultations on
issues related to the financing of security enhancement requirements. Information
provided to the Committee confirms that all previously approved projects for the
enhancement of security at Vienna have been completed. It was also confirmed to
the Committee that participating administrations are in agreement as to the work to
be carried out. Under the circumstances, the Committee recommends approval
of the proposals for Vienna, on the understanding that in his next report the
Secretary-General will provide specific information on the results of the
consultations now being carried out between the Vienna-based organizations
and the host Government.

3. Infrastructure/premises for peacekeeping operations

27. A total additional provision of $11,959,400 is made under the budgets of
United Nations peacekeeping operations for improvements of facilities and
infrastructure, as follows:

MONUC: $1,521,300

UNAMSIL: $163,000

UNDOF: $63,200

UNFICYP: $2,176,900

UNMEE: $7,000,000

UNMISET: $345,000

UNOMIG: $690,000

This provision represents additional requirements over and above the estimates
submitted by the Secretary-General in his budget estimates for peacekeeping
operations for the financial period 2004/05. The Advisory Committee is of the
view that, with the exception of the requirements for UNMEE, where the
additional resources are requested in connection with the relocation of the
headquarters to a more secure location, and UNFICYP, which is facing
unforeseen additional expenditure, additional requirements can be
accommodated within the overall budgets of peacekeeping missions, and
included in their performance reports. This recommendation would entail a



11

A/58/758

reduction of $2,782,500 in the proposed additional appropriation of
$11,959,400.

4. Infrastructure/premises for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda

28. An additional provision of $100,500 is requested for the one-time cost of
alteration and improvement of existing premises and security structures and the
acquisition of related materials and equipment (see A/58/756, para. 90). The
Advisory Committee recommends that this provision be accommodated within
the budget of the Tribunal and included in the performance report.

5. Responsibility and accountability

29. The Advisory Committee has repeatedly called for clear lines of
responsibility and accountability for all participants in field security and it
again emphasizes that requirement at this time. It points out that the
mechanism of accountability and responsibility now in place does not address
the relation between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the
Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator. The Committee recalls that it
requested that efforts should be made to clarify the relationship and interaction
between the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator and the Department
(see A/56/619, para. 9); the Committee also stressed that, in view of the importance
of a well-defined hierarchical security structure in the field, a prolonged discussion
on defining clear lines of responsibility and staff accountability in ensuring the
safety and security of staff would be unacceptable; the Committee called for the
issue to be addressed expeditiously (ibid., para. 11).

30. In response to General Assembly resolution 56/255, the Secretary-General
submitted a report on the framework for accountability for the United Nations field
security management system (A/57/365). During its review of that report, the
Committee enquired whether the Department of Peacekeeping Operations was
covered in the new mechanism of accountability and responsibility in the area of
field security and was informed that the Secretary-General would report on the issue
in the context of section VIII, paragraph 4, of General Assembly resolution 56/255,
in which the Secretary-General was requested to conduct an evaluation of the United
Nations security system, including the new security arrangements and the
relationship and interaction between the Department and the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator, and to report his findings and recommendations to the
Assembly at its fifty-eighth session; the Committee stressed the importance of the
evaluation and urged its completion as soon as possible (see A/57/7/Add.11, para.
5). When the Secretary-General submitted his progress report on inter-
organizational security measures (A/58/188), the Committee was informed that the
Secretariat was continuing to assess the findings and recommendations of the
independent evaluation called for under General Assembly resolution 56/255. The
Committee expects that the Secretary-General, in his further report on the
second phase of longer-term security measures, will set forth definitive
measures for cooperation between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
and the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator in the area of field
security.

6. Cost-sharing

31. As indicated in paragraph 20 of the Secretary-General’s report (A/58/756), a
proposal is made for the funding of the additional requirements of the Office of the
United Nations Security Coordinator entirely from the United Nations regular
budget, a policy change from the current security funding arrangement established
by the General Assembly in resolution 56/255.3 The Assembly established a system
of proportionate cost-sharing among United Nations organizations based on the size
of those organizations’ operations in the field. The rationale for the proposed change
is set out in paragraphs 98 and 99 of the report. The Advisory Committee points
out that the United Nations Secretariat and United Nations organizations,
funds and programmes share a common responsibility for the security and
safety of their staff and it is in their interest to provide adequate and assured
funding for security. The Committee is of the view that deficiencies in the
current funding arrangement should be addressed in the context of inter-
agency mechanisms for coordination and cooperation. The Committee
reiterates its belief in the importance of adhering to shared financial
responsibility in the coordinated management of the safety and security of
United Nations personnel (see A/56/619, para. 15). Under the circumstances,
the Committee recommends that requirements for the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator be adjusted to reflect the application of cost-
sharing; the United Nations share for objects of expenditure other than posts
would be $1.7 million, and the other participating organizations would be
responsible for $6.5 million. The Committee’s recommendations on posts in the
Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator are contained in paragraphs
11 to 13 above.

7. Future reporting

32. In paragraph 5 above, the Advisory Committee has made reference to the
“second phase” report that the Secretary-General intends to submit to the General
Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. This report is to represent a “comprehensive
global response” to the security situation which the Organization now faces. It is
imperative that the report of the Secretary-General set out a rational
framework for the enhancement of security arrangements, based on the
completion of all ongoing reviews, including the change management study.
The report would indicate definite time frames for the completion of the
various projects proposed as well as which organizational units are responsible
for their completion.

33. The Advisory Committee points out that security affects all components of
the United Nations system and not just the United Nations itself; irrespective of
location it is the activities of the United Nations system that, unfortunately,
have become potential targets. An integrated and coordinated approach by all
organizations of the United Nations system is therefore required. Accordingly,
the report should address security concerns for all activities and organizations
under the United Nations umbrella. The report should aim at the establishment
of a unified standard in terms of the level of security for each duty station,
including access to the public and for New York it should spell out the

implications for ongoing projects such as the capital master plan. It should
elaborate on the role and responsibility of the United Nations vis-à-vis host
countries in providing security to United Nations system premises and to field
operations. It should also set forth definitive measures for cooperation between
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator in the area of field security (see paras. 29 and 30
above).

34. The Advisory Committee also requests the Secretary-General, in his next
report, to discuss the use of modern surveillance technology, including the
impact of technological innovation on human resource requirements for
security and their configuration, as well as physical fitness and skill
requirements for security officers.

35. The report should be submitted early in the fifty-ninth session of the
General Assembly, so as to give sufficient time for proper analysis and
consideration by both the Advisory Committee and the General Assembly.

IV. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

36. Paragraph 103 of the Secretary-General’s report outlines the action to be taken
by the General Assembly. Taking into account its comments, observations and
recommendations in the paragraphs above, the Advisory Committee
recommends that the General Assembly appropriate the amount of $40 million
(gross) under the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 for the
implementation of the measures proposed by the Secretary-General to
strengthen the security and safety of United Nations operations, staff and
premises on an interim basis.

37. Furthermore, it should be noted that for peacekeeping operations and the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda the Committee has recommended
that, at this stage, expenses estimated at $4.9 million be accommodated within
the existing budgets ($4.3 million for peacekeeping operations and $0.6 million
for the Tribunal); such additional appropriations as may be necessary could be
considered in the context of the relevant performance reports. It should also be
noted that some $8.9 million of the provision for the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator recommended by the Committee would be borne
by the participating organizations under existing cost-sharing arrangements
(see para. 31 above).

38. The Advisory Committee cautions that any additional appropriation that
the General Assembly may wish to authorize in connection with the report of
the Secretary-General (A/58/756) should be used strictly for the purposes for
which the appropriation was authorized, that is, the security-related human
resources and projects indicated in the Secretary-General’s report.

V. Recapitulation

39. Compared with the request for $85,965,800 (including staff assessment)
submitted by the Secretary-General, the total resources which would be
