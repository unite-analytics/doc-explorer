Second regular session 2003

Item 7 of the provisional agenda
UNOPS: Financial, budgetary and administrative matters

Revised budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003,
budget estimates for the biennium 2004-2005 and
report on the level of the operational reserve
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations Office for
Project Services on the revised budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003,
budget estimates for the biennium 2004-2005 and on the level of the operational
reserve (DP/2003/38). The Committee also had before it, as background
documentation, the report of the UNDP Office of Audit and Performance and
Project Service Audit Section to the Executive Director of UNOPS on internal audit
services in 2002 (DP/2003/22) and the annual report of the Executive Director on
the activities of UNOPS in 2002 (DP/2003/19). During its consideration of these
matters, the Committee met with the Deputy Executive Director of UNOPS and his
colleagues, who provided additional information.

2. The Advisory Committee notes that the exceptional financial situation
confronting UNOPS in the last few years and the instability in its business
environment has required frequent adjustments to its budget projections. The
Committee has in the past commented on the serious situation facing the
management and operations of UNOPS (see DP/2002/34, paragraphs 2 to 6). The
Committee was informed that in response to the income shortfalls and operational
deficits faced by UNOPS during the biennium 2000-2001, in 2002 UNOPS
implemented a major organizational re-dimensioning exercise that led to drastic
cost-savings measures and significant revisions of its projected delivery and income.
Some of the consequences of this downsizing, resulting in the separation of 89 staff
(or 26 per cent of the total), have yet to be fully absorbed institutionally.

Revised estimates for 2002-2003

3. Revised delivery estimates for 2002-2003 amount to $969.5 million, based on
actual delivery of $485.1 million in 2002 and revised delivery projections of
$484.4 million for 2003 (see DP/2003/38, paragraph 8 and table 1). The Committee
was informed that the estimates are based on a rigorous and prudent delivery
projection exercise and on a new income forecasting methodology, which was first
introduced last year and refined further this year.

4. Revised total income estimates amount to $88.2 million for 2002-2003, based on
recorded income of $43.7 million in 2002 and revised projections of $44.5 million
for 2003 (see DP/2003/38, paragraph 9 and table 1). The Committee was informed
that with a total recurring administrative expenditure of $43.5 million in 2002,
UNOPS was able to adhere to its self-financing principle and even make a small but
symbolic contribution of $200 000 to the operational reserve. At the end of 2002 the
operational reserve stood at $4.2 million.

5. For 2003, the recurring administrative expenditure is estimated to amount to
$44.5 million. In addition, planned expenditure for 2003 includes $300 000 for
already approved remaining staff separations costs as well as $700 000 for part of
one-time investments in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Both these
charges are submitted as direct charges to the operational reserve (see DP/2003/38,
paragraph 15 and table 1). The Committee notes that UNOPS joined UNDP and
UNFPA in February 2003 in the implementation of the ERP system. UNOPS expects
to re-engineer its business processes and take advantage of the functionality of the
ERP system, for effective project management, improved information and data
sharing, enhanced financial reporting, and its accessibility from anywhere in the
world through Internet connection (DP/2003/38, paragraph 7).

6. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 30 June 2003, UNOPS has
recorded project delivery and income higher than projected in the revised estimates
for 2003, while maintaining the level of administrative expenditure in line with the
estimated budget. Recorded total project delivery amounts to $316 million (65 per
cent of the annual target), with total income and administrative expenditure
amounting to $25.0 million (56 per cent of the target) and $21.0 million (46 per cent
of the target), respectively.

Projections for 2004-2005

7. Projections of income and estimated expenditures for the biennium 2004-2005 are
discussed in paragraphs 30 to 34 of document DP/2003/38. The Advisory
Committee was informed that a review of the existing UNOPS portfolio for 2004
and beyond reveals that, at this stage, it does not yet have the required budgets that
would support an annual delivery of about $500 million, which would be
comparable to what was achieved in 2002 and likely to be realized in 2003. While
UNDP remains the main client of UNOPS, the UNDP portfolio has continued to
decline, from $1.5 billion in 1997 to $0.9 billion in 2002 (or about 40 per cent over
six years). Furthermore, increases in project portfolio from other organizations have
not been able to compensate for the significant decline in the UNDP portfolio. The
Committee was also informed that other factors significantly affecting the UNOPS

DP/2003/39

operations emanate from the increasingly shorter duration of the new contracts with
clients and from the political and economic problems occurring in some of the
countries where UNOPS has major operations, for example, in Iraq. Because of the
difficulty of making projections beyond a one-year horizon, in 2002 UNOPS
changed its planning and forecasting cycle from a two-year to a one-year cycle.

8. The Advisory Committee further notes that the UNOPS budget for 2004-2005 is
also expected to be influenced by the outcome of the ongoing independent review of
UNOPS that was commissioned by the Executive Board, with a view to formulating
a forward-looking strategy for the organization. The review is expected to be
finalized by the end of July 2003 (see DP/2003/38, paragraphs 8 and 33). The
Committee was informed that a new Executive Director of UNOPS has been
appointed and will assume his duties on 1 August 2003. The Executive Director
would be articulating his vision for the future of UNOPS and would take account of
any relevant recommendations from the independent review.

9. The Advisory Committee notes that, in the light of the above-mentioned factors,
UNOPS has deferred the detailed formulation of the estimates for the biennium
2004-2005 and instead proposes to use, at this time, the same level of project
delivery, income and expenditure as that estimated for the current biennium, while
committed to ensuring that its administrative costs would be fully covered by
income received.

10. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Executive Board approve the
revised budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003, the staffing level as proposed
for the biennium 2002-2003 and, taking into account the circumstances mentioned in
paragraph 8 above, the projections for 2004-2005.
