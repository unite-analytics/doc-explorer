Item 2 of the provisional agenda
Financial, budgetary and administrative matters

Budget estimates for the biennium 2006-2007
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions

I. Introduction

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
has considered the report of the Administrator on the UNDP budget estimates
for the biennium 2006-2007 (DP/2005/31). During its consideration of the
item, the Advisory Committee met with the Associate Administrator and other
representatives, who provided additional information and clarification.

Format and presentation

2. The Advisory Committee welcomes the changes in the presentation,
including the submission of an organizational chart indicating the number of
posts in each unit at headquarters and in the field (see annex 3, DP/2005/31),
and of action taken to reflect implementation of the recommendations made by
the Committee in its report on the support budget for 2004-2005 (DP/2003/29,
paragraphs 2 and 3), as approved by the Executive Board (see annex 4,
DP/2005/31).

3. The Committee believes that there is room for further improvement
in order to streamline the presentation, avoid repetition, and promote
greater clarity and transparency. In addition, in future, better
justification and rationale on proposals for new posts or reclassifications
should be provided in the related narratives.

4. It emerges from paragraph 85 of the budget document (DP/2005/31) that
UNDP, in close collaboration with UNFPA and UNICEF, intends to present an
aligned, results-based biennial support budget for 2008-2009.



2
DP/2005/32

5. The Committee recommends that the process of harmonization
towards implementing results-based budgeting for the next biennium,
2008-2009, be given high priority and trusts that UNDP, UNFPA and
UNICEF will take into account lessons learned by United Nations entities
that have already implemented results-based budgeting. In addition, the
existing knowledge of the United Nations Department of Management and
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations could be utilized in drawing
up such comprehensive framework. The submission of the budget
estimates for 2008-2009 will provide an opportunity to improve the
presentation.

6. The Committee notes that the proposed support budget for 2006-2007
continues to consolidate the operational and programmatic reforms undertaken
by UNDP, starting with the implementation of the 2002-2003 business plans
and the 2004-2007 multi-year funding framework (MYFF). The budget
proposals are guided by the four conceptual pillars of the MYFF listed in
paragraph 38 of the budget document. Specifically, the strategic priorities to
be supported in the budget are as follows:
(a) Strengthening UNDP leadership and central role in the United Nations

development and resident coordinator system (the reform agenda of the
Secretary-General being the prime driving force behind the proposed
budget);

(b) Enhancing organizational capacity, efficiency, performance,
accountability and results;

(c) Maximizing the use of available resources towards programme activities
by cost containment and improving the proportionate share between
regular and other resources of UNDP organizational capacities; and

(d) Commitment to support programme countries in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by strengthening advocacy and
outreach (see also DP/2005/31, paragraph 8).

7. The Committee was informed that the 2006-2007 budget is presented in
an overall financial context where both regular and other resources are steadily
growing. Total income for UNDP and its associated funds and programmes –
the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the United Nations
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the United Nations Volunteers
programme (UNV) – amounted to $4.1 billion in 2004. Regular resources
grew for the fourth consecutive year, reaching $842 million in 2004 (a
9.4 per cent increase over the level achieved in 2003). Other resources reached
almost $3 billion in 2004 (a 37 per cent increase over the level achieved in
2003). Exchange rate fluctuations also continued to have a positive effect
in 2004, accounting for the two thirds of overall regular resources increase,
with one third of the increase reflecting real growth.

8. The Committee notes from table 1 of the budget document (DP/2005/31)
that regular resources are estimated to increase from $1 700 million in 2004-
2005 to $1 900 million in 2006-2007, while contributions from other resources
(donor co-financing) are estimated to increase from $1 807 million in 2004-
2005 to $3 000 million for 2006-2007. The Committee also notes that other
resources provided by host Governments (i.e., Government cost sharing) are
likely to increase from $2 100 million in 2004-2005 to $2 600 million for



3
DP/2005/32

2006-2007. Thus, total overall contributions to UNDP are projected to increase
from $5 607 million in 2004-2005 to $7 500 million for 2006-2007.

9. The Committee trusts that UNDP will continue to accord priority
attention to its fundraising activities so as to increase resources available
for programmes.

10. It is evident from table 1 of the report on the resource plan of UNDP
(Use of resources – programme and support activities) that, for 2006-2007, the
expenditure on programmes is projected to be 70.7 per cent of the total regular
resources, as compared to 72.2 per cent for 2004-2005; the balance being
spent on management and administration and programme support costs related
to country offices and headquarters. In the case of other resources (donor co-
financing), the expenditure on programmes for 2006-2007 is estimated to be
93.5 per cent, as compared to 92.3 per cent for 2004-2005.

11. While the Committee notes that there has been some improvement in
channelling more funds to programmes in ‘other resources’, it is of the
opinion that further effort is needed to reduce expenditure on programme
support and administration and management in respect of regular
resources, so as to allocate more resources for programmes.

12. The proposed budget for 2006-2007 further advances the process,
initiated in the 2004-2005 budget, of rationalizing the funding modalities of
UNDP operational structures to align them with a multi-funded approach. The
process involves the identification of a base structure fully funded from
regular resources and funding all other requirements proportionally from
regular and other resources.

13. While the 2004-2005 budget introduced the base structure concept at
headquarters and in country offices, the 2006-2007 budget further reviews the
base structure of headquarters. Consequently, a total amount of $11.3 million
related to operational costs is shifted from regular to other resources
($9.9 million relates to headquarters, the balance of $1.4 million being shifted
to the country level) (paragraph 44, DP/2005/31).

14. The base structure for country offices is likely to be refined in 2006-2007
based on the outcome of discussions on strengthening country directors and
also on funding modality for deputy special representatives of the Secretary-
General. Therefore, the Administrator is recommending further refinement at
headquarters and at the country level in the context of 2008-2009 budget
proposals.

II. Biennial support budget for 2006-2007

15. As indicated in table 3 of document DP/2005/31, the proposed support
budget for 2006-2007 amounts to $729 million gross, reflecting an increase of
$95.4 million, as compared with support budget estimates for 2004-2005 of
$633.6 million. After applying the projected income of $71.2 million to the
gross appropriations, the net proposed support budget for 2006-2007 amounts
to $657.8 million, reflecting an increase of $94.5 million. This compares to net
support budget estimates for 2004-2005 of $563.3 million, based on a



4
DP/2005/32

projected income of $70.3 million to the support budget for the same period.
The main areas of increase/decrease are shown in table 2 and summarized in
paragraphs 35-37 of the budget document (DP/2005/31).

16. The Committee further notes that, with the exclusion of the support
budget requirements for UNCDF – which have been mainstreamed into UNDP
regular resources in accordance with the Executive Board decision 2005/5 (see
paragraph 21 below) – the budget presented would have constituted zero net
real growth. Cost increases, amounting to $86 million, are mainly due to
inflationary factors compounded by the weakening of the United States dollar.
As indicated in paragraph 20 of the budget document (DP/2005/31), total
investments of approximately $16 million, principally at the country level, are
funded from real reduction and funding redeployments. These are related to
the priority areas for 2006-2007 mentioned in paragraph 4 above, as well as to
initiatives embarked upon in 2004-2005 (see also paragraph 18, DP/2005/31).

17. As indicated in tables 4 and 5 of document DP/2005/31, the total number
of proposed posts for 2006-2007 is 3 286 (640 international professional,
615 national professional and 2 034 general service and other categories of
staff), taking into account the mainstreaming of 22 posts from UNCDF.

18. The proposed number of posts reflects a net reduction of 17 posts (an
increase of 23 international professional offset by a decrease of two national
professional and 38 general service and other categories of staff), as compared
with the 3 306 approved posts for 2004-2005 (617 international professional,
617 national professional and 2 072 general service and other categories of
staff).

19. For 2006-2007, 81.9 per cent of the total number of posts is proposed for
country offices; 11.6 per cent for headquarters; 5.7 per cent for UNV;
0.7 per cent for UNCDF and 0.1 per cent for the Inter-Agency Procurement
Services Office.

20. Information on proposed changes to regular budget post requirements
and reclassifications is provided in summary table 4 of the budget document
(DP/2005/31). The Committee has made comments in the past regarding the
upward reclassification of posts of funds and programmes, particularly at the
senior level. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that of the 22 posts
reclassified in the context of the 2004-2005 regular support budget at the D-1
and D-2 levels, only four were filled by promotion. The Committee was
provided with a consolidated list of 22 professional regular support budget
posts proposed for reclassification for 2006-2007 (see annex 1, below).

21. The Committee notes that UNDP is proposing net upward reclassification
of two senior-level international professional posts from the D-1 to the D-2
level in the Bureau for Development Policy (paragraph 70), and one net
downward reclassification from the D-1 to the P-5 level. The Committee
further notes that in line with the new job evaluation system in the common
system for professional and higher categories, new factors have been
introduced to reflect emerging organizational priorities (results, impact of
work and client orientation). Jobs are no longer evaluated on the basis of
processes and activities, but primarily by reference to their role within the
organization and the specific value they add to its programmes.



5
DP/2005/32

22. The Committee recommends that the Executive Board bear in mind
the earlier recommendation of the Advisory Committee that proposals for
upward reclassification of posts in funds and programmes of the United
Nations, particularly at the D-1 and D-2 levels, should be submitted only
as a result of significant changes in the level and scope of responsibilities
involved.

23. A list of the new international professional posts proposed for 2006-2007
was provided to the Committee (see annex 2, below).

24. Although the Committee recognizes that the staffing component
should be viewed in its totality, including the national staff component, the
Committee is of the opinion that efforts should be made to hire qualified,
skilled professional staff at the entry levels so as to ensure rejuvenation of
the organization.

25. An amount of $5.6 million is included in the support budget in order to
strengthen the resident coordinator system. At the country level, UNDP is
proposing to appoint country directors to run the day-to-day programmes,
giving more freedom to the resident coordinator to play the significant role
required in a number of UNDP offices (paragraphs 55 and 108, DP/2005/31).

26. At headquarters, the United Nations Development Group Office would
be strengthened by increasing staffing by one international professional and
one support staff (from 10 posts to 12), to be funded from regular resources
(ibid, paragraph 105). The costs associated with this initiative amount to
$57 million, covering the period from July 2005 to December 2007, as
indicated by the Administrator in his letter to the Executive Board dated
8 February 2005.

27. However, the Committee notes that the Administrator has requested the
support of donors to fund 40 country directors from extrabudgetary resources,
while UNDP would fund seven of these posts from regular resources that were
included in the 2006-2007 budget estimates ($4.5 million). The entire cost
would be mainstreamed into the 2008-2009 budget.

28. Paragraph 112 indicates that agreement is being finalized to adopt a cost-
sharing formula to be used by UNDP and the United Nations Department of
Peacekeeping Operations in cases where the resident coordinator also acts as
the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and that full
implementation may result in further cost implications. Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that agreement had been reached on a 50/50 funding
modality of such posts by both entities, and that the terms of reference were
being drafted. A memorandum of understanding would be signed shortly.

29. The Committee notes that the integrated mission operation has not yet
been achieved.

30. The Committee trusts that UNDP and the Department of Peace-
keeping Operations will enhance cooperation and coordination at the field
level so as to avoid fragmented functionalities at the country level where
peacekeeping missions operate. It is the opinion of the Committee that
cooperation and coordination should also be effective and enhanced at the
managerial and operational levels at headquarters.



6
DP/2005/32

31. In line with the strategy for 2006-2007 outlined in paragraph 4 above, an
amount of $4.0 million is proposed in order to strengthen advocacy and
outreach activities at the country and regional levels in order to promote better
understanding of the MDGs.

32. The Committee notes that the resources proposed in the budget document
cover seven international regional advisors and related operating expenses (see
paragraphs 59-60, DP/2005/31). As to the initiatives and further investments
towards enhancing organizational capacity, efficiency, performance,
accountability and results, the Committee notes the consolidation of capacity
into regional centers, allowing better service to country offices. A provision of
$2.2 million for a global payroll function should allow country offices to shift
related functions and achieve efficiency gains (ibid, paragraph 86). Provision
of $1.1 million is also included to reform and strengthen the internal justice
and grievance system in UNDP (see paragraphs 18 and 81, DP/2005/31).

33. The support budget provides for further implementation of the core
modules of Atlas, with additional modules to be phased in as part of the
wave II rollout; additional investment of $1.9 million from regular resources
over the base in information and communications technology budget is
indicated in paragraph 18.

34. In that connection, the Committee notes that the resources for
information and communications technology-related costs amount to
$42.2 million for 2006-2007 (see table 8, DP/2005/31), including an amount
of $1.9 million for systems development and engineering and $26 million for
maintenance services, including maintenance of the services not yet replaced
by Atlas.

35. Given the fact that considerable expenditure has been incurred on
state-of-the-art technology, the Committee expects to see tangible results
in efficiency gains and savings related to both post and non-post
resources.

36. Table 12 of the budget document presents the consolidated security
budget for UNDP for 2006-2007, which amounts to $55.7 million, reflecting
an increase of $25.3 million compared to the appropriations approved for
2004-2005. These are broken up into three sections. first, the United Nations-
mandated security costs, which amount to $41.2 million gross, emanating from
the decisions contained in the relevant General Assembly resolutions
regarding the UNDP share of United Nations security costs.

37. UNDP, in agreement with UNFPA, has decided to move these costs out
of the budget and present them as a distinct requirement so as not to distort the
budget with costs that are not necessarily operational in nature. However (as
indicated in paragraph 137 of the budget document), in line with the gradual
proportionality strategy, an estimated $10 million of the requirements will be
covered by other resources funding, thus reflecting the balance of
$31.2 million in a distinct line, as a separate requirement from regular
resources outside the support budget.

38. Second, direct security costs – which continue to be an integral part of
the support budget – amount to $14.4 million, reflecting an increase of
$7.5 million over the 2004-2005 related resources, as shown in table 12 and



7
DP/2005/32

explained in paragraph 138 of the budget document (DP/2005/31). Third, the
special security reserve, which included a provision of up to $11.5 million
under the 2004-2005 budget, after the Baghdad attack, is to be discontinued
for 2006-2007.

39. In this connection, the Advisory Committee points to the comments
on the need for integration, coordination, and rationalization of the
security management system in order to avoid previous duplications of
security structures (see the Advisory Committee report on the
strengthened and unified security management system for the
United Nations, A/59/539).

III. The United Nations Capital Development Fund

40. As indicated in paragraph 10 above, the administrative costs of UNCDF
have been mainstreamed into the UNDP biennial support budget for 2006-
2007 and are reported therein, as called for in Executive Board decisions
DP/2005/5 and DP/2005/22.

41. The support budget for UNCDF is built on these decisions and on the
business plans for 2005-2007 (DP/2005/22). Information is provided in
paragraphs 120-126 of the budget document (DP/2005/31). As indicated in
paragraph 121, UNCDF undertook a change management process and revised
its organizational structure and staffing arrangements in order to position itself
adequately for delivering on its mandate.

42. Moreover, the 2004-2005 resource plan was revised to better reflect
current levels of planned contributions and uses of programme resources for
regular and other resources. Thus, planned contributions were reduced from
$60 million to $35 million (42 per cent) and planned use of programme
resources revised from $50 million to $30 million (40 per cent).

43. As shown in table 10, the UNCDF biennial support budget for 2006-2007
amounts to $10 million, compared to $14.4 million in 2004-2005. The total
number of positions decreased from 32 posts to 22.

IV. The United Nations Development Fund for Women

44. The budget estimates of UNIFEM have been harmonized with those of
UNDP, using the same terminology and methodology as that of the UNDP
support budget. The resource plan is shown in table13 of the budget report.

45. The Committee notes that income projection for 2006-2007, for both
regular and other resources, amount to $104.1 million compared to an income
level of $83.3 million for 2004-2005. Regular resources, as shown in table 13,
are projected to increase by 15 per cent compared to 2004-2005.

46. The proposed biennial support budget for UNIFEM for 2006-2007
amounts to $16.4 million, or 28.9 per cent of its income projection for regular
resources for 2006-2007 of $56.8 million, funding 37 positions. It reflects an



8
DP/2005/32

increase of 10.1 per cent compared to the 2004-2005 support budget, which
amounts to $14.9 million, or 30.2 percent of the income projected for regular
resources of $49.4 million; funding 36 positions (see also summary tables
7 (a) and 7 (b), DP/2005/31).

47. It is evident from table 13 of the UNIFEM resource plan (Use of
resources – programme and support activities) that expenditure on
programmes for 2006-2007 is projected to be 72.6 per cent of the total regular
resources, as compared to 73 per cent in 2004-2005; the balance being spent
on management and administration and programme support costs. In the case
of other resources, the expenditure for 2006-2007 is estimated to be
92 per cent on programmes, as compared to 90 per cent for 2004-2005.

48. While the Committee notes that there has been some improvement in
channelling more funds to programmes in other resources, it is of the
opinion that more effort is needed to reduce expenditure on programme
support and administration and management in respect of regular
resources so as to increase resources available for programmes.
