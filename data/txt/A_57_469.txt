Human resources management

Human resources management reform, monitoring capacity
in the Office of Human Resources Management, consultants
and individual contractors, and employment of retired
former staff

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the reports of the Secretary-General on consultants and individual
contractors (A/57/310), on employment of retired former staff (A/57/413), on
monitoring capacity in the Office of Human Resources Management (A/57/276) and
on human resources management reform (A/57/293). During its consideration of the
reports, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General,
who provided additional information.

Consultants and individual contractors

2. The report of the Secretary-General on consultants and individual contractors
for the year 2001 (A/57/310) is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution
53/221 of 7 April 1999. The Advisory Committee welcomes the report and notes
that the information and analysis contained therein would permit the Committee and
the General Assembly to monitor this type of personnel services, which normally is
not clearly explained in the United Nations proposed programme budgets. The
Committee notes that during the reporting period, the Integrated Management
Information System (IMIS) was still being installed in certain offices away from
Headquarters and it was not possible to present IMIS-based information on a
worldwide basis. The report therefore was issued with some delay and includes data
from legacy systems for the earlier part of 2001 and from IMIS for the latter part of
the reporting period (A/57/310, para. 2). The Committee trusts that for 2002, with
the installation of IMIS in offices away from Headquarters, the problem will
not recur and the report will be issued at a much earlier date. The Committee
intends to use the content of the report for 2002 during its examination of the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. In this connection,



2
A/57/469

the Committee expects that programme managers will be informed and able to
justify their own requirements for consultants and individual contractors.

3. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraphs 5 to 7 and table 1 of the report
that the number of consultants and individual contractors increased in 2001, as
compared with recalibrated data for 2000. The Committee was provided with data
for 2000 on contracts with consultants and individual contractors, as compared with
2001, as follows (see also annexes I and II to the present report):

2000 2001

Contracts with consultants (number of persons) 3 054 3 300

Contracts with individual contractors (number of persons) 1 314 1 497

Total consultants and individual contractors 4 368 4 797

Contracts with consultants (number of contracts) 4 173 4 204

Contracts with individual contractors (number of contracts) 2 471 2 939

Total number of contracts 6 644 7 143

Contracts with consultants (fees in $ million) $33.1 $36.6

Contracts with individual contractors (fees in $ million) 8.8 10.3

Total fees ($ million) $41.9 $46.9

4. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 9 and table 3 of the report that
48.5 per cent of the total number of contracts issued in 2001 were for administrative
services (20.2 per cent for consultants and 28.3 per cent for individual contractors),
while a very limited number of contracts were issued in 2001 for substantive
programme activities in the budget (0.8 per cent for programme planning, 1.2 per
cent for programme evaluation, 5.2 per cent for analytical studies and 9.2 per cent
for programme implementation). In the view of the Committee, the number of
contracts issued for administrative services is excessive as compared with those
issued for substantive programme areas. There is a need to review this matter
carefully.

5. Table 2 of the annex to the report provides a breakdown of consultants and
individual contractors by nationality in 2001. Although consultants were engaged
from 156 countries, 19 countries accounted for 51.8 per cent of all consultants;
individual contractors came from 116 countries, although 11 countries accounted for
66.5 per cent of all individual contractors. The Advisory Committee notes that more
than 50 per cent of the persons engaged in 2001 were from developed countries. The
Committee requests that the matter be reviewed with a view to engaging more
consultants and individual contractors from developing countries and from
countries with economies in transition.

6. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 10 and table 4 of the report
that the largest occupational group for individual contractors in 2001 is translators
and revisers (256 persons). It further notes that a large number of contracts for
consultants and individual contractors issued in 2001 under the occupational group
“support related to professional, managerial and technical occupation” were for
many clerical and administrative support services, including secretarial support (109
persons), typing (47 persons), text processing (7 persons), messenger services (26
persons) and filing (1 person). The foregoing statistics point to a potential



3
A/57/469

problem in the use of special service agreements. The Committee intends to
follow up on this in the context of its consideration of the proposed programme
budget for the biennium 2004-2005.

Employment of retired former staff

7. The report of the Secretary-General is submitted pursuant to General Assembly
decision 51/408 of 4 November 1996, requesting the Secretary-General to report
every two years on all aspects of the use of retired former staff. The report includes
information for the biennium 2000-2001 on the possible revision of the ceiling on
annual earnings of retirees and provides information concerning retired former staff
recruited on a short-term basis. As requested by the Committee (A/53/691, para. 10),
the report also includes statistics on persons who have retired after age 60 or 62 but
have been re-employed for a period for six months or more.

8. In its decision 51/408, the General Assembly decided to set a ceiling across the
board of $22,000 per calendar year, representing an amount updated from the
$12,000 limit set by the Assembly in 1982, for the employment of retired staff in
receipt of a pension benefit from the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, with
the exception of language-services staff, for whom the ceiling will be $40,000 per
calendar year, and to limit such employment to no more than six months per
calendar year.

9. As indicated in paragraph 9 of the Secretary-General’s report, when the
General Assembly adopted its decision 51/408, the daily rate for freelance
interpreters in New York was $355, which made possible the employment of
freelance interpreters for up to 112 days (or six months). Because of cost-of-living
adjustments, the current daily rate for interpreters is now $391.50, which makes
possible the employment of freelance interpreters for only up to 102 days before
reaching the ceiling of $40,000 per calendar year. For the reasons explained in
paragraphs 8 to 10 of the report, it is proposed that to meet the requirements of
language staff of the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference
Services (currently the Department for General Assembly and Conference
Management), retired freelance language staff be allowed to work for up to 125
workdays per calendar year, which would be equivalent, at the current daily rate of
$391.50, to the amount of $48,937.50 per calendar year. The Advisory Committee
was informed that the number of workdays proposed represents one half of the 250
workdays available in the calendar year.

10. The Advisory Committee concurs in the proposal of the Secretary-General
to set the maximum limit on the employment of retired language staff in terms
of workdays rather than as a dollar amount. The Advisory Committee
therefore recommends that the maximum limit be set at 125 workdays per year.
In so doing, it will not be necessary in the future to consider frequent revisions
to the limit in order to accommodate cost-of-living adjustments to the daily
rate.

11. The Advisory Committee welcomes the statistics and analysis provided in part
III of the report for the biennium 2002-2001. The Committee recommends that, in
future, a trend analysis be included in the report, with corresponding statistical
data shown in the tables of the annex to the report for the last biennium.
Moreover, the pay or grade of the retirees should be explained more clearly in
the tables.

A/57/469

12. The Advisory Committee notes that, within the breakdown of the use of retired
former staff by department or office, language services in the Department of General
Assembly Affairs and Conference Services accounted for 26.2 per cent of the
engagement, making the Department the single largest user of retired staff
(A/57/413, para. 12). The Committee understands that retired former language staff
have been recruited from a limited number of countries. The Committee requests
that, in future, the breakdown by nationality and gender (see A/57/413, para.
13, and annex, table 4) also show the language staff component separately. The
Committee believes that a greater effort should be made to recruit retired
former language staff from a wider geographical area and, wherever feasible,
to use them in a remote role, rather than run the additional expense of bringing
them to a United Nations centre, bearing in mind the need for adequate
resources for in-house revision.

13. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 18 of the report that the use of
retired former staff in language services decreased in the biennium 2000-2001 in the
number of engagements, number of days worked and fees and salaries, as compared
with the biennium 1998-1999, while in administrative services, the use of retired
former staff increased in 2000-2001 in the number of engagements, number of days
worked and total cost, as compared with the biennium 1998-1999. The Committee
requests that in future the reasons for these changes be explained.

14. The Advisory Committee recalls that whenever a vacancy occurs, there is no
dearth of new applicants. For example, in table A.27C.10 of the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003, for the biennium 2000-2001,
50,000 applications were projected for 720 vacancies at the Professional level and
higher and for the biennium 2002-2003, 70,000 applications were projected for 700
vacancies. The Committee reiterates its view that programme managers should
not use their inability to plan for vacancies and process applications in a timely
manner as an excuse to engage retired personnel (see A/56/7, para. 135).

Monitoring capacity in the Office of Human Resources Management

15. The report of the Secretary-General is submitted pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001. The report outlines a plan to build increased
capacity in the Office of Human Resources Management to improve its effectiveness
in monitoring all relevant activities in the Secretariat regardless of the source of
funding. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 20 of the report that it is
the intention of the Secretary-General to continue current monitoring activities
within the constraints of available resources and to adjust resources to new functions
so as to develop organizational capacity to fully meet the goal of achieving the
comprehensive approach for monitoring described in the report. The Committee
intends to revert to this matter in the context of its review of the Secretary-
General’s proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005.

Human resources management reform

16. The report of the Secretary-General is submitted pursuant to General Assembly
resolution 55/258 on human resources management and its decision 56/462 on
young professionals. The report outlines the progress achieved and planned future
activities in each of the major initiatives for reform submitted by the Secretary-



5
A/57/469

General in his report of 1 August 2000 on human resources management reform
(A/55/253).

17. The Advisory Committee notes that the information on achievements reported
to date on the major initiatives of the human resources management reform
(A/57/293, section III) and other specific issues which are cross-cutting in nature
(A/57/293, section IV) cover the experience of the Secretariat for a rather short
period. In the Committee’s opinion, the Secretary-General should report in a
comprehensive manner on the achievements of the human resources
management reform when sufficient information is available on the experiences
of the Secretariat with the implementation of the reform initiatives as
implemented within the prerogative of the Secretary-General or as approved by
the General Assembly. The report, which should cover relevant activities of the
Secretariat regardless of the source of funding, should be submitted to the
Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.

18. The Advisory Committee was informed of the intention of the Secretariat to
streamline further the reports of the Secretary-General on human resources
management, including via publication of more data on the Intranet. The
Committee trusts that such streamlining will take into account the Committee’s
previously stressed concern for the need to report in an analytical manner,
providing sufficient statistical data in support of the analyses and conclusions
in the reports.
