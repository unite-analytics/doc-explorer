Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the
Secretary-General on the financial performance of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of
Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious
Violations of International Humanitarian Law
Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan
Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such
Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring
States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 for
the period from 1 January to 31 December 2000
(A/56/500) and on the proposed budget for the Tribunal
for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/497 and Add.1).
During its consideration of the reports, the Advisory
Committee met with the Registrar and the Acting

Policy Coordinator in the Office of the Prosecutor, as
well as with other representatives of the Tribunal and
of the Secretary-General, who provided additional
information.

Financial performance report for
the period from 1 January to
31 December 2000

2. As indicated in the table in section II of the
financial performance report (A/56/500), a total of
$86,154,900 gross ($78,170,200 net) was appropriated
by the General Assembly for the Tribunal for the
period from 1 January to 31 December 2000. The



2
A/56/666

recorded expenditure for the period amounted to
$83,144,800 gross ($75,817,300 net), leaving an
unencumbered balance of $3,010,100 gross
($2,352,900 net).

3. With regard to the presentation of the
financial performance report, the Advisory
Committee requests that the reports be restructured
in future. The format and content of the report
should follow those of the budget estimates for the
Tribunal and should include programme
performance information. The summary table
should be accompanied by tables on appropriation
and expenditure for each of the three organs of the
Tribunal by object of expenditure. In addition, the
report should indicate performance in terms of the
benchmarks used to estimate requirements. For
example, where work-months and number of
missions are used as the basis for estimating
resource requirements under non-staff and travel
costs, the performance report should indicate
performance in work-months and number of
missions. In view of the fact that the budget is now
submitted biennially, the financial and programme
performance report should be submitted annually.

4. The Advisory Committee notes the decrease of
$5,106,300, or 9.36 per cent, in relation to the
appropriation of $54,554,900 under posts, reflecting
the high vacancy rate experienced by the Tribunal
during the period. As indicated in paragraph 2 of the
report, the vacancy factors used in the budget estimates
were 19 per cent for Professional staff and 13 per cent
for General Service and related categories of staff for
continuing posts, and 60 per cent and 50 per cent
respectively for new posts. The actual average vacancy
rates for the period were 22.5 per cent for Professional
staff and 13.3 per cent for General Service staff. The
Advisory Committee exchanged views on this issue
with the Registrar, who indicated that innovative
measures were needed to attract and retain staff. Upon
request, the Committee was provided with additional
information concerning incentives that were under
consideration (see para. 17 below).

5. The performance indicators contained in the
annex to the financial performance report indicate
significant underperformance in relation to projections
in a number of work areas of the Tribunal. In the Office
of the Prosecutor, for example, of the four trials
expected to be completed in 2000, only two were
completed. Of the 20 projected arrests, 5 were carried

out. In the Witnesses and Victims Support Section,
considerable underperformance is evident in nearly
every area. For example, of the total projected
workload of 3,367 tasks, only 1,406, or 41.8 per cent,
were completed.

6. The performance situation has improved,
however. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was
provided with an update of annex IV to the budget
estimates for the Tribunal for the biennium 2002-2003
(A/56/497/Add.1) showing estimated and actual
workload completed for 2001 as at 31 October 2001.
According to the update, 68 per cent of the projected
workload of the Witnesses and Victims Support Section
for both the prosecution and the defence for 2001 had
been completed as at 31 October, the bulk of it for the
prosecution. The Committee also notes from the update
that 58 per cent of the projected workload of the Office
of the Prosecutor for 2001 had been completed as at 31
October. In this connection, the Committee notes, as
indicated in the budget estimates, that the pace of work
of the Tribunal has accelerated and the number of
accused on trial has increased in 2001 to a total of 17
(A/56/497, para. 6). The Committee has taken some of
these performance results into account in formulating
its recommendations in the paragraphs below.

7. The financial performance report shows an
overexpenditure of $3,849,400 in relation to the
appropriation of $7,400,000 under contractual services
(A/56/500, para. 8), including defence counsel costs of
$2,070,100 for fee claims for 1999 and $827,200 for
partial payments for 2000. Upon enquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the overexpenditure for
defence counsel costs was due largely to poor
monitoring and claims processing and that the
projected expenditure for 2001 for such costs as at 30
September 2001 amounted to $7,256,400.

Proposed budget for the biennium
2002-2003

8. Paragraphs 1 to 18 of the report on the budget
estimates of the Tribunal for the biennium 2002-2003
(A/56/497) describe the developments that have
affected the operation of the Tribunal. Chief among
these is the accelerated pace of trials (ibid., paras. 5-6).
The Advisory Committee welcomes this development.

9. The Advisory Committee was provided with
information and statistics as at 21 November 2001 on



3
A/56/666

the completion of eight trials since 1997 involving nine
accused persons. One case was withdrawn and is
subject to a hearing by the Appeals Chamber; seven of
the convicted lodged appeals, five of which have been
settled by the Appeals Chamber and two of which are
pending; and there was one acquittal of an accused
person in 2001 that is currently before the Appeals
Chamber. As stated above, there are at present 7
ongoing trials involving 17 accused persons. In
addition, approximately 9 cases involving 27 indicted
persons are in the pre-trial stage. Twenty-one arrest
warrants have been issued against accused persons who
remain at large.

10. The Advisory Committee welcomes the fact that
a management review of the Tribunal has been
undertaken by the Department of Management (see
A/56/497, para. 16). Upon enquiry, the Committee was
informed that a number of the recommendations
resulting from the review had already been
implemented and that resources to implement others
had been included in the estimates. The Committee
requested details concerning the resources included in
the estimates for that purpose (see annex I).

11. The Advisory Committee notes that the Tribunal
has implemented a number of measures intended to
control and monitor more closely the legal aid regime
and defence counsel costs (see ibid., paras. 15-16).
However, in the opinion of the Committee, the results
of the implementation of these measures are not as yet
apparent (see also para. 44 below).

12. The important question of long-term planning for
the enforcement of sentences, which was highlighted
by the Advisory Committee in its report to the General
Assembly at its fifty-fifth session (A/55/643, para. 63),
is still pending. The Committee had requested that a
report on that issue be submitted to the General
Assembly; the Assembly endorsed the request in
paragraph 9 of its resolution 55/226 of 23 December
2000. The Committee understands that the Secretary-
General will submit the report to the Assembly in the
spring of 2002. The Committee reiterates its concern
on this issue and regrets the delay in submission of
the report. In connection with the enforcement of
sentences, the Committee was informed that, following
a ruling by the Office of Legal Affairs, the $250,000
appropriated for this purpose for 2001 had not been
fully utilized (see paras. 47-49 below).

13. The overall level of resources proposed for the
Tribunal for the biennium 2002-2003 (in its first
biennial submission) amounts to $204,407,900 gross
($186,998,500 net), reflecting an increase before
recosting of $24,278,200 gross ($23,025,100 net), or
13.4 per cent, over the 2000-2001 appropriation. After
recosting, the estimate is $198,523,800 gross
($179,015,300 net), reflecting the impact of provision
for inflation of $26,690,500, which is offset by the
combined impact of reductions due to favourable
exchange rates ($29,621,900), salary standard cost
changes ($2,952,700) and increased income from staff
assessment ($2,099,100) (A/56/497, para. 19, and
A/56/497/Add.1, annex I).

14. Extrabudgetary resources projected for the period
amount to $3,079,900 (A/56/497, table 3). The
Advisory Committee notes that only two Member
States had contributed or pledged to contribute to the
Voluntary Fund for the Tribunal in 1999 and 2000 (see
A/56/497/Add.1, annex VII, para. 3). The Committee
was informed that fund-raising efforts were being
intensified. Upon enquiry, representatives of the
Tribunal informed the Committee that some
extrabudgetary funds were tied; an amount of $200,000
was cited as having been earmarked by a donor for
investigation.

15. The proposed staffing table for the biennium
2002-2003 comprises 973 posts, reflecting an increase
of 101 posts (6 for the Office of the Prosecutor and 95
for the Registry), 6 of which are to be converted from
general temporary assistance funds. Of the 95 new
posts proposed for the Registry, 60 are for judicial
support and 35 are for administrative support and
language services. In addition, five reclassifications are
proposed (4 upward and 1 downward).

16. The Advisory Committee notes that high vacancy
rates continue to plague the Tribunal (ibid., annex III).
Vacancy rates in the Professional category ranged from
27.8 per cent to 20.3 per cent for the months of January
to October 2001. In the General Service and related
categories, the rate ranged from 16.4 to 10.3 per cent.
The Committee reiterates its view that it is not
possible to accurately determine requirements for
additional personnel in the Tribunal until vacancies
are considerably reduced (see A/54/646, paras. 22
and 55). The Committee notes that in the estimates for
2002-2003, vacancy factors of 20 per cent and 10 per
cent respectively were used for Professional and
General Service staff, with the proviso that should the



4
A/56/666

efforts being made by the Tribunal result in a higher
rate of post encumbrance, the General Assembly would
be informed accordingly (see A/56/497, para. 69). The
Committee agrees with this procedure.

17. On the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee (A/55/643, para. 18), the Tribunal has
instituted two-year contracts for staff members. The
Committee notes that while this has, as yet, had little
effect on the vacancy situation, it has improved
planning and enhanced the efficiency of human
resources management (see A/56/497, para. 17). The
Committee was briefed on a number of initiatives to
improve conditions of service. It was informed,
however, that no decision had been taken on them. The
Committee observes that any such initiative should
be considered within the framework of the salaries
and allowances in the United Nations common
system, and urges neighbouring United Nations
headquarters to offer any assistance possible.

18. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in the
context of its consideration of the proposed budget for
the Tribunal for 2001, it was informed that the nature
of investigation had changed; all targets had been
identified, and the priority was the investigation of fact
and the indictment, tracking and arrest of suspects. The
Committee understands that the functions of the Kigali
office are now mainly concerned with tracking.
Accordingly, the Committee had expected a clearer
indication in the budget estimates of the results of a
rigorous review of the administrative and support
services and related expenditures of the Kigali
office, as well as an indication as to whether the
proposals for the transfer of posts involving Kigali
were the result of the review. The Committee
requests that such information be included in the
next budget estimates.

19. The separate request for ad litem judges,
mentioned in paragraph 6 of the report, if approved,
will affect the estimates. Upon enquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the matter was currently
before the Security Council and that a decision was
expected some time in December. The Committee will
take up any requests for additional resources after the
Council has taken a decision on the question.

20. The Advisory Committee notes that the
Prosecutor has not set a target date for the conclusion
of first instance trials, as she has done for the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It is

clear, however, that if the last indictments are to be
presented at the end of 2005, as projected by the
Prosecutor (see para. 27 below), the related arrests and
trials would take some time beyond that date. Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that after arrest
the average period of detention before an accused was
brought to trial was 2 years, 9 months, and that the
average trial length was 12 to 18 months. The
Committee was also informed that the average length
of trials in the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia was 12 months.

21. On the basis of testimony and information
provided, it is the view of the Advisory Committee
that there does not appear to be a firm, realistically
achievable exit strategy for the completion of the
work of the Tribunal. In this connection, the
Committee recalls its report on the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to the General
Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, in which it
commented that a realistic assessment should be
made of the steps and measures needed to meet
stated goals and, further, that it was difficult to
focus on a specific date to complete the mandate of
the Tribunal until it was known when investigations
would be completed and what the final number of
detainees awaiting trial would be (see A/55/642,
para. 12).

The Chambers

22. The Advisory Committee requests that, in
future, the section of the budget report dealing with
the Chambers contain information similar to that of
the report of the International Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia (see A/56/495, para. 13).

23. The Advisory Committee enquired about
courtroom usage, as well as about travel and
extrajudicial activities that required judges to be away
from Arusha. With regard to travel, the Committee
recalls its comment in its report to the General
Assembly at its fifty-fifth session that the frequent
absence of judges affects the speedy commencement or
completion of trials in which the travelling judges are
involved and its view that judicial activities,
particularly those of the President, should take
precedence over public relations activities and
attendance at external meetings (see A/55/643, para.
27). The information provided to the Committee
indicated that judges now spend much more time in



5
A/56/666

Arusha than previously. The Committee welcomes
this development (see also para. 24 below).

24. With respect to courtroom usage, the Advisory
Committee notes that 442 courtroom days were
projected for 2000, of which 237 were realized (see
A/56/500, annex). For 2001, the projection was for 450
courtroom days, 286 of which had been realized as at 6
November, according to information provided to the
Committee. The estimate for 2002-2003 is for 1,300
days, or 650 days per year. The Committee considers
the courtroom usage to be somewhat low and trusts
that as the pace of trials and other judicial activities
increases, the level of productivity will also rise. In
this regard, the Committee welcomes the
information that, in the courtroom, the judges now
work for longer hours and that their court
workweek has been increased from four days to
five. The Committee requests that similar
information be provided for the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

25. With regard to the use of the “twin-tracking”
method to schedule two or three trials in each of the
three chambers, the Advisory Committee points out
that this practice means that a large number of defence
and prosecution personnel is required to be available to
be called in chambers at all times. If all three chambers
operate simultaneously, the logistical problems and
expenditures could be quite considerable, and if
scheduling is not done effectively, the attempt to save
time may instead lead to further delays and additional
costs. The Committee requests that a review be
made of the twin-tracking method of scheduling
multiple trials in each of the three chambers with a
view to ascertaining whether the method is indeed
cost-effective.

Office of the Prosecutor

26. The estimate for the Office of the Prosecutor for
the biennium 2002-2003 amounts to $49,824,000 gross
($44,202,000 net) before recosting, reflecting an
increase of $3,185,400 gross ($2,994,900 net), or 6.8
per cent, over the appropriation for 2000-2001. The
estimates include a request for six additional Local
level posts in Kigali for language assistants, the
redeployment from Kigali to Arusha of two P-4 legal
advisers and four Professional and five General Service
staff in the Information and Evidence Support Section
and the reclassification of the Commander of the

Investigations Division from P-4 to P-5
(A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV, paras. 8-10 and 16-18).
The Advisory Committee found the presentation of
the estimates and objectives for this Office to be
clearly formulated.

27. The Advisory Committee notes from the
information before it that the Office of the Prosecutor
plans to undertake and complete up to 136 new
investigations and related indictments by the end of
2005 as follows: 29 by the end of 2001, 30 each for the
years 2002 to 2004 and 17 in 2005 (see A/56/351-
S/2001/863 and Corr.1, para. 120). The Committee
notes that the Prosecutor’s strategy is to complete all
new investigations by the end of 2004 and to present
the last indictments by the end of 2005 (see A/56/497,
para. 35). To accomplish that goal, the Tribunal would
need to resort to the use of ad litem judges. The
strategy involves six trials running concurrently to be
twin-tracked in each of the three trial chambers. In this
connection, the Committee points out that it cannot be
known how many indictments or trials will result from
the new investigations; however, the Committee notes
the estimate of up to 55 indictments and 20 arrests for
the biennium (see A/56/497, para. 41 (a)). The
Committee was informed that of the seven trials
currently under way, four were to be completed in 2002
and three in 2003.

28. The Advisory Committee was informed that as at
31 October, 35 posts in the Office of the Prosecutor
were vacant, including one D-2 and one D-1. The
Committee notes that the D-2 post is that of the Deputy
Prosecutor in Kigali and the D-1 post is that of the
Chief of Prosecution in Arusha. The Committee
understands that these two important posts have been
vacant for quite awhile — more than a year for the
Chief of Prosecution and since May for the Deputy
Prosecutor. At present, there is no indication as to
when those posts will be filled. The Committee
understands that for the time being the Office of the
Prosecutor in Kigali is represented by the resident
Chief of Investigations.

29. The Advisory Committee is very concerned
about the impact this situation has on the
effectiveness of the prosecutorial and investigative
activities of the Tribunal. The situation not only
stalls the full implementation of the vital work of
the Office of the Prosecutor, it also leads to costly
expenditures by the Prosecutor and accompanying
staff for travel to and from Arusha, Kigali and The



6
A/56/666

Hague. The Committee is of the view that
immediate steps should be taken, with the assistance
of Headquarters, to fill those positions without
further delay. Furthermore, in order to ensure the
rapid filling of posts, flexibility should be granted in
implementing recruitment procedures, particularly
as regards the length of time for which vacancies
must be posted. The Committee points out that the
longer the high rate of vacancies persists in the
Tribunal, the greater the potential for larger future
expenditures by Member States due to the longer
period of time that the Tribunal would take to
complete investigations and carry out subsequent
trials.

30. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in the
budget estimates for the Tribunal for 2001, the
Secretary-General had proposed a new Prosecution
Appeals Section in Arusha (see A/55/512 and Corr.1,
annex II, paras. 25 and 26). Four posts (1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1
P-2 and 1 Local level) were approved by the General
Assembly for the Section. The P-5 post for the senior
appeals attorney was transferred from The Hague. The
reason given for establishing the Section in Arusha was
that it was envisaged that the majority of the Tribunal’s
appeal cases would be heard in Arusha and that the
repository of Tribunal trial documents would be
located in Arusha (ibid., para. 25). Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that the posts were still
vacant but were under recruitment, and that the
Prosecutor was proposing the redeployment of all
except the P-2 post and the Local level post to The
Hague, although there is no mention of the proposed
redeployments in the budget. No reason was given for
this proposal. The Committee has serious
reservations about what appears to be an arbitrary
decision that may adversely affect the operations of
the Office of the Prosecutor in Arusha. In the
opinion of the Committee, these posts should
remain in Arusha, as approved by the General
Assembly.

31. Six new posts for language assistants are
proposed (A/56/497, annex IV, para. 18). Upon
enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that
this function was being carried out under general
temporary assistance and that the proposal was to
convert the positions to regular posts. There is a
corresponding reduction of $500,000 under other staff
costs (A/56/497, para. 54 (a)). The Committee
recommends acceptance of the request for six new

General Service (Local level) posts for language
assistants.

32. The Advisory Committee recommends against
the reclassification of the P-4 post of investigator to
a P-5 post for a commander to coordinate, among
other things, activities related to requests for new
investigations, requests for sketch maps, visits to
crime scenes and background checks on defence and
prosecution witnesses. The Committee is of the view
that an individual at the P-4 level or lower could
coordinate those activities.

33. An amount of $525,800 is requested for the
Office of the Prosecutor under consultants and experts,
an increase of $136,900 over the appropriation for
2000-2001 (A/56/497, para. 43). The Advisory
Committee was informed that of the $195,100
appropriated for consultants and experts for 2001,
$75,165 had been spent as at 30 September 2001. As
indicated in the performance report for 2000, there was
an underexpenditure of $249,200 under consultants and
experts for the Tribunal as a whole resulting from the
lower than anticipated number of expert witnesses used
by both the prosecution and the defence and the use of
only four out of the five consultants provided for in the
budget (A/56/500, para. 5). For 2002-2003, the
estimate for the Office of the Prosecutor is based on a
projection of 3 expert witnesses per trial in 2002 and 2
per trial in 2003, for a total of 30 expert prosecution
witnesses. In view of the past expenditure trends
under this item, the Committee recommends the
appropriation of $400,000 for consultants and
experts for the Office of the Prosecutor.

34. The estimate for travel for the Office of the
Prosecutor amounts to $3,310,000, reflecting an
increase of $1,482,600 as compared with the
appropriation for 2000-2001. Resources are requested
for travel in relation to investigations ($1,300,000) and
of tracking teams ($900,000) and travel of the
Prosecutor, Deputy Prosecutor, trial teams, appeals
counsel and other staff of the Office of the Prosecutor
($1,110,000) (A/56/497, para. 44). For 2001, the
requests were $312,900 for investigations, $299,500
for tracking teams and $326,300 for the Office of the
Prosecutor. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed
that as at 31 October 2001, $315,449 had been spent
for travel for investigations, $280,254 for tracking
teams and $333,071 for the Office of the Prosecutor.
Under the circumstances, the Committee



7
A/56/666

recommends the appropriation of a total of $3
million under travel for the Office of the Prosecutor.

35. An amount of $900,000 is proposed for general
operating expenses for the Office of the Prosecutor to
cover the operational expenses of the Intelligence
Tracking Unit, which is carrying out inquiries, through
agents, sources and contacts, relating to 91investigation
targets, 34 of whom are believed to be in Africa, 25 in
Europe and the balance in unknown locations (ibid.,
paras. 44 (b) and 45). For 2001, the projection for
general operating expenses was $388,000. The
Advisory Committee was informed that as at 31
October $174,073 had been spent. The Committee
requests that information on the effectiveness of
missions and the overall performance of the
Intelligence Tracking Unit be included in future
performance reports and estimates. The Committee
recommends acceptance of the request for general
operating expenses.

The Registry

36. The estimate for the Registry for 2002-2003
totals $150,052,500 gross ($138,265,100 net) before
recosting, an increase of $20,449,900 gross
($19,387,300 net), or 15.7 per cent, over the 2000-2001
appropriation of $129,602,600 gross ($118,877,800
net) (ibid., table 9). The requested resources would
provide for 757 posts, including 20 new Professional
posts and 75 new posts in the General Service and
related categories (ibid., tables 9 and 10). The
Advisory Committee notes that some of the General
Service posts represent conversions of posts previously
funded from general temporary assistance (see ibid.,
para. 53).

37. For 2001, the Advisory Committee recommended
approval of 49 additional posts for the Registry
(A/55/643, paras. 36-53). The Registry has experienced
vacancy rates of over 20 per cent for the first eight
months of 2001 (A/56/497/Add.1, annex III). Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that the vacancy
rate for both September and October was 22 per cent. It
appears to the Committee that the lower projections for
November and December indicated in annex III to the
budget may be overly optimistic in the light of past
experience. For example, projected vacancy rates for
Professional staff for the months of September to
December 2000 were 21.8, l9.9, 18.4 and 13.5 per cent
respectively (A/55/512 and Corr.1, annex III). The

Committee was informed that the actual rates were
21.5, 21.2, 22.7 and 20.9 per cent. In this connection,
the Committee notes also that although the Tribunal
was able to recruit 92 staff in 2001, 51 staff members
left the organization during the period (see
A/56/497/Add.1, annex VIII.B, para. 16). Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that a total of
170 personnel had been recruited under general
temporary assistance for various services in the
Tribunal in 2001.

38. The Advisory Committee exchanged views with
the Registrar on delegation of authority. It was
informed that the Registrar had authority for
recruitment up to and including the D-1 level.
Vacancies were normally advertised for 60 days;
however, in accordance with paragraph 3 of section IV
of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June
2001, unplanned vacancies were advertised for 30
days. The Committee recommends that the 30-day
procedure be followed for all senior Professional
posts in the Tribunal (see also para. 29 above).

39. An amount of $4,619,400 is requested under
other staff costs for 2002-2003, comprising $2.5
million for general temporary assistance, $600,000 for
overtime and $1,519,400 for contractual security
services (A/56/497, para. 54). For 2000, $1,500,000
was requested for general temporary assistance and
$300,000 for overtime. Given the high vacancy rates
in the Tribunal and the consequent need to resort to
general temporary assistance funds and overtime,
the Committee recommends acceptance of the
estimate for other staff costs.

40. An amount of $460,200 is requested for
consultants and experts (ibid., para. 55). In 2001,
$251,400 was requested for fees for 20 expert
witnesses and the services of consultancy firms to
assess the payroll and accounting system of the
Tribunal and to review the court management system
(A/55/512 and Corr.1, para. 56). The estimate for 2002-
2003 is based on the assumption that, on average, two
expert witnesses for the defence will be called for each
accused person. It is anticipated that 21 accused will be
on trial and 42 expert witnesses will be brought to
Arusha during the biennium at a cost of $309,200. In
addition, technology consultants will be required to
design and implement the Tribunal’s Intranet site
($20,000), to implement an electronic filing system for
the Court Management Section ($25,000) and to study
the impact of technology on the Tribunal ($25,000).

A/56/666

The latter is requested owing to the fact that there is a
considerably increased use of automated products and
equipment within the Tribunal, but there has been no
subsequent reduction in manpower or in paperwork as
a result of this new technology (A/56/497, para. 55
(d)). The Advisory Committee welcomes this
concern and expresses the hope that an expenditure
of $25,000 will provide the results to resolve this
apparent contradiction. The Committee
recommends approval of the request of $460,200 for
consultants and experts.

41. An amount of $2,240,000 is requested for the
Registry for travel, an increase of $1,053,000 over the
appropriation for 2000-2001 (ibid., para. 56). The
estimates include provision for travel of Registry staff
($1,200,000), travel of members of the Office of
Internal Oversight Services for internal audit
($40,000), travel and allowances of witnesses for the
prosecution and the defence ($900,000) and travel of
staff for the medical evacuation of detainees
($100,000). The amounts requested for 2001 were
$271,900 for travel of Registry staff, $18,900 for travel
of members of the Office of Internal Oversight
Services and $310,400 for travel and allowances of
witnesses (A/55/512 and Corr.1, para. 57).

42. The Advisory Committee notes that the estimate
for travel of witnesses is based on the assumption that
approximately 600 witnesses for the prosecution and
315 for the defence will be brought to Arusha during
the biennium (see A/56/497, para. 56 (b)). In this
connection, the Committee notes from the financial
performance report for the Tribunal for 2000 that the
total number of witnesses projected to be called for that
year for both the prosecution and the defence was 210;
the actual number called was 61 (see A/56/500, annex).
For 2001, the estimate was for 240 witnesses for the
prosecution and 100 for the defence; the Committee
was informed that as at 31 October 2001, 145
prosecution witnesses and 1 defence witness had been
called (A/56/497/Add.1, annex VI). On the basis of
past experience, the estimate of a total of 915
witnesses to be called in 2002-2003 appears to the
Committee to be rather high. Accordingly, the
Committee recommends approval of an amount of
$2,100,000 for travel of the Registry.

43. Requirements of $20,535,400 are estimated for
contractual services for the Registry in the biennium
2002-2003, an increase of $6,806,100 over the
appropriation for 2000-2001 (A/56/497, para. 57). The

bulk of the requirement is for defence counsel
($18,991,200), and it is based on the expectation that
the number of accused persons will increase from 46 to
86 during the biennium. The Advisory Committee
recalls that for 2001, $7,931,800 was requested, of
which $6,365,600 was for defence counsel, and that as
at 30 June 2000 there were 41 lead defence counsel and
19 co-counsel representing the defendants (see
A/55/512 and Corr.1, para. 58). Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that as at 30 September 2001,
the expenditure for defence counsel amounted to
$7,256,400 and that there were 46 lead counsel, 30 co-
counsel and 3 detainees with duty counsel as at 31
October 2001.

44. The Advisory Committee enquired about the
effectiveness of the changes that have been introduced
to manage, monitor and control the legal aid system.
The information provided orally was not sufficient for
the Committee to form an opinion as to the adequacy of
those measures. The Committee is of the opinion that
there is a need to ensure the effective operation of
oversight mechanisms in the Tribunals.
Accordingly, the Committee requests that in its next
audit, the Board of Auditors carry out a special
evaluation of the effectiveness of the means
available, including staff and non-staff assets, to
manage, monitor and control the expenses of the
Tribunal’s legal aid system.

45. For the reasons given in the foregoing
paragraphs, the Advisory Committee recommends
approval of $19,500,000 out of the amount of
$20,535,400 requested for contractual services for
the Registry.

46. A total of $14,274,600 is requested for the
Registry under general operating expenses, an increase
of $3,376,900 over the appropriation for 2000-2001
(A/56/497, para. 59). The estimate includes an amount
of $4,567,000 for rental of premises. It also includes
resources for general maintenance of the facilities at
Arusha and Kigali ($815,800); electricity, water and
diesel fuel for generators for premises at Arusha and
Kigali ($1,122,200); rental and operation of fixed-wing
aircraft ($1,752,000); commercial communications
($2,821,900); miscellaneous services ($3,193,800); and
bank charges, insurance costs and freight charges
($817,700).

47. Under miscellaneous services, estimates include
witness support and protection costs, which are



9
A/56/666

estimated at $640,000. The information before the
Advisory Committee indicates that performance in this
area is consistently lower than projected (see para. 42
above). Also included is an estimated requirement of
$773,500 to meet costs relating to the enforcement of
sentences, including the maintenance and medical care
of prisoners and inspection costs (ibid.). Upon request,
the Committee was provided with breakdowns of both
the estimated requirement of $773,500 (see annex II
below) and the daily cost of maintaining prisoners (see
annex III below). The Tribunal has signed agreements
with the Governments of Mali and Benin to provide
prison facilities, and negotiations are under way with
four other countries.

48. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in his
budget proposal for the Tribunal for 2001, the
Secretary-General had requested an amount of
$250,000 for enforcement of sentences in respect of the
agreement with Mali and Benin, which was to include
the cost of upgrading the prison facilities ($213,500)
and maintenance of prisoners ($36,500) (see A/55/512
and Corr.1, para. 60 (g)). In its report, the Committee
concluded that the enforcement of sentences was an
important emerging issue that was being handled in an
ad hoc manner without a carefully thought-out long-
term plan of action (A/55/643, para. 63). It was the
understanding of the Committee that the $250,000 was
intended as an interim provision of assistance pending
the resolution of the issues involved in the report to be
submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with
paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 55/226.

49. The Advisory Committee was informed that out
of the $213,500 authorized for upgrading prison
facilities, only $43,300 was expended; following a
ruling by the Office of Legal Affairs, the remainder has
not been used by the Tribunal, nor have funds been
requested for that purpose in the budget submission for
2002-2003. The Committee is of the opinion that the
Secretary-General should have immediately
provided the General Assembly with the reasons for
not using the funds it authorized. It remains a fact
that the resources previously authorized by the
Assembly have thus far not been used. An
explanation as to the legal and financial reasons for
this situation is therefore required and should be
submitted, by February 2002, in the report called
for by the Assembly in its resolution 55/226.

50. Resources in the amount of $3,813,000 are
requested under supplies and materials, an increase of

$882,100 over the appropriation for 2000-2001
(A/56/497, paras. 60-61). The Advisory Committee
notes that the increase is attributable largely to the
anticipated increase in the level of staff of the Tribunal,
the increase in the number of proceedings, the need for
replacement parts and maintenance of equipment, an
increase in the cost of petrol, oil and lubricants and an
anticipated increase in the number of detainees.

51. An amount of $5,927,500, reflecting an increase
of $621,900 over the appropriation for 2000-2001, is
requested under furniture and equipment, including
$500,000 for the development of a teleconferencing
facility between the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda and the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia (ibid., para. 62).

52. The Advisory Committee notes that it is planned
to replace 45 of the Tribunal’s 175 vehicles (see ibid.,
paras. 59(e)(vi) and 62(e)) because of age and
accidents. The Committee was informed that the
vehicles being replaced were from the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Rwanda and had become
uneconomical to use. It was also informed that,
because of the rugged terrain, the Tribunal required
special vehicles, and that each vehicle would cost
$20,700. On the basis of the information provided
orally by representatives of the Tribunal, the
Committee recommends that greater effort be made
to use the systems contract procurement procedure
followed for peacekeeping operations to procure
vehicles.

53. A provision of $650,000 is requested for
construction, alteration, improvements and major
maintenance, reflecting a decrease of $1,331,400 over
the appropriation for 2000-2001 (ibid., para. 63). The
estimate covers improvements to premises in Arusha
and Kigali ($450,000) and construction work at the
United Nations Detention Facility ($200,000). In
connection with the estimate for improvements to
premises in Arusha and Kigali, the Committee was
informed that the construction of the new archive
facility in Arusha for the storage of evidence and
documents was nearly complete. The Committee
welcomes this measure to protect the records of the
work of the Tribunal. Furthermore, the Committee
requests that, in the context of the next budget
submission, a long-term plan be formulated for the
disposition and preservation of the records of the
Tribunal.



10

A/56/666

54. Under grants and contributions, estimated
requirements amount to $1,104,200, an increase of
$748,200 over the appropriation for 2000-2001 (ibid.,
para. 64). The estimate includes the contributions of
the Tribunal to the operations of the United Nations
Medical Clinic at Kigali ($192,000) and the
coordination of United Nations security measures
($912,200).

55. Subject to a decision to be taken by the
General Assembly on the amount of $773,500 (see
paras. 47-49 above), the Advisory Committee
recommends approval of the amounts requested
under general operating expenses; supplies and
materials; furniture and equipment; improvement
of premises; and grants and contributions.

56. A summary of new, reclassified and redeployed
posts in the Registry is contained in table 11 of the
budget report (A/56/497), and detailed information and
justifications for the changes are contained in annex IV
to the report (A/56/497/Add.1).

57. A new P-5 post is requested for the Chief of
External Relations (A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV, para.
24). The Advisory Committee was informed that the
proposal was based on a recommendation of the
management review and that the Press and Public
Affairs Unit would be part of the External Relations
Section. Both would be headed by a P-5. The Chief of
External Relations would also be involved in fund-
raising activities. The Committee notes that there is
also currently a position for spokesperson for the
Tribunal. For the reasons stated in paragraphs 24
and 25 of annex IV to the budget document, the
Committee recommends approval of the request for
a P-5 for Chief of External Relations and trusts that
the Tribunal will strengthen its capacity to interact
with print and broadcast media. Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed of the intention to recruit a
suitably qualified bilingual officer capable of dealing
with national and international media, with a view to
increasing public awareness of the work and
accomplishments of the Tribunal. The Committee also
recommends approval of the post of bilingual
secretary to provide support to the Office of the
Registrar and the External Relations Section (ibid.,
para. 27; see also para. 59 below).

58. A new P-4 post is requested for an investigator to
provide capacity to trace the assets of suspects and
accused persons detained under the Tribunal’s authority

(ibid., para. 26). Upon enquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the function of the post
would also include the investigation of weaknesses
related to the management of the defence counsel
payment system. The Committee has requested an
external audit assessment of the adequacy of the
Tribunal’s capacity in this area (see para. 44 above). In
the meantime, the Committee recommends approval
of the request for the P-4 post.

59. The redeployment of a P-3 protocol officer from
Kigali to Arusha is proposed for the Press and Public
Affairs Unit (ibid., para. 30). According to the
Registrar, this change is being proposed to implement a
recommendation of the management review that all
borrowed posts in the Tribunal should be returned to
their respective units. In this connection, the
Advisory Committee is of the opinion that where
vacancies are high it may well be appropriate to be
able to assign both personnel and posts with
flexibility in order to meet priority requirements.
Moreover, in the opinion of the Committee, the
practical implications of not having a protocol
officer in Kigali do not appear to have been
adequately analysed. The Committee recognizes the
importance of providing protocol services in Kigali.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends a review
of the matter. Should a determination be made that
a protocol officer is required, the need should be
met, in the first instance, through redeployment
and/or general temporary assistance and reported
in the financial and programme performance report
referred to in paragraph 3 above. In any case, the
Committee recommends approval of the proposed
redeployment from Kigali to Arusha in view of the
priority being given to the Press and Public Affairs
Unit (see para. 57 above).

60. A new P-2 post is requested for an associate
administrative officer to administer the activities of the
Tribunal’s internship programme (ibid., para. 33). The
Advisory Committee notes that interns perform a
variety of functions for the Tribunal, including
conducting research and providing assistance to trial
judges and attorneys in the Office of the Prosecutor.
The Committee welcomes the information provided
to it on the programme and requests that future
reports include details, by unit, on how interns are
used. The Committee recommends approval of the
P-2 post for an associate administrative officer to
manage the internship programme.



11

A/56/666

61. In the Chambers Support Section, a new P-5 is
requested for a senior legal adviser (ibid., paras.
35-36). The Section currently has two P-5 posts. The
additional P-5 post is requested to ensure that each of
the three trial chambers has an experienced senior
lawyer. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the request.

62. A new P-3 post is requested for a judgement
coordinator in the Chambers Support Section, because
the concurrent trials of many defendants are likely to
increase the demands on judgement coordinating (ibid.,
paras. 37-38). The Advisory Committee notes that at
present there is a trial chamber coordinator (P-3) for
each trial chamber who supervises a team of associate
legal officers (P-2). It would appear that a
coordinator post is being requested to fulfil the
function of coordinating the coordinators of the
three trial chambers. Furthermore, the request for
a P-3 post seems to be premature, as it assumes that
the present complement of coordinators may not be
adequate in the near future. The Committee is of
the view that in a situation such as this, a request
for additional posts should be based on actual
experience of workload and demand. Accordingly,
the Committee does not recommend approval of the
request for the P-3 post.

63. The current establishment of the Appeals
Chamber Support Unit at The Hague is one P-4, one
P-3, four P-2 and three General Service staff, or a total
of nine posts. Four additional posts are requested (1
P-3, 2 P-2 and 1 General Service) owing to the volume
of cases under consideration by the Appeals Chamber
and the arrival of two additional judges (ibid., para. 41;
see also para. 65 below). The Advisory Committee
observes that it is doubtful whether there has been
enough experience to determine the additional level of
support that is required. Accordingly, the Committee
does not recommend approval of the request for two
new P-2 posts and one General Service (Other level)
post to support the new appeals judges at this stage,
especially in view of the fact that when the decision
was taken to appoint the additional judges, three
posts (2 P-2/1 and 1 General Service) were
requested for them (A/55/512 and Corr.1, annex IX,
para. 7 and A/55/512/Add.1). Those three posts were
approved by the General Assembly pursuant to the
recommendation of the Committee. The Committee
recommends approval of the P-3 post to create a
second legal drafting section to allow the Unit to

handle two simultaneous appeals on their merits. If
the recommendations of the Committee are
approved by the Assembly, the total staff of the Unit
would be 10 posts rather than 13 as proposed;
however, the workload situation should be
monitored and, as appropriate, reported to the
Assembly (see para. 3 above).

64. A P-2 post is requested in the Appeals Support
Unit in Arusha for an associate legal/appeals officer to
assist the appeals officer with regard to drafting
submissions to chambers under rule 33B of the Statute
of the Tribunal (A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV, paras.
46-49). The individual would also act as courtroom
officer and perform other functions such as overseeing
the processing of interlocutory appeals and assisting in
the reading and review of all judicial documents filed
and processed.

65. The present staffing establishment comprises one
P-4, one P-2 and one General Service staff. The
Advisory Committee notes from the financial
performance report of the Tribunal for 2000 (see
A/56/500, annex) that 7 appeals were projected for the
Chambers and 15 were implemented; for 2001, the
Committee was informed that of the 40 projected, 8
were under way as at 31 October; and 30 are projected
for 2002-2003. For the Office of the Prosecutor, of the
16 appeals projected for 2000, 7 were implemented; for
2001, 28 were projected and 8 were under way as at 31
October; and 12 are projected for 2002-2003.
Although the above trend does not definitively
justify the establishment of a new P-2 post at this
stage, the Committee nevertheless recommends that
the P-2 post be granted in view of the current
staffing establishment, the time it takes to recruit
and the increased pace of work of the Chambers.

66. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the request for a new General Service
post for an audio-visual archivist and the
conversion to established status of the five General
Service posts for document assistants for the Audio-
Visual Desk (A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV, paras.
51-52).



12

A/56/666

Witnesses and Victims Support
Sections

67. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
current staffing establishment of the Witnesses and
Victims Support Sections for the prosecution and the
defence totalled 41 posts. For the defence, there are
currently 8 posts in Arusha, 4 in Kigali and 3 for safe
houses, for a total of 15. For the prosecution, current
staffing is 11 posts in Arusha, 12 in Kigali and 3 for
safe houses, for a total of 26. The budget proposal
includes requests for the reclassification of a P-4 post
to the P-5 level and a total of 34 new posts for the
sections (ibid., paras. 56-78). The Committee notes that
this would represent an increase of approximately 82
per cent in total staffing of the sections. Upon request,
the Committee was provided with the current vacancy
rates for each of the units of the sections as follows:
the rates for the defence as at 31 October were 14.3 per
cent in Arusha and 50 per cent in Kigali, and the rates
for the prosecution were 7.1 per cent in Arusha and
41.7 per cent in Kigali.

68. A total of 18 new posts are requested for the
Witnesses and Victims Support Section for the
prosecution, as follows:

(a) 12 new posts in Arusha: 1 P-2 associate
witness support officer, 1 General Service (Other level)
security officer and 10 General Service (Local level)
posts (1 security officer, 2 drivers, 3 cooks and 4
cleaners);

(b) 6 new posts in Kigali: 1 General Service
(Other level) security officer and 5 General Service
(Local level) posts (1 housekeeper, 2 cooks, 1 driver
and 1 witness support assistant).

69. A total of 16 new posts are requested for the
Witnesses and Victims Support Section for the defence,
as follows:

(a) 12 new posts in Arusha: 3 General Service
(Other level) posts (2 witness support assistants and 1
security officer) and 9 General Service (Local level)
posts (2 security assistants, 2 drivers, 2 cooks and 3
cleaners);

(b) 4 new posts in Kigali: 2 General Service
(Other level) security officers and 2 General Service
(Local level) drivers.

70. The Advisory Committee notes that a
restructuring is proposed that would combine the two

separate units for the prosecution and the defence into
a single section in early 2002 under one chief at the P-5
level (see ibid., paras. 70-71). A request is therefore
made to reclassify the head of the Prosecution Section
from P-4 to P-5. The Committee recalls that the two
services were previously combined. In 2000, the
Registrar initiated a restructuring:

“not only because of the vastly expanded
workload of the Section, but also with a view to
safeguarding the confidentiality of the individual
witnesses and ensuring that the identity and
security of prosecution and defence witnesses was
not compromised. As a result the Witnesses and
Victims Support Section has been reconstituted
into two separate sections, one dealing
exclusively with prosecution witnesses and
related issues, and the other dealing solely with
the defence witnesses and related issues.”

(A/55/512 and Corr.1, annex II, para. 79). The head of
the original combined service at the P-4 level became
Chief of the Witnesses and Victims Support Section for
the defence, and a P-4 post was requested for Chief of
the Witnesses and Victims Support Section for the
prosecution. The Committee calls into question the
rationale for the proposed restructuring and does
not support the proposed reclassification.

71. The Advisory Committee observes that the
statistics provided in the budget report
(A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV, para. 59) do not justify
the expansion of the Witnesses and Victims Support
Sections to the extent proposed in the estimate. The
fact that 150 prosecution witnesses were brought to
Arusha for testimony between January 1997 and
August 2000 implies an average of no more that 50 per
year. For 2000, the total number of prosecution and
defence witnesses supported by the Witnesses and
Victims Support Sections was 61 out of a projected 210
(A/56/500, annex). According to the updated workload
indicators provided to the Committee, for 2001, out of
an estimated 240 witnesses, the Witnesses and Victims
Support Section for the prosecution had supported 145
as at 31 October; the Witnesses and Victims Support
Section for the defence had supported only 1 out of a
projected 100.

72. In view of the workload trends in this area, the
Advisory Committee questions the extent of the
requested increases in terms of posts and other
budgetary proposals for witness and victim support.



13

A/56/666

Accordingly, in the paragraphs below the
Committee recommends approval of a total of 23
posts out of the 34 requested. The Committee
further recommends that the workload trend be
monitored and, if it is determined that more
support is required, it should be met from general
temporary assistance and reported in the context of
the financial and programme performance report
referred to in paragraph 3 above.

73. A P-2 post is requested to supervise witness
support assistants, translators and interpreters in the
Witnesses and Victims Support Section for the
prosecution in Arusha (A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV,
para. 60). In line with its comments in the foregoing
paragraphs, the Advisory Committee recommends
that an appropriate official from the present
staffing establishment, including General Service
and other levels of staff, be designated as the
supervisor of witness support assistants.

74. Two General Service posts (1 Other level and 1
Local level) are requested for security officers for the
Witnesses and Victims Support Section for the
prosecution in Arusha (ibid., para. 61). The Advisory
Committee recommends approval of this request.

75. With respect to the two Local level posts
requested for drivers for the Witnesses and Victims
Support Section for the prosecution in Arusha
(ibid., para. 62), the Advisory Committee
recommends approval of one position, since it is not
certain whether there will indeed be six trials
running simultaneously.

76. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of two cooks to service two prosecution
safe houses in Arusha rather than the three
requested, and four cleaners (ibid., paras. 63-64).

77. For the six additional General Service posts
requested for the Witnesses and Victims Support
Section for the prosecution in Kigali (ibid., paras.
65-67), the Advisory Committee recommends
approval of one new General Service (Other level)
post for a security officer and two Local level posts
for the functions mentioned in paragraphs 66 and
67, for a total of three new posts.

78. For the Witnesses and Victims Support Section
for the defence, three General Service (Other level) and
nine General Service (Local level) posts are proposed
for Arusha, and two General Service (Other level) and

two General Service (Local level) posts are proposed
for Kigali (ibid., paras. 68-78). In view of its
comments above and its recommendations for the
Witnesses and Victims Support Section for the
prosecution, the Advisory Committee recommends
approval of one General Service (Other level) post
and five General Service (Local level) posts for the
Witnesses and Victims Support Section for the
defence in Arusha. For Kigali, the Committee
recommends approval of the four posts requested.

79. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the request for an additional General
Service (Local level) post for an administrative
assistant to supplement the current establishment of
one P-4, one P-3, one General Service (Principal
level), two General Service (Other level) and one
General Service (Local level) in the Defence
Counsel Management Section (ibid., para. 81).

80. The current staffing establishment of the Legal
Library and Reference Unit comprises one P-3, one P-
2, one General Service (Other level) and two General
Service (Local level) posts. The Advisory Committee
recommends approval of the request for two
additional P-2 posts for a reference and technical
services librarian and an indexer/cataloguer. The
Committee agrees with the proposal to reclassify the
Chief Librarian from P-3 to P-4 (ibid., paras.
85-87).

81. The Advisory Committee notes that the former
Division of Administration has been reorganized and
renamed the Administrative and Support Services
Division pursuant to a recommendation of the
management review team. The Committee
recommends approval of the request for a P-4 stress
manager to develop and implement a counselling
and support programme aimed at reducing stress
levels of Tribunal staff and dependents (ibid., para.
91). The Committee is not convinced, however, of
the need for a P-4 post for an administrative liaison
officer to prevent the recurrence of a “collision of
cultures” between the United Nations Secretariat
and the legal profession found in the Office of the
Prosecutor and the Chambers (ibid., para. 92). It is
the opinion of the Committee that the Chambers,
the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry have
to perform their functions in accordance with the
provisions of the Statute of the Tribunal subject to
such guidelines as may, from time to time, be given
by the General Assembly in the context of the



14

A/56/666

review and approval of the expenses of the three
organs of the Tribunal.

82. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the request for two new General Service
(Local level) posts for a laboratory technician to
maintain the new laboratory to be established
within the Health Services Unit at Arusha and a
nurse to provide dispensary services in Kigali (ibid.,
paras. 95-96).

83. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the General Service (Local level) post
requested for a job classification assistant in the
Personnel Administration Unit (ibid., para. 102).

84. In the Training, Staff Welfare and Counselling
Unit, two new General Service (Local level) posts are
requested for training clerks in the areas of language
training and pre-recruitment testing (ibid., para. 106).
The Committee recommends acceptance of this
request.

85. The Advisory Committee notes that a total of
seven new posts are requested for the Accounts,
Payments, Payroll and Cashier Units, the Claims Unit
of the General Services Section and the Transportation
Services Sections as follows: one General Service
(Local level) accounts clerk; two General Service
(Other level) finance assistants; one General Service
(Other level) finance assistant; one General Service
(Local level) finance clerk; one General Service (Other
level) claims assistant; and a General Service (Local
level) storekeeper (ibid., paras. 112-129). In view of
the study to be undertaken on the impact of
technology on Tribunal operations, for which
$25,000 has been requested (see para. 40 above), the
Committee recommends that these functions be
accommodated through temporary redeployment
using vacant positions and general temporary
assistance pending the conclusion of the study. The
results should be reported in the context of the
financial and programme performance report.

86. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was
informed that the payroll function for international
personnel had not been transferred to Arusha. In this
connection, the Committee reiterates its view that
the Tribunal should have the appropriate delegated
authority to carry out this function as soon as
possible (see A/55/643, para. 15).

87. In view of its comments in paragraph 85
above, the Advisory Committee does not
recommend approval of the reclassification from

the P-2 to the P-3 level of the post of the chief of the
Kigali Unit of the Electronic Data-Processing/
Management Information Systems Section
(A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV, para. 132).

88. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the proposed changes in staffing in the
Procurement Unit as follows: one new General
Service (Local level) post for a procurement
assistant in the Kigali Unit; the reclassification of a
P-2 procurement officer post in Arusha to General
Service (Principal level); and the redeployment of
one P-2 post from the Office of the Deputy Chief of
Administration to the Procurement Unit in Kigali
(ibid., paras. 135-136).

89. The current staffing level of the United Nations
Detention Facility is two P-3 and 18 General Service
(Local level) posts. Requests are made for nine new
General Service (Local level) posts for five
escorts/custodians, three cleaners and one cook; the
reclassification of the post of Commanding Officer
from P-3 to P-4; and the redeployment of one Security
Service officer and six General Service (Local level)
security officers from the Security Section to the
Detention Facility (ibid., paras. 139-142).

90. The Advisory Committee notes that in 2000 the
number of projected arrests was 20, whereas 5 were
arrested (see A/56/500, annex). While 12 arrests were
projected for 2001, the Committee was informed that
as of 31 October, 8 arrests had been made. For 2002-
2003, 20 arrests are projected. According to the
information provided to the Committee, the current
number of detainees/prisoners is 51, and it is estimated
that the number will reach 60 by the end of the year
(A/56/497/Add.1, annex IV, para. 138).

91. The Advisory Committee recommends
approval of the proposed staffing changes for the
United Nations Detention Facility.

92. The current staffing level of the Language and
Meeting Services Section comprises 75 posts. Requests
are made for 10 new language posts as follows: 4 new
P-2 level posts for interpreters of Kinyarwanda; 3
General Service (Other level) posts (2 bilingual
secretaries and 1 bilingual reference assistant) in the
Text-processing, Proof-reading, Terminology and
Reference Unit; and 1 P-4 reviser and 2 P-3
translators/interpreters for language support to the
Appeals Chamber Unit at The Hague.

93. The four new P-2 posts for interpreters are
requested to meet the interpretation requirements of the



15

A/56/666

six benches (ibid., para. 146). The Advisory
Committee recommends approval of the request.
Furthermore, the Committee recommends that a
review be made of the cost-effectiveness of using
translation capacities in the United Nations system
by remote means.

94. With regard to the request for three General
Service (Other level) posts for two bilingual secretaries
and one bilingual reference assistant in the Text-
processing, Proof-reading, Terminology and Reference
Unit, the Advisory Committee notes that there is
currently only one text processor working in the
Kinyarwanda Unit (ibid., paras. 147-150). The
Advisory Committee recognizes the need for a
reference assistant to handle the reference requirements
of the 43 translators/interpreters and revisers as well as
the need to have an appropriate ratio of support staff to
substantive officers. For these reasons, the
Committee recommends approval of the request.

95. The current staffing establishment for language
support to the Appeals Chamber at The Hague
comprises one P-4 reviser, one P-3 interpreter/
translator and one General Service (Other level)
bilingual secretary (ibid., paras. 152-155). The
Advisory Committee recommends approval of the
request for three additional posts: one P-4 for a
reviser, one P-3 for an English-French translator/
interpreter and one P-3 for a French-English
translator/interpreter.

96. The Advisory Committee recommends that the
General Service (Local level) post requested for a
courtroom clerk in the Communications Section be
approved (ibid., para. 162).

Conclusions and recommendations

97. On the basis of the recommendations and
observations indicated in the foregoing paragraphs,
the Advisory Committee recommends that the
General Assembly approve the appropriation of
$196,444,800 gross ($177,151,400 net) for the
operations of the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda for the biennium 2002-2003. This would
represent a reduction of $2,079,000 gross
($1,863,900 net) from the estimate of $198,523,800
gross ($179,015,300 net) indicated in table 3 of the
proposed budget (A/56/497).

98. The post reductions recommended by the
Committee in the present report are summarized in
