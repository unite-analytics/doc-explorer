Agenda item 134
Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations

Financial performance report for the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 and proposed budget for the period
from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 for the support account
for peacekeeping operations

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

Appropriation for 2002/03 $100,896,200

Expenditure for 2002/03 $97,145,400

Appropriation for 2003/04 $112,075,800

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2004/05 $122,093,400

Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2004/05 $121,278,900

I. Introduction

1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee would entail a
reduction of $814,500 in the proposed budget for the support account for the
period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The reasons for this are set out in
paragraphs 16 to 86 below. The Committee also makes a number of
observations and recommendations with regard to the administration and
management of the resources of the support account for peacekeeping
operations and areas of possible savings.

2. The Advisory Committee’s general report on the administrative and
budgetary aspects of peacekeeping operations (A/58/759) contains its views and
recommendations on a number of cross-cutting issues. Consequently, in the



2
A/58/760

paragraphs below, the Committee deals only with resources and other items
that relate specifically to the support account for peacekeeping operations.

3. The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the
proposed budget for the support account for peacekeeping operations are listed at
the end of the present report.

II. Format and presentation

4. The Advisory Committee welcomes the additional refinements to the results-
based presentation for the support account for 2004/05, as requested by the
Committee in its previous report (see A/57/776, paras. 3-8). The Committee notes
that the presentation for 2004/05 for the support account lists three expected
accomplishments. A fourth one, the reorientation of the management culture, which
was undertaken by the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations in the 2003/04 budget, is no longer in the 2004/05 budget proposal, since
it focuses on the internal management of the Department. In response to a previous
recommendation of the Committee, budget proposals for 2004/05 reflect a
significantly higher percentage of more clearly measurable indicators of
achievement and outputs (see A/58/715, para. 6). This should further facilitate
monitoring and reporting on performance.

5. The performance report for the support account for the period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 (A/58/703 and Add.1) includes, for the first time, actual
indicators of achievement and outputs. The Advisory Committee found the
presentation lengthy and cumbersome, particularly in the addendum to the
report. Many of the indicators of achievement and outputs for the period
2002/03 did not provide verifiable and measurable data; the result was that the
performance report contains long explanations concerning completion or new
target dates. The Committee expects the performance report for the period
2003/04 to be more concrete, streamlined and reader-friendly. In addition,
there should be more careful scrutiny to ensure that external factors are
relevant and realistic.

6. Further comments and observations of the Advisory Committee on the
results-based budget presentation are contained in its general report on
peacekeeping operations (A/58/759).

7. The Advisory Committee continues to be of the opinion that, as an
important component of the proposed budget, all resources for training should
be transparently reflected in the budget. Further comments are contained in
the Advisory Committee’s general report.

8. The Advisory Committee notes the inclusion of a summary of follow-up action
taken to implement its requests and recommendations, as endorsed by the General
Assembly, as well as those of the Assembly itself, in annex III of the budget
document (A/58/715).

A/58/760

III. Financial performance for the period from 1 July 2002
to 30 June 2003

9. The Advisory Committee recalls that the total support account resources for
post and non-post requirements approved for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June
2003 amounted to $100,896,200 gross ($87,156,900 net), including a total
establishment of 702 temporary posts (see General Assembly resolution 56/293 of
27 June 2002).

10. As indicated in the Secretary-General’s report (A/58/703), expenditure for the
period amounted to $97,145,400 gross ($84,088,100 net), resulting in an
unencumbered balance of $3,750,800 gross ($3,068,800 net) — in gross terms, 3.7
per cent of the approved resources for the period. This reflects a budget
implementation rate of 96.3 per cent, a 2.3 per cent improvement over the rate in
2001/02.

11. The Advisory Committee notes that the unencumbered balance was essentially
attributable to the fact that the actual vacancy rate for the reporting period was
higher than that budgeted. An overall vacancy factor of 8 per cent for the
Professional category and of 2.5 per cent for the General Service category had been
budgeted for the 702 continuing posts approved for the period from 1 July 2002 to
30 June 2003 by the General Assembly in its resolution 56/293. The actual vacancy
rates were 11 per cent and 3.7 per cent, respectively. The related savings amounted
to $1,829,800 out of $81,539,600 approved for posts.

12. The Advisory Committee’s comments on the information contained in the
performance report on individual objects of expenditure can be found, where
relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to
30 June 2005, in section V below.

IV. Updated financial information in respect of the
current period

13. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in its resolution
57/318 of 18 June 2003, approved an amount of $112,075,800 gross ($96,755,600
net) for support account post and non-post resources for the period from 1 July 2003
to 30 June 2004 and a total staffing establishment of 743 support account temporary
posts.

14. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that expenditure as at
29 February 2004 amounted to $70,298,400 (see annex I).

15. Of the 743 currently approved posts (454 Professional, 286 General Service
and 3 security posts), as at 29 February 2004 a total of 708 were encumbered (425
Professional, 280 General Service and 3 security).

A/58/760

V. Proposed cost estimates for the period from 1 July 2004
to 30 June 2005

General

16. The Secretary-General, in his report A/58/715, estimates support account
resources for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 at $122,093,400 gross
($105,619,900 net), which would provide for the staffing of 762 temporary support
account posts.

17. The amount proposed, in gross terms, represents an increase of $10,017,600 or
8.9 per cent ($8,864,300 in net terms) over the total amount of $112,075,800 gross
($96,755,600 net) approved for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (see
A/58/715, para. 3). Most of the increase is due to the changes in standard salary
costs ($9 million) and the requirements for 19 new posts ($1.2 million), offset by a
reduction in non-post resources ($0.2 million).

18. The overall resources estimated for posts ($100,772,400) take into account the
proposed establishment of 19 additional support account posts. These include:

(a) One new post in the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman;

(b) Seven posts in the Office of Internal Oversight Services;

(c) Eleven posts in the Department of Management (2 in the Treasury
Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, 4 in the Office
of Human Resources Management and 5 in the Office of Central Support Services).

The Committee’s recommendations on those proposals are contained in its
discussion of the organizational units to which they relate. No reclassifications are
proposed.

19. The Committee further notes that staff turnover factors of 5.5 per cent and 2.3
per cent have been applied to continuing posts in the Professional and General
Service staff categories, respectively, and delayed recruitment factors of 50 per cent
and 35 per cent have been applied for new posts in the Professional and General
Service categories, respectively, in the costing exercise.

20. In paragraph 18 of its resolution 57/318, the General Assembly decided that
“any support account posts that remain vacant and any new posts that are not filled
for twelve months from the date of their establishment would require rejustification
in the subsequent budget submission”, and requested the Secretary-General “to
report to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on the implementation of
this decision”. The Advisory Committee notes that a total of 16 posts that were
vacant for 12 months as at 31 August 2003 have been “rejustified” for the period
2004/05, in response to paragraph 18 of resolution 57/318. Information relating to
such posts is included in section II of A/58/715 for each unit, under the heading
“Analysis of resource requirements”. The Advisory Committee points out that the
requirement in resolution 57/318 is in relation to the support account posts that
remain vacant and any new posts that are not filled for 12 months from the
date of their establishment. That requirement is based on a recommendation of
the Committee contained in paragraph 79 of its general report on peacekeeping
operations for 2003/04 (A/57/772).



5
A/58/760

21. The Advisory Committee emphasizes that the intent of that
recommendation was to reconsider posts that were still vacant at the time of the
next budget submission. However, the implementation of this requirement, as
described in paragraph 21 of the Secretary-General’s report (A/58/715), is not
consistent with General Assembly resolution 57/318, in that the report deals
with posts that were vacant for 12 months as at 31 August 2003 — a stipulation
that is not included in either the original recommendation of the Committee or
the subsequent decision of the Assembly. The result is that most of the posts
“resubmitted” have already been filled, thus making any further action on
them difficult. What should be submitted in future is an indication, as of
February, of posts that will likely still be vacant by the time the Fifth
Committee considers the support account budget in May and that will have
been vacant for at least 12 months by 30 June of a given year.

22. Moreover, the explanation provided for the rejustification of the posts
should constitute more than a description of the functions related to the post; it
should address the reasons for the vacancy, how the functions were provided
while the post was vacant and a specific justification of why the post is still
needed. Such information should be included in future.

23. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that delays in filling vacancies
have a negative impact not only on the efficient functioning of the offices
involved, but also on the peacekeeping missions themselves, as well as
potentially on staff morale. The Committee urges the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Human Resources Management to
expedite the generic job description process.

24. The request in paragraph 19 of General Assembly resolution 57/318 for details
of upward and downward reclassification of posts and a breakdown of appointments
and type of candidate (internal or external) for the past two years is addressed in
paragraphs 22 and 23 of A/58/715. As to the request in paragraph 10 of the same
resolution for a report on measures taken to improve the representation of
underrepresented and unrepresented Member States and criteria used for recruitment
for all support account posts, the Advisory Committee notes that a separate report
will be submitted to the Assembly during the resumed part of its fifty-eighth session
(see A/58/715, annex III.B).

25. The resources for consultants are estimated at $1,746,300, an increase of
$659,000 over the approved resources of $1,087,300 for 2003/04. The Advisory
Committee notes that most of the increase ($464,600) relates to additional
requirements under the Department of Management. In this connection, the
Committee stresses the need to always verify that specialized expertise sought
elsewhere is not available anywhere in-house (i.e., the United Nations
Secretariat) or in the United Nations system. Furthermore, if consultancies are
the only option, efforts should be made to ensure a skills transfer or multiplier
effect in the units where the consultants are hired so that the benefits achieved
are shared with or passed on to the staff.

26. Resources for official travel are proposed at $4,472,400, an increase of
$503,400 over the $3,969,000 approved for 2003/04. Total travel expenditure
amounted to $2,612,900 during 2002/03. The savings reported for that period
($628,600) resulted in large part from the cancellation of travel to the Middle East
for security reasons. Most of the increase in the provision proposed for 2004/05



6
A/58/760

relates to additional resources for training-related travel in the Military Division of
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and additional requirements under the
Office of Internal Oversight Services (see paras. 44 and 59 below). The Advisory
Committee expects, as delegation of authority to the field increases and a large
amount of resources are invested in communications, information technology
and training, that the demand for travel should decrease. Any savings achieved
should be reported in the performance report.

27. A provision of $899,900 is proposed for communications for 2004/05, an
increase of 10.5 per cent over the resources of $814,700 approved for 2003/04.
Expenditure of $792,600 is reported for 2002/03, reflecting savings of $63,800. For
information technology, an amount of $5,255,600 is proposed, a decrease of
$601,900, or 10.3 per cent, from the $5,857,500 approved for 2003/04. This relates
mostly to a decrease in requirements under maintenance of information technology
equipment. Expenditure of $4,864,800 is reported for 2002/03. The savings of
$659,300 reported during that period were due mostly to the sharing of information
technology facilities between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the
Information Technology Services Division (see A/58/703, para. 11).

28. Decreases are also shown for other supplies, services and equipment
($572,300) and facilities and infrastructure ($249,700) in view of the fact that the
2003/04 budget included a one-time provision for network connectivity between
various office buildings and the Secretariat, as well as for general temporary
assistance ($53,900).

29. The total resources of $1,097,500 proposed for general temporary assistance
for 2004/05 constitute a decrease of 4.7 per cent, compared with the $1,151,400
approved for 2003/04. Expenditure during 2002/03 was $568,200, with savings of
$61,800 reported as a result of the charging of temporary assistance and sick leave
to vacant posts (see A/58/703, para. 7). The Advisory Committee recalls that the use
of these resources is restricted to the provision of support during maternity or
extended sick leave and for peak workload services. The Committee found
disparities in the requests for general temporary assistance in connection with
maternity or sick leave provisions for different offices. On several occasions the
Committee has commented on the need to use this provision strictly for its intended
purpose. The Committee reiterates that resources proposed for maternity and
sick leave should be monitored for consistency and that care should be taken to
estimate requirements on the basis of past experience and a realistic assessment
of actual need. Expenditure for the support account on general temporary
assistance in 2002/03 was $568,200. Expenditure for the current period is
$712,000 for eight months as at 29 February 2004, or $89,000 per month out of
an approved total of $1,151,400. On this basis, expenditure for one year would
amount to $1,068,000. The Committee recommends an estimate of $1 million
for general temporary assistance; this represents a reduction of $97,500.

30. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, in preparing the
requirements for the support account for peacekeeping operations for 2004/05,
account had been taken of the need to ensure capacity to absorb new and expanding
missions during the period and to provide for a rapid deployment capability.

Detailed recommendations

A. Department of Peacekeeping Operations

Posts

31. The number of temporary support account posts is proposed at the same level
approved for 2003/04. The Advisory Committee was informed that of the 539 posts
currently approved for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (336
Professional and 203 General Service), as at 31 January 2004 there were 23
vacancies (22 Professional and 1 General Service). Fifteen posts have been
rejustified in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (see paras. 20-23 above).

1. Office of the Under-Secretary-General

Posts

32. Two rejustifications are submitted: a P-4 post (administrative officer) in the
office of the Director of Change Management and a P-3 post (research officer) in the
Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit (see A/58/715, paras. 25-26). Since both posts
have now been filled, the Advisory Committee has no comment to make (see
para. 21 above).

Non-post resources

33. A provision for $269,000 is proposed under consultants, an increase of
$169,000 over the provision approved for 2003/04, for outputs listed in the table in
paragraph 28 of A/58/715. The Advisory Committee questions the need to resort
to consultants to carry out two surveys of troop/police-contributing countries
on satisfaction and concerns with Department of Peacekeeping Operations
planning and support processes and on perceptions of peacekeeping
(requirements of $22,000 and $170,000, respectively). The Committee is of the
opinion, taking into account the expertise that should be available in-house,
that other modalities should be explored in order to address the need indicated
in Security Council resolution 1353 (2001). The Committee recommends
reducing the resources for consultants to $100,000 (a reduction of $169,000).

34. A provision for $353,600 is proposed for official travel, a decrease of $11,400
compared with the approved resources for 2003/04. The requirements include
$125,000 for staff exchange. The Advisory Committee notes that this provision has
been included since 2001/02, having proved useful in allowing staff to be brought
from missions to work at Headquarters for periods of three to five months for
special projects or during peak workload periods. While the Committee supports
the exchange of knowledge, which is a by-product of this practice, it trusts that
the level of travel will be monitored so as not to incur unnecessary expenditure.

Other comments and recommendations

35. The Advisory Committee notes that the Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit has
begun to function at full strength only recently. However, the Committee stresses
the need to operationalize best practices and lessons learned, through
dissemination and timely information-sharing with all relevant parts of the
United Nations system involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping



8
A/58/760

operations, thus ensuring implementation in future missions and incorporation
into policy and training exercises.

2. Office of Operations

36. The Advisory Committee enquired as to the outputs completed in relation to
expected accomplishment 3, increased efficiency and effectiveness in conducting,
managing, directing and supporting peacekeeping operations, reported in the
performance submission for 2002/03. The Committee notes that nine system-wide
task forces and working groups on peacekeeping operations were coordinated by the
Office of Operations (see A/58/703/Add.1, section II.A.1 (b)) and that eight are
projected for 2004/05. The Committee was informed that this was done in
partnership with other entities supporting a particular programme, such as the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Development
Programme. The Committee welcomes this evolution from the Integrated
Mission Task Force, which concentrates on cooperation with multiple partners
for implementation in the field.

3. Office of Mission Support

Posts

Rejustifications

37. A total of 12 posts are rejustified in the Office of Mission Support (see
A/58/715, paras. 39-44):

(a) One P-5 post in the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General;

(b) One P-4 post in the Office of the Director of the Administrative Support
Division;

(c) Four posts in the Personnel Management and Support Service (1 P-5 for
the Deputy Chief of Service, 1 P-5 for the Chief of the Civilian Training Section and
2 G-7 posts for senior human resources assistants);

(d) Two posts in the Air Transportation Section (1 P-5 for the Chief of the
Section and 1 General Service (Principal level) for a senior transport assistant);

(e) Two posts in the Communications and Information Technology Service
(1 P-5 for the Chief, Integrated Field Information Systems, and 1 P-3 for a
communications officer);

(f) Two posts in the Supply Section of the Logistics Support Division (1 P-4
for a supply officer and 1 General Service (Principal level) for an administrative
assistant).

38. The Advisory Committee notes that, at the time of its hearings, all but three of
the above-mentioned posts had been filled: the P-5 post for the Deputy Chief of the
Personnel Management and Support Service, the General Service (Principal level)
post for a senior transport assistant (Air Transportation Section) and the General
Service (Principal level) post for an administrative assistant in the Supply Section,
Logistics Support Division. The vacancy announcements for the first two posts were
being recirculated, and a recommendation for a candidate had been made regarding
the third. The functions related to those posts were performed by staff hired on a



9
A/58/760

temporary basis pending formal recruitment. The Committee was informed that a
vacancy announcement for the P-5 post of the Chief of the Air Transportation
Section would have to be recirculated, since the person who had encumbered the
post for some time had left at the time of the Committee’s hearings. The vacancy
situation in the Office of Mission Support is a cause for concern, especially
since five of the vacant positions were at the P-5 level.

Non-post resources

39. The resources proposed for travel amount to $554,600 (a decrease of $55,900,
or 9.2 per cent, relative to those approved for 2003/04). The breakdown and further
information is provided in paragraphs 51 to 58 of A/58/715. A provision for
$326,600 is included for travel related to training in rapid deployment, management,
personnel, building capacity, logistics and finance. With regard to the intention to
visit national aviation bodies as part of the air safety procedures, the Advisory
Committee believes that focal points should be agreed upon with those national
aviation authorities that have been visited previously. In future, communication with
these focal points can be carried out via e-mail and through the Permanent Missions
in New York.

40. The resources for consultants amount to $464,000 (a decrease of $31,000, or
6.3 per cent, compared with those approved for 2003/04). Details are provided in
paragraphs 45 to 50 of A/58/715. Expenditure for the reporting period 2002/03
totalled $557,200, a savings of $288,300, resulting from the fact that part of the
work originally earmarked for consultancy was carried out by staff and specialists
recruited on a short-term basis against vacant posts. The Advisory Committee
questions the need to hire a consultant to conduct a review of movement control
coordination practices. The Committee requests that in-house expertise be used
as much as possible in this connection. The Committee also questions the need
to hire a consultant to carry out a process review in the Air Transportation
Section at this time. The requirements for consultants should therefore be
reduced to $346,000 (a reduction of $118,000).

41. The Advisory Committee notes that the total resources proposed for
information technology in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations amount to
$4,602,800, a decrease of $334,600, resulting from lower requirements under
maintenance of information technology equipment. The Committee was informed
that $4,354,400 of that amount relates to the Office of Mission Support, and
includes the following: $1,163,500 for acquisition of equipment, $398,400 for
maintenance and repair of equipment and $2,792,500 for information technology
services. The resources of $987,500 for electronic data-processing equipment, which
do not include $225,000 for the acquisition of software, $317,500 for software
licences and fees and $176,000 for the purchase of spare parts and supplies, would
cover the costs of one additional item and 408 replacement items. Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that the replacement factor for personal computers in the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as well as in the whole Secretariat, is 25
per cent, in line with industry standards and best practices of the global information
and communication technologies industry.

A/58/760

4. Military Division

Posts

42. The number of support account posts is maintained at the same level as in the
previous submission — a total of 79 (61 Professional and 18 General Service). In
addition, the Military Division has four regular budget posts (2 Professional and 2
General Service). The Advisory Committee notes that of the 63 Professional posts
57 are filled by seconded military officers, who rotate on average every two to three
years, and that six posts are filled by civilian staff, who ensure institutional memory
and consistency of practice.

Non-post resources

43. The resources of $84,000 proposed for consultants include $66,000 to provide
evaluation and assessment in connection with the military or civilian police
component of four peacekeeping missions. An amount of $35,000 was approved for
this purpose in the context of the submission for 2003/04. The Advisory Committee
was informed that the increase sought was due to the plan to conduct an evaluation
in four peacekeeping missions during 2004/05, instead of two. A provision for
$18,000 is also included to review the Peacekeeping Training Manual and other
training publications. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion, however, that
the potential to review these publications in-house should be available, and that
this possibility should be explored before resorting to consultants. The
resources for consultants should be reduced to $66,000 (a reduction of $18,000).

44. The total training resources requested for 2004/05 for the Training and
Evaluation Service amount to $1,889,000 (including $18,000 for consultants,
$1,300,000 for training-related travel and $571,000 for miscellaneous supplies,
services and equipment). A breakdown of the activities proposed is presented in
annex II to the present report. The Committee recalls that an amount of $1,753,000
was requested for 2003/04 (see A/57/776, para. 52). The increase is therefore due to
additional requirements ($239,000) for training-related travel over the 2003/04
approved resources, offset by a decrease of $103,000 for consultants and
miscellaneous supplies, services and equipment. Expenditure for the reporting
period 2002/03 totalled $1,692,245, reflecting savings of $60,755, due to the
non-use of training-related consultancies and reduced requirements under related
travel.

Other comments and observations

45. The total number of outputs for the Military Division has increased from 20 in
2003/04 to 26 for 2004/05. The Advisory Committee is encouraged by the fact
that 21 of these outputs now provide measurable data, compared with only 8 in
the 2003/04 submission, which should allow better performance monitoring of
the resources allocated to the Military Division.



11

A/58/760

5. Civilian Police Division

Posts

Rejustifications

46. One post is rejustified at the P-4 level for an information management officer
to provide support in information technology. The Advisory Committee notes that
the vacancy announcement for this post was being recirculated at the time of its
hearings, since a candidate had not been identified during the reporting period (see
paras. 20-23 above).

Non-post resources

47. The increase in resources is the result of additional requirements for posts
($285,000), due to the change in standard salary costs; for consultants ($81,000), in
view of the need to develop a community police model for peacekeeping operations
and a conflict resolution course for police officers, on the basis of environments
where civilian police have been recently deployed; and for official travel ($22,200),
in view of requirements for technical support (see A/58/715, paras. 71-75).

Other comments and recommendations

48. The Advisory Committee stresses the need to keep the on-call roster up to
date in view of the needs of existing and upcoming missions. The Committee
also urges the dissemination of United Nations requirements, including for
special skills, as widely as possible. In this connection, the Committee was
informed that in order to address recent shortfalls the Division was also considering
broadening the ranks to include the use of retired police officers. This should be
done in accordance with the relevant United Nations regulations.

B. Office of the United Nations Ombudsman

49. The Advisory Committee recalls that the Office of the Ombudsman was
established in October 2002. Resources amounting to $128,200 are proposed under
the support account for the first time for this Office. The resources proposed cover
the requirements for a new P-4 post ($92,300) and non-post resources of $35,900.
The Committee was informed that during 2003, of the 405 cases handled by the
Office, 111 related to staff in peacekeeping operations. The Committee
recommends acceptance of this request.

C. Office of Internal Oversight Services

Posts

50. It is proposed to increase posts financed through the support account from 53
in the 2003/04 budget (37 Professional and 16 General Service) to 60 for 2004/05
(44 Professional and 16 General Service). The changes include the following new
support account posts:

(a) An additional P-4 post for the Internal Audit Division (New York) (see
A/58/715, para. 101);



12

A/58/760

(b) Two P-4 posts for the regional investigation teams based in Nairobi and
Vienna (ibid., para. 102);

(c) One additional General Service (Other level) post in the Executive Office
to replace general temporary assistance for which funds were approved by the
General Assembly in its resolution 57/318 (ibid., para. 103);

(d) A net increase of three posts for resident auditors, including 2 new P-5
and 3 new P-4 posts, offset by the reduction of two posts (1 P-3 and 1 General
Service (Other level)).

51. A number of redeployments are also proposed (ibid., paras. 96-99).

1. Internal Audit Division

52. A new P-4 post is proposed to be established in the Internal Audit Division, in
order to provide information technology audit coverage of peacekeeping missions,
in view of the quantity of resources invested in this area at Headquarters and in field
missions (ibid., para. 101). At the same time, a P-4 post is to be redeployed from the
Internal Audit Division to the Information Technology Unit in the Office of the
Under-Secretary-General, in order to develop and enhance information technology
systems utilized by the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ibid., para. 97). The
Advisory Committee is not convinced of the need to create a new post for a P-4
in the Internal Audit Division, at a time when another post in the same
Division, at the same level, is being proposed to be redeployed to a different
unit. The Committee does not recommend acceptance of the creation of this
post at this time.

2. Regional investigators

53. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly approved the
establishment of eight posts for regional investigators to be divided evenly between
the regional hubs in Vienna and Nairobi (1 P-4, 2 P-3 and 1 General Service (Other
level) per hub) and decided to review the posts and functions in the context of the
2004/05 budget, taking into account the workload and coverage of their activities
(see resolution 57/318, para. 15). The Committee notes the proposal to strengthen
the Vienna regional hub, increasing the number of posts to a total of eight, by
establishing an additional new P-4 post and redeploying one P-3 post from the
Internal Audit Division and two posts from the Investigations Division in New York
(1 P-5 and 1 General Service (Other level)) to provide direction and assistance (see
A/58/715, paras. 98, 99 and 102). The Nairobi hub would also be strengthened with
the addition of one new P-4 post.

54. The Advisory Committee was informed that it was too early to review the
workload and coverage of activities by the regional investigators, since it had not
been a year since this activity had been operational. However, interim information
provided to the Committee indicated that, while the staffing selection process was
under way, short-term staff had been recruited on an interim basis, thus allowing the
clearance of the backlog of approximately 100 cases and the assessment and
prioritization of new cases. From July 2003 to February 2004, 92 cases were
received, mainly in Europe (50 per cent), Africa (36 per cent) and Asia (7 per cent).
As at 29 February 2004, 87 cases were open, out of which 42 related to the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), 12 to the United



13

A/58/760

Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)
and 9 to the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE). During this
period 117 cases were reviewed, assessed and closed.

55. The rationale for the proposed increase in posts in the regional hubs is the
ability to operate two two-person teams, consisting of a P-4 and a P-3, who would
report to a P-5 in Vienna, responsible for the overall management of investigations,
direction and follow-up. The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the
request for two P-4 posts for the regional investigators as well as the proposed
redeployments. An analysis of the investigator programme should be provided
following the conclusion of the first year of its operation.

3. Executive Office

56. An additional General Service (Other level) post is proposed to regularize the
function approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 57/318, justified in
terms of the heavier workload of the Executive Office in view of the consolidation
of the peacekeeping requirements under the support account. In this connection, the
resources under general temporary assistance decrease by $60,200, reflecting the
reduction of the previously approved funds for the functions of the General Service
(Principal level) post proposed to be regularized. The Advisory Committee
recommended acceptance of the General Service (Other level) post in
paragraph 69 of A/57/776.

4. Resident auditors

57. It is proposed to treat the resident auditors as a pool, with their numbers
increasing from 27 to 30 for 2004/05, and to distribute and reallocate them
according to the budgetary size and complexity of each mission, as shown in the
table in paragraph 95 of A/58/715. Three of the resident auditor support account
posts, approved in the budget of UNMIL for 2003/04 (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 1 General
Service (Other level)), are being transferred in order to consolidate the funding of
resident auditor posts under the support account (see A/58/715, para. 95 (e)). A new
P-5 post, for a chief resident auditor, is being established in UNMIK, and a regional
Middle East audit office would be created with two new posts (1 P-5 and 1 P-4) to
oversee internal audit coverage of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL), the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), the United Nations Observer Mission in
Georgia (UNOMIG) and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) (ibid., paras. 95 (c) and (f)). The latter missions were
previously covered from New York through visits once every three years.

58. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the proposal with
regard to the pool of resident auditors and the establishment of the related new
posts. The Committee reiterates, however, that the pool in no way constitutes a
permanent number of posts, and that the number of resident auditor posts
should be adjusted as mission mandates terminate or as new missions are
approved.

Non-post resources

59. Resources for official travel amount to $807,000, an increase of $147,500
(ibid., para. 111). The Advisory Committee notes that this is due mostly to



14

A/58/760

additional requirements of the Monitoring, Evaluation and Consulting Division to
travel to peacekeeping missions in the course of evaluations to be undertaken (ibid.,
para. 113) and the travel of 20 resident auditors to Headquarters to attend a planned
workshop on the management of effective audit coverage (ibid., para. 115).
Information on evaluations, both completed and to be carried out, is included in the
Committee’s general report on peacekeeping.

60. In view of the recommendation in paragraph 52 above that the P-4 post in
the Internal Audit Division not be approved, the post resources should be
decreased to $9,063,400 (a reduction of $92,200). Non-post resources should
also be adjusted downward to $1,241,800 (a reduction of $15,400).

D. Office of Legal Affairs

61. Requirements of $30,000 for travel are included to follow up on the Office of
Internal Oversight Services recommendation, contained in its in-depth evaluation of
legal affairs (E/AC.51/2002/5), that legal officers travel to peacekeeping missions to
gain a better understanding of legal issues there. The Advisory Committee notes that
an amount of $10,000 was included in the 2002/03 budget for a trip to UNMIK.
However, as indicated in the performance report, due to the fact that coordination
efforts were not finalized before the end of the reporting period, the travel plans
were carried forward to be completed in 2003/04 (see A/58/703, para. 20). The
Committee was informed that the plan was to visit four missions during the 2004/05
period: UNMEE, MONUC, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and
UNMIK. The Committee is of the opinion that the legal officers on the scene
may well be able to communicate much of this information back to
Headquarters, thus avoiding excessive travel costs. Accordingly, the Committee
recommends that the resources for travel be reduced to $15,000.

E. Department of Public Information

62. The proposed requirements for the support account related to the Department
of Public Information are $422,800, an increase of $84,400 (24.9 per cent) over
those approved for 2003/04, as a result of the changes in salary costs for two
continuing support account posts and additional requirements for travel.

63. The Advisory Committee notes that the proposed travel resources of $53,600
provide for the travel of Department of Public Information staff to MONUC,
UNMIL, UNMEE, UNOMIG and UNMIK to work with mission personnel in
developing and improving public information strategies and activities ($32,400) and
for a one-week specialized training course to enhance participation in peacekeeping
rapid deployment teams.

64. The Advisory Committee recommends the approval of the proposed
support account resources for the Department of Public Information. The
Committee expects the Department to demonstrate a more proactive role in its
provision of support to the information elements of peacekeeping missions.



15

A/58/760

F. Department of Management

1. Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts

Posts

65. An additional P-4 post for a database administrator and a P-3 post for an
investment accountant are proposed in the Treasury Division (see A/58/715, paras.
144-145). The Advisory Committee recalls that these posts were requested in the
context of the 2003/04 submission and that the resources for the functions were
granted under general temporary assistance.

66. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the two posts
support the treasury investment database (OPICS), which has enabled the pooling of
investments in fixed-income securities and significantly increased return on
investments. The payment system (SWIFT) will be implemented in June 2004,
which will result in savings of $280,000 per annum in wire transfer fees.
Opportunities for additional savings will be created through the integration of the
Integrated Management Information System/OPICS/SWIFT cash management
system, increasing efficiency of operations, automating a substantial portion of the
bank reconciliation process and enabling savings in bank charges. The Committee
was further informed that by performing in-house the functions for the maintenance
of OPICS, $491,520 in annual outsourcing expenses would be saved. Accordingly,
the Committee recommends approval of the request for the two posts (P-4 and
P-3) for the Treasury Division.

Non-post resources

67. The resources of $460,000 for general temporary assistance reflect a decrease
of $101,500, as compared with the resources for 2003/04, mostly resulting from the
proposed conversion of the two posts proposed for the Treasury Division. The
proposed requirements include a provision for $325,400 to ensure the flow of work
and prevent the accumulation of backlogs in the processing of payments of the
Accounts Division and $74,500 for the six-month equivalent of a P-3 level post, in
order to allow the Peacekeeping Financing Division to manage additional workload
resulting from new missions, while continuing current projects and improvements.

68. The resources of $214,400 for travel constitute a decrease of $229,600
compared with the resources approved for 2003/04, in view of the non-recurrent
requirements included for training workshops held in Cyprus in July 2003. The
Advisory Committee notes that $104,100 of the proposed provision is training-
related (ibid., paras. 154-156). In this connection, the Committee was informed that
total training requirements amount to $161,000, the balance of $57,000 relating to
training fees.

Other comments and observations

69. The Advisory Committee notes that the Contributions Service and the
Accounts Division, previously included in the Office of the Under-Secretary-
General, are now consolidated into the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and
Accounts.



16

A/58/760

70. In paragraph 90 of A/57/776, the Advisory Committee requested that an
external management review of the Accounts Division be undertaken, including the
deployment of staff in the light of the use of information technology for this
function. The Committee was informed that a more comprehensive review of the
Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts was planned for 2004. The
Committee looks forward to the timely submission of conclusions of the review.
In future, time frames for the completion of such projects should be indicated
at the outset.

2. Office of Human Resources Management

Posts

71. Four new posts are proposed (see A/58/715, paras. 160-169):

(a) One P-3 post for a staff counsellor in the Division for Organizational
Development;

(b) Three posts in the Medical Services Division: 1 P-4 for a medical officer,
1 P-3 for a psychologist and 1 General Service post for a nurse.

72. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the Division of
Organizational Development, which has only one Professional staff member
currently (at the P-4 level), and no support account resources, has since mid-2003
experienced an increase in its workload, of which 30 per cent consists of requests
for counselling services and advice related to mission service. The Office provides
such services, on a confidential basis, to staff leaving for or returning from mission
service, as well as to their families. The Office considers that the services provided
have an impact on staff members’ effectiveness, productivity and ability to perform
in the field. The Committee was also informed that, while the functions do not
duplicate the work of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator, which
focuses on critical incidents and trauma of staff in the field, or that of the Medical
Services Division, which provides medical and psychological services, they
complement them. The Committee recommends acceptance of the proposal to
establish the post of staff counsellor at the P-3 level in the Division for
Organizational Development.

73. The Advisory Committee agrees with the proposal to establish the post for
a psychologist at the P-3 level, in order to assist medical officers at
Headquarters in assessing the mental health status of individuals returning
from mission assignments, and the General Service post for a nurse in the
Medical Services Division. However, the Committee is not convinced of the
need at this stage to establish the post of the medical officer at the P-4 level, in
view of the 31 current posts in the Division (15 regular budget, 10
extrabudgetary and 6 support account posts) and the additional General
Service post recommended for a nurse. Moreover, the Committee encourages
better coordination and cooperation with other medical services in the United
Nations system.

Non-post resources

74. The resources of $417,700 for consultants constitute an increase of $220,600
over the resources approved for 2003/04. The proposed amount is related to



17

A/58/760

requirements of the Division for Organizational Development, resulting from
additional programmes identified jointly by the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations and the Office of Human Resources Management to be provided in the
areas of mission readiness, performance management (including competency-based
interviewing and selection skills and the electronic Performance Appraisal System),
supervisory skills and a pilot workshop on work planning ($376,000), as well as the
continuation of work started during 2003/04 in the area of administration of justice
($38,000). The Advisory Committee was further informed that one staff
development officer (funded from the support account), in addition to managing and
developing programmes and coordinating with the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, delivers some of the training and briefings and will pilot new
programmes. However, the consultants are essential as specialists in those areas and
will develop, specifically in the area of mission readiness, a CD-ROM and online
training. The Committee has made several observations on the issue of training in its
general report on peacekeeping operations.

G. Office of Central Support Services

Posts

75. A total of five new posts are proposed for the Procurement Division (see
A/58/715, paras. 181-185):

(a) One P-5 post for the Chief of the Logistics and Transportation Section;

(b) Two P-3 posts for procurement officers;

(c) Two P-2 posts for junior procurement officers.

76. The Advisory Committee notes that the Procurement Division has an approved
total of 70 posts (37 financed under the regular budget, 29 from the support account
and 4 from technical cooperation funds). Of this total, there are three P-5 posts in
the Division, one each funded from technical cooperation funds, the support account
and the regular budget. The Committee recalls that the Commercial Procurement
and Transportation Services (predecessor of the Procurement Division) had four P-5
regular budget posts shown in the programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995,
including one transferred from conference services. That post was transferred back
to conference services during the biennium 1996-1997. Another P-5 post was
redeployed to the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for functions related to
the Committee on Contracts at Headquarters in the 1998-1999 biennium, and one
more was redeployed to the Travel and Transportation Service for the Chief of
Service, as the procurement and transportation functions were separated in the 2000-
2001 biennium, leaving a balance of one regular budget post in the Procurement
Division.

77. The Logistics and Transportation Section consists of six Professional staff (2
P-4, 3 P-3 and 1 P-2) and 10 support staff. From the information provided, upon
enquiry, the Advisory Committee notes that the value of procurement for the Section
in 2003 was in excess of 50 per cent of the procurement value of the entire Division,
primarily in support of the transportation requirements identified in the Logistics
Support Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. In view of the
responsibilities involved, the necessary capacity for rapid deployment and the
anticipated surge related to new missions, the Committee recommends the



18

A/58/760

approval of the two P-3 and two P-2 posts to strengthen the Logistics and
Transportation Section of the Procurement Division.

78. As for the P-5 post, the Advisory Committee calls attention to what is
stated in paragraph 76 above with regard to the utilization of posts at this level
in the Procurement Division. Under the circumstances, the Committee requests
that a management review of the staffing and organizational structure of the
Procurement Division in relation to all sources of financing be carried out.
Pending the results of that review, the Committee recommends that an
additional P-5 post not be established.

Rejustification

79. One General Service post (Principal level) is rejustified in the Information
Technology Services Division for a telecommunications technician. At the time of
the hearings of the Committee, the application period had been closed and the
selection process was ongoing.

Non-post resources

80. The resources of $162,000 for consultants, an increase of $154,000 over the
resources approved for 2003/04, are related to the procurement training of 150 staff,
an annual chief procurement officers’ conference and the training of 65 Security and
Safety Service personnel in VIP protection (see A/58/715, paras. 187-191). The
Advisory Committee was informed that the training requirements for 2004/05
amount to $336,000, consisting of $162,000 for consultants, $171,200 for training-
related travel and $2,800 for other supplies, services and equipment. A total of 150
staff are planned to be trained in UNMIL, the United Nations Mission in Côte
d’Ivoire (MINUCI), MONUC, UNMEE, the United Nations Logistics Base at
Brindisi, Italy, and UNFICYP.

81. The Advisory Committee expects greater efficiency and accountability to
be achieved through the training exercises. Further comments on the issue of
training are contained in its general report on peacekeeping.

82. The 99.4 per cent decrease in resources for miscellaneous supplies, services
and equipment is due mostly to the non-recurrent requirement for the procurement
training programme budgeted in 2003/04. The Advisory Committee recalls that
$572,000 was included for training during that period.

83. The resources of $447,200 for travel reflect an increase of $197,200 over the
resources approved for 2003/04, due mostly to security threat assessments to be
conducted by the Security and Safety Service during the period 2004/05 in 10
missions. The Procurement Division will conduct management review visits to
UNMIL, MINUCI, MONUC, UNMEE, UNIFIL, UNMIK, UNFICYP, MINURSO,
and the United Nations Logistics Base ($120,000).

Other comments and observations

84. The Advisory Committee requested a comprehensive examination of the merits
of establishing a global procurement hub for all peacekeeping missions at the United
Nations Logistics Base, transferring both post and non-post resources financed from
the support account at Headquarters and retaining only a few posts in New York for
policy and liaison functions (see A/57/776, para. 99). The Committee was informed



19

A/58/760

that the report was being prepared and that it would be submitted to the General
Assembly during the resumed part of its fifty-eighth session.

H. Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator

85. An amount of $1,286,800 is proposed for the Office of the United Nations
Security Coordinator, an increase of $108,000 over the resources approved for
2003/04. This is due mostly to the changes in standard salary costs and an increase
of $15,400 for official travel, relating to training of mission security management
teams and security officers, as indicated in paragraph 206 of A/58/715. The
Committee recommends approval of the support account resources proposed.

86. The Advisory Committee further notes that the Secretary-General has
submitted a report on the safety and security of United Nations staff to the General
Assembly (A/58/756), which deals with the related requirements for the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations, the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator
and the Department of Management in relation to security arrangements in
peacekeeping operations. The Committee’s comments and observations are
contained in its report on the subject (A/58/758).

VI. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

87. The action proposed to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with
the support account is indicated in paragraph 40 of the performance report for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 (A/58/703). The Advisory Committee
recommends approval of the action proposed by the Secretary-General therein.

88. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of the support account for the 12-month period from 1 July 2004 to 30
June 2005 is set out in paragraph 217 of the budget report (A/58/715).

89. In the present document, the Advisory Committee has made
recommendations for reductions that would total $814,500 gross ($749,700 net).
Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve
total staffing and non-staffing requirements of $121,278,900 gross
($104,870,200 net) for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The
Committee also recommends that miscellaneous income of $4,600,000, the
amount of $127,800 that was not applied to offset the amounts prorated among
the individual peacekeeping budgets relating to the period from 1 July 2002 to
30 June 2003 and the amount of $741,000 relating to additional staff assessment
income that was not prorated among peacekeeping missions for the period from
1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 be applied to the resources required for the period
from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, and that the balance of $116,551,100 gross
($99,401,400 net) be prorated among the individual peacekeeping operation
budgets to meet the requirements of the support account for the period from 1
July 2004 to 30 June 2005.
