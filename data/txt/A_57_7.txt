First report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction

1. The major functions of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions, as defined by the General Assembly in its resolution 14 (I) of
13 February 1946, are:

(a) To examine and report on the budget submitted by the Secretary-General
to the General Assembly;

(b) To advise the General Assembly concerning any administrative and
budgetary matters referred to it;

(c) To examine on behalf of the General Assembly the administrative
budgets of the specialized agencies and proposals for financial arrangements with
such agencies;

(d) To consider and report to the General Assembly on the auditors’ reports
on the accounts of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies.

2. In accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 14 (I),
examination of the budget by the Advisory Committee includes not only the regular
assessed budget but also extrabudgetary expenditures, as well as the financing of the
various peacekeeping operations, the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and the International Tribunal for Rwanda. Pursuant to rule 157 of the



2
A/57/7

rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the Committee shall perform such other
duties as may be assigned to it under the Financial Regulations of the United
Nations. In addition, with regard to programmes financed by voluntary funds, the
Committee reports on administrative budgets and other matters to the governing
bodies of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations
Children’s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (voluntary funds), the United Nations
Environment Programme (Environment Fund), the United Nations Habitat and
Human Settlements Foundation, the United Nations Institute for Disarmament
Research, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, the United
Nations University, the World Food Programme, the United Nations International
Drug Control Programme and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

3. Under rule 156 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the
members of the Advisory Committee, no two of whom shall be nationals of the same
State, shall be selected on the basis of broad geographical representation, personal
qualifications and experience.

4. During the reporting period, the members of the Advisory Committee were:

5. During the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, the meetings of the
Advisory Committee were organized into three sessions, held in New York: from 4
September to 21 December 2001; from 5 February to 5 April 2002; and from 7 to 24
May 2002. The Committee also met in Geneva from 27 to 30 May, in The Hague on
3 and 4 June, in Arusha on 6 and 7 June, in Asmara on 9 and 10 June, in Assab,
Eritrea, on 11 June, in Addis Ababa on 12 and 13 June, in Nairobi on 17 and 18 June
and in Paris on 21 June 2002. The present report presents general observations and
relates in factual terms the matters that were before the Committee at the various
locations away from Headquarters (see annex I).

6. Under the terms of General Assembly resolutions 49/233 A of 23 December
1994 on peacekeeping operations and 52/223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen
and extraordinary expenses, in accordance with existing procedures, the Advisory
Committee replied to various requests of the Secretary-General by letter during the
fifty-sixth session of the Assembly. In most cases, the Committee authorized the



3
A/57/7

Secretary-General to enter into commitments to undertake various peacekeeping
operations. A list of the Committee’s letters to the Secretary-General is contained in
annex II to the present report.

II. General observations

7. The comments and recommendations of the Advisory Committee reached
during the meetings it held in New York are contained in the reports it submits to the
General Assembly and other legislative bodies (see annex II below). The detailed
comments and recommendations of the Committee on the meetings it held away
from Headquarters will be submitted to the Assembly at its fifty-seventh and fifty-
eighth sessions in the context of the specific reports the Committee will be issuing
on related matters, including proposals of the Secretary-General relating to the
regular budget of the United Nations, peacekeeping operations and the International
Tribunals. In the present report, the Committee therefore confines itself to general
observations.

8. In the course of its meetings held away from Headquarters, the Advisory
Committee sought information on the effects of across-the-board budget cuts on the
activities of the entities it visited. In many instances, the Committee was informed
that budget cuts had necessitated a halt or paring down of planned improvements
and innovations in the area of information technology. The Committee expresses its
concern that delays in the implementation of these activities could have a negative
impact on efforts to improve efficiency and, in the longer term, to achieve savings.

9. The Advisory Committee once again stresses the desirability of coordination
among the specialized agencies in such areas as security, printing and procurement.
The Committee notes and welcomes the establishment of the Management
Ownership Committee, which is composed of the executive heads of Geneva-based
organizations, and the Common Services Task Force in Geneva. It also
acknowledges the work done under the auspices of the High-level Committee on
Management of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination
to establish cost-sharing arrangements for the Office of the United Nations Security
Coordinator. However, the Committee found little evidence of coordination among
the agencies in the area of security in Geneva proper, nor does there seem to be
much coordination in printing services. It welcomes, however, the information
provided to it that the United Nations Office at Geneva coordinates a common
purchasing service for information technology supplies and services, which is open
to all agencies. In Nairobi, joint arrangements are in place for, among other things,
security, medical, information technology, printing and legal services, with the
United Nations Office at Nairobi providing the bulk of such services to the agencies
in Nairobi. Furthermore, the Committee notes the establishment of the Inter-Agency
Administrative Coordination Committee, which provides a mechanism for feedback
and consultation between the Office and client agencies in Nairobi.

10. The Advisory Committee notes that building projects are planned or are in
progress for the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Health
Organization, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Office
at Nairobi. The Committee cautions against undertaking costly long-term
construction projects, which, when completed, may not accommodate all staff.
Growth patterns in staffing should be taken into account and the possibility of



4
A/57/7

subletting space that is in excess of current needs should be explored when planning
such projects.

11. Delegation of authority and the granting of increased flexibility to programme
managers continue to be issues of concern throughout the system. The Advisory
Committee notes, for example, that the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed concern regarding the fact that as an
integral part of the United Nations Secretariat it does not have delegated financial
authority and therefore all requests for allotments must be channelled through the
United Nations Office at Geneva, at times causing delays in funding that are
perceived as diminishing the operational effectiveness of the Office. The Committee
maintains the view that the key to effective delegation is a concomitant
reinforcement of accountability.

12. The Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) believes that there is lack of
transparency in the allocation and use by the United Nations Office at Geneva of
resources that have been approved for administration and conference and general
services at ECE. The issuance of allotments to the United Nations Office at Geneva
and budgetary control are carried out directly by United Nations Headquarters
against approved ECE resources. According to ECE, the current working
arrangements with the United Nations Office at Geneva do not provide incentives to
programme managers at the Commission to achieve savings under those objects of
expenditure. ECE would prefer to obtain services directly on a competitive basis
from various potential service providers, including the United Nations Office at
Geneva.

13. The Advisory Committee notes with interest the steps taken by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in its development of a
table of financial authority for its headquarters and its plans to develop a similar
table for the field.

14. The Advisory Committee has noted that the International Tribunals are
experiencing a number of human resources problems. Among these has been the
lengthy periods required for the advertisement of vacancy announcements and the
consequent delays in recruitment. In the opinion of the Committee, greater
flexibility for entities with limited mandates should help to address this problem.
The Committee was informed that the new staff selection system (see ST/AI/2002/4)
would provide some flexibility in this regard. The Committee intends to follow up
on this issue when it considers the budgets of the Tribunals and the peacekeeping
operations. The Committee also notes with concern the increasing trend of
transferring experienced staff from established field missions to start-up missions,
leaving a void of expertise in the established missions.

15. The Advisory Committee notes that the International Tribunal for Rwanda has
opted not to apply, for the time being, some aspects of the new human resources
policies adopted by the General Assembly that would permit personnel recruited by
the Tribunal after May 2002 to apply as internal candidates for vacancies in the
system. It is the view of the Tribunal that problems could ensue as a result of the
different treatment of staff hired prior to May 2002.

Annex I
Meetings of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions

I. Meetings held in New York

1. During its sessions in New York, the Advisory Committee considered a
number of reports related to the United Nations regular budget, United Nations
peacekeeping operations and other administrative and budgetary matters of the
United Nations and its funds and programmes. In the course of its consideration of
the reports, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General and of
the executive heads of funds and programmes. The reports of the Committee are
listed in annex II.

II. Meetings held away from Headquarters

A. United Nations Office at Geneva and programmes and agencies
in Geneva

2. The Advisory Committee’s discussions with representatives of the United
Nations Office at Geneva on 27 May 2002 focused on central support services and
other operations of the Office, including matters related to security initiatives
implemented in 2002, cooperation in common services (e.g., travel services,
electricity rates, information technology and cleaning services), office space and
facility management. The Committee was also briefed on the status of budget
implementation, in particular on the impact of General Assembly resolutions
56/254 A to C of 24 December 2001; on electronic services and matters related to
the Integrated Management Information System; on human resources management
issues, such as recruitment time, administration of justice, the staff selection system
and monitoring mechanisms; and on conference servicing issues, such as
technological innovations, précis writing and the scarcity of qualified language staff.

3. On 28 May 2002, a joint meeting was held with representatives of the
International Telecommunication Union, the World Health Organization, the
International Labour Organization, the World Meteorological Organization and the
World Intellectual Property Organization. Discussions centred on inter-agency
cooperation in Geneva in such areas as security, printing, procurement, building
construction, management, maintenance, Joint Inspection Unit management studies
and the functioning of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for
Coordination.

4. On 29 May 2002, the Advisory Committee met with the Deputy High
Commissioner for Human Rights and other representatives of the Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights. The Committee was briefed on action taken to
implement a number of its recommendations on issues such as the management of
extrabudgetary posts, projections of extrabudgetary resources and the consistency
with the medium-term plan of activities funded from extrabudgetary resources in the
light of the increase in contributions to human rights activities from extrabudgetary
sources; the system of rapporteurs and the attendant publication workload; and the



6
A/57/7

development of indicators of achievement of expected accomplishments. The
following issues were also discussed: the working arrangements of the Office with
the Department of Management and the United Nations Office at Geneva, in
particular the fact that the Office, as part of the United Nations Secretariat, does not
have delegated financial authority; measures taken by the Office to regularize
situations where permanent functions are being carried out using general temporary
assistance funds; progress with regard to the proposal by the Secretary-General to
rationalize human rights bodies; and the impact of cuts in the regular budget for
2002-2003 relating to the work of the Office.

5. On 29 May 2002, the Advisory Committee exchanged views with the
Inspectors of the Joint Inspection Unit on matters of mutual interest and discussed
the programme of work of the Unit.

6. The Advisory Committee met with the Executive Secretary and other
representatives of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) on 30 May 2002.
The Committee was informed that the social sector would be strengthened in the
Commission’s work programme, with priority areas of work to include ageing and
gender, while areas such as transport, trade and, to a certain extent, environmental
matters would be de-emphasized. The representatives of ECE discussed the
Commission’s current working arrangements with the United Nations Office at
Geneva and the allocation and use by the Office of resources that have been
approved for ECE for administration and conference and general services, as well as
the Commission’s need for more flexibility in the implementation of its budget, in
particular in the use of resources budgeted for posts. The representatives of ECE
reported that budget cuts for the biennium 2002-2003 had negatively affected the
Commission’s programme of work in a number of areas, most notably information
technology, communications, the translation and production of publications, travel
and the maintenance of statistical databases. Finally, the Committee was informed
that further progress had been made in refining expected accomplishments and
indicators of achievement for the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2004-2005 to be able to link outputs more closely with the objectives set out in the
medium-term plan.

7. The Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on 30 May 2002. The
Committee was briefed on a number of issues, including the UNHCR operations in
Afghanistan and Eritrea. UNHCR has overall coordinating responsibility in respect
of the provision of assistance to internally displaced persons in Afghanistan. Among
other factors affecting the work of UNHCR in Afghanistan is the funding of
shortfalls facing key assistance partners. With regard to the voluntary repatriation of
Eritreans from the Sudan, the Committee was informed that a total of 47,000 people
had been assisted to return home out of a targeted 160,000 for the period from May
2001 to December 2002. On the issue of programme funding, UNHCR projects an
income shortfall of $98.7 million. For 2003, given the special situation of the
Afghanistan operation, UNHCR plans to set up the requirements of the operation
outside the annual programme budget. The Committee was also briefed on air
operations and on measures taken to improve the management of security and to
enhance the safety of both staff and refugees in field operations.

A/57/7

B. International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, International
Tribunal for Rwanda and International Court of Justice

8. The briefings in The Hague on the operations of the International Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia on 3 June included presentations by the President of the
Tribunal, the Prosecutor and the Deputy Prosecutor, the Registrar and other senior
staff of the Tribunal. The Tribunal’s completion strategy and the related issues of
judicial reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina and criteria and procedures for the future
referral of cases to national courts were discussed in some detail. The Committee
was informed that the Office of the Prosecutor had 25 remaining investigations to
complete by the end of 2003, which could result in 30 new indictments involving
approximately 100 accused. It is envisioned that by the end of 2004, cases involving
50 of those 100 accused might be remitted to national courts. What role the Tribunal
would play in the local courts was, as yet, unclear; the procedures were being
discussed. The Kosovo model, using international judges, was one option. The
Committee was informed that six trials were being conducted concurrently in the
Tribunal. The need for 2 additional preparatory teams, for a total of 12, was
discussed. The goal was to have six trials fully prepared so that when the current
trials were completed, six new ones could begin immediately. The Committee was
also informed of the planned establishment of a bar association and amendment of
the code of professional conduct to include a disciplinary regime and provisions on
fee-splitting and conflict of interest. Among other issues discussed was the vast
amount of documentation that must be translated and prospective solutions to the
delays this requirement has contributed to.

9. On 4 June 2002, the Advisory Committee exchanged views with the Prosecutor
for the International Tribunal for Rwanda, who is based in The Hague and who also
serves concurrently as the Prosecutor for the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia. Discussions centred on the difficulties being encountered in securing the
cooperation of Governments in tracking and apprehending suspects and obtaining
documentation; the full docket of the three trial chambers and the use of joint trials
and a “twin-tracking” system, whereby each trial chamber is adjudicating two trials
in rotation; the need for ad litem judges; and the large number of vacant posts in the
Tribunal.

10. On 4 June 2002, the Advisory Committee also met with members of the
International Court of Justice and its Registrar at the Peace Palace in The Hague and
discussed various issues of concern to the Committee and the Court. As regards the
workload of the Court, the Committee was informed that 24 cases were currently
pending; however, it was difficult to forecast workload, as the Court had no control
over the number and timing of new proceedings. New cases are brought before the
Court by Member States and advisory opinions are requested by the United Nations
and its specialized agencies without prior notice to the Court. Conversely, the parties
can withdraw cases at any moment. The Committee was informed that the Court was
taking steps to improve its working methods, in particular through the introduction
of information technologies. The representatives of the Court reported that its web
site continued to be very successful (some 225,000 copies of its judgements are
downloaded and some 140,000 persons use the web site yearly); however, budget
cuts approved by the General Assembly for the biennium 2002-2003 had affected
the provision of services by the Registry in several administrative support areas,
including information technology, communications, travel, contractual services and
equipment.

A/57/7

C. International Tribunal for Rwanda

11. On 6 and 7 June 2002, the Advisory Committee met in Arusha with the
President of the International Tribunal for Rwanda and other judges, the Registrar
and senior staff of the Office of the Prosecutor (see also para. 9 above) and other
representatives of the Tribunal. On 7 June, the Committee also visited the United
Nations Detention Facility in Arusha. On the subject of courtroom scheduling and
the workload of the chambers, the Committee was informed that there were nine
trials in progress, three in each of the chambers. The judges reported that a great
deal of time was spent hearing motions and cited the need to act preventively to
avoid excessive motions. Weekly meetings with the parties had been instituted for
this purpose and had proven effective. The concept of twin-tracking, which the
Committee had expressed concern about previously (see A/56/666), was also
discussed.

12. On personnel matters, the Advisory Committee was briefed on measures being
taken to address the continuing high vacancy rate in the Tribunal. Among other
things, the representatives of the Tribunal stressed the urgent need for revisers in the
Tribunal and highlighted the difficulties encountered in attracting language staff
because of the low post levels offered to them at the Tribunal compared with
elsewhere in the system. Other issues discussed included the legal aid system, the
enforcement of sentences, the question of witnesses who are brought to the Tribunal
but do not testify and the related expenses, and court management.

D. United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea

13. On 9 and 10 June 2002, the Advisory Committee met in Asmara with the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and his senior staff and was briefed
on the operations of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE),
as well as on progress made in the peace process. The Chief Administrative Officer
and his senior colleagues briefed the Committee on the main administrative,
personnel, budgetary, logistical and general service issues, including recruitment
efforts to fill vacancies and the high turnover rate for international staff in UNMEE,
as well as on the UNMEE civilian medical support system. On 9 June the
Committee also met at the United Nations Development Programme compound with
the United Nations organizations in Asmara and visited the Mine Action
Coordination Centre. The Committee was informed that more than 180,000
internally displaced persons and more than 30,000 refugees had been assisted by the
international community to return to their areas of origin. However, a large number
of internally displaced persons were unable to return to their homes because of
minefields and unexploded ordnance. Agencies and humanitarian programmes
continued to assist in reconstruction activities, and quick-impact projects were an
important element of this assistance. The Committee was informed that some
$700,000 had been approved for 64 such projects. On 10 June, the Committee
visited the integrated warehouses and the water purification and bottling plants.

14. On 11 June 2002, the Advisory Committee visited the Sector East headquarters
of UNMEE and the Slovak engineering/demining company in Assab. The
Committee also visited the Kenyan battalion at point 60, where it was briefed on the
new accommodation arrangements provided by the United Nations.

15. On 12 June 2002, the Advisory Committee was briefed by UNMEE senior staff
members in Addis Ababa on human rights and the military and administrative



9
A/57/7

components of the Mission in Addis Ababa and toured the new premises. UNMEE
was formerly housed in containers located on the ECA premises.

E. Economic Commission for Africa

16. On 12 and 13 June 2002, the Advisory Committee met in Addis Ababa with
the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa and his senior
programme managers. A number of issues were discussed, including the role and
effectiveness of the subregional development centres and potential duplication in the
work of the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General in the region and the
centres; the Commission’s information technology modernization project; progress
in the development of the web site; efforts to reduce the number of publications
issued by the Commission; steps taken to reduce the ratio of General Service to
Professional staff and to lower the vacancy rates for Professional staff; and
management of the United Nations Conference Centre.

F. United Nations Office at Nairobi, United Nations Environment
Programme and United Nations Human Settlements Programme

17. At its meetings on 17 June 2002 with representatives of the United Nations
Office at Nairobi, the Advisory Committee was briefed on the challenges of Nairobi
as a duty station, the integrated budget of the Division of Administrative Services,
the United Nations common services project in Kenya and security and conference
servicing issues. The Committee was informed that a common services project had
been launched in 2000-2001 that included joint arrangements for, among other
things, security, medical, information technology and legal services. At present,
most services were provided by the United Nations Office at Nairobi to the other
agencies in Nairobi. The Inter-Agency Administrative Coordination Committee
provides a forum for discussion between the Office and its clients.

18. In response to its enquiry concerning the effects of budget cuts on the Office,
the Advisory Committee was informed that, as outsourced contacts had to be paid,
budget cuts, of necessity, were made in virtually every other area. Information
technology was an area that had been particularly affected. The Committee was
briefed on the proposal to construct additional office space to be financed through a
loan from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The aim was to
establish a United Nations house to accommodate all United Nations personnel in
the same compound. At present, 1,600 staff are in the United Nations complex and
600 are elsewhere in Nairobi.

19. On the issue of cooperation in conference services, the Advisory Committee
was informed that the United Nations Office at Nairobi had an agreement, which
would be formalized shortly, to assist the Economic Commission for Africa with
conference services when needed. In addition, the Office was actively cooperating
with conference services in the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and both the
Commission and the Tribunal used the printing services of the United Nations
Office at Nairobi.

20. On human resources issues, the Advisory Committee was informed that the
average time required to recruit staff for the United Nations Office at Nairobi was
six months and that the Office had managed to achieve a relatively low vacancy rate
through temporary recruitment.



10

A/57/7

21. On 18 June 2002, the Advisory Committee met with the Deputy Executive
Director of UNEP and other UNEP officials. The Committee was briefed on the
activities and programme of work of UNEP, including preparations for its
participation in the World Summit on Sustainable Development (which was held in
Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September 2002). The composition and role of
the UNEP governing bodies and the organizational structure of the UNEP secretariat
and outposted offices were also discussed in some detail. The Committee was
informed of a revised financial framework for UNEP for the biennium 2002-2003 as
at 15 June 2002 showing projected income under the Environment Fund to be
significantly lower than originally estimated in the budget proposal.

22. Also on 18 June, a team of senior managers of the United Nations Human
Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) provided the Advisory Committee with an
overview of the mission and objectives of the Programme and discussed its
strengthened mandate and new status, as a result of the adoption by the General
Assembly of its resolution 56/206 of 21 December 2001, as a programme of the
United Nations. The Committee was briefed on the activities of UN-Habitat in such
areas as post-conflict reconstruction, sustainable urbanization, secure tenure and
urban governance. The proposed revised medium-term plan for UN-Habitat, the role
of its governing body, the funding mechanisms and instruments of information-
sharing with Governments and partners were also discussed.

G. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization

23. The Advisory Committee met with representatives of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at its headquarters in
Paris. Discussions focused on the status of implementation of results-based
management; evaluation mechanisms, oversight and accountability; personnel policy
reform; and implementation of the new finance and budget system. The Committee
was informed that a college of Assistant Directors-General had been established by
the Director-General as an informal policy-debating body to review, every six
months, the implementation of programmes focusing on the use of resources and the
need for eventual reallocation, as well as the attainment of expected results. The
Committee was also informed that efforts towards greater delegation of authority
were under way; a table of financial authority had been completed for UNESCO
headquarters, and a similar table was planned for the field offices. On the subject of
the finance and budget system, it was reported that the system was an adaptation of
a commercially available software package that would be used to manage all
financial and material resources needed for programme delivery and to record all
transactions and bring them to account. There would also in future be a component
for the management of human resources and payroll. The Committee was briefed on
human resources reform in UNESCO and the restructuring of the secretariat at
headquarters, including the reduction of posts at the D-1 level and above.
