Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations

Implementation of paragraph 3 of General Assembly
resolution 57/323

Peacekeeping Reserve Fund

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the note by the Secretary-General on the implementation of paragraph 3
of General Assembly resolution 57/323 (A/58/723) and the report of the Secretary-
General on the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund (A/58/724).

Implementation of paragraph 3 of General Assembly
resolution 57/323

2. By its resolution 57/323 of 18 June 2003, the General Assembly requested the
Secretary-General to return 50 per cent of the net cash available for credit to
Member States as at 30 June 2002, in the amount of $84,446,000, by 30 June 2003
and decided to postpone the return of the remaining 50 per cent until 31 March 2004
in respect of the fund balances of the United Nations peacekeeping operations listed
in paragraph 1 of the note by the Secretary-General (A/58/723).

3. The Advisory Committee notes from the table in paragraph 2 of that note that
the net cash available for credit to Member States from those operations, as at 29
February 2004, amounts to $57.4 million. However, loans totalling $152 million
were made between 30 June 2003 and 29 February 2004 as the result of significant
cash shortages in the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda owing to the non-payment of assessed contributions, which threatened
the viability of those operations (ibid., para. 3).

A/58/732

4. The Advisory Committee was provided with information on the amounts
received andd outstanding for the International Tribunals, as at 29 February 2004
(see annex I below). The Committee was also provided with information on closed
peacekeeping missions with cash deficits as at 30 June 2003 (see annex II below).

5. The cash available in the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund as at 29 February 2004
amounts to $74 million. This plus the $57.4 million currently available in the special
accounts of closed missions (see para. 3 above) totals $131.4 million.

6. In this connection, information was provided to the Advisory Committee
concerning projected cash requirements for peacekeeping missions from March to
September 2004. Three missions were expected to start up by June 2004 — in Côte
d’Ivoire, Haiti and the Sudan — each of which would require a pre-mandate
commitment authority of $50 million, with the result that the Peacekeeping Reserve
Fund would reach maximum utilization.

7. The Advisory Committee was informed that budget for the United Nations
Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) would be submitted to the General Assembly at
its resumed fifty-eighth session, in May 2004. Assessment notices would be sent in
July. The mission in the Sudan is expected to be large and it is anticipated that there
will be a need for additional interim funding above $50 million, which would
require the approval of the Assembly. A budget for the mission will be submitted to
the Assembly in September 2004. For Haiti, a budget will also be submitted in
September 2004. For all of these, the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund and/or borrowing
from closed missions will be necessary for financing until assessments begin to be
paid.

8. The Advisory Committee was further informed that, in addition, extension of
the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) may be
authorized by the end of April 2004. In that case, interim funding would be required
for the period from July to December 2004 until a revised budget for the period
2004/05 is submitted in September. The Committee was informed that the balance in
the special account for UNMISET would be used for that purpose; however, June
and September payments to troop-contributing countries for troop costs and
contingent-owned equipment might have to be postponed in order to conserve cash
until assessed contributions come in.

9. The above scenarios do not include potential developments in respect of
Cyprus and Burundi. Because of the fragile financial situation outlined above and
the fact that assessed contributions normally take from 45 to 60 days to start to come
in, the cash available in closed missions would be required as a buffer to supplement
the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund.

10. It is indicated in paragraph 6 of the note by the Secretary-General that
prudence dictates that the return to Member States of the amount of $84,446,000,
representing 50 per cent of the net cash available for credit to Member States as at
30 June 2002, be postponed; the Secretary-General proposes that this issue be
revisited at the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly in the autumn of 2004.

11. In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the postponement of the return
of “available cash” to Member States is a policy decision to be determined by
the General Assembly.

A/58/732

12. However, the Advisory Committee points out that cash from closed
missions appears to be the only source that can be used for temporary cross-
borrowing when the International Tribunals or active peacekeeping operations
run out of cash. Cash from closed missions is also a source of funding for new
missions, in addition to the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund (see para. 16 below).
Borrowing from active missions is not permitted under General Assembly
resolutions (see, for example, Assembly resolution 57/335, para. 23); the use of
the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund is restricted to the purposes set out in
Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994 (see para. 13 below).

Peacekeeping Reserve Fund

13. The report of the Secretary-General (A/58/724) provides information on the
status of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund. The Advisory Committee recalls that the
General Assembly, in its resolution 47/217 of 23 December 1992, created a
Peacekeeping Reserve Fund as a cash-flow mechanism to ensure the rapid response
of the Organization to the needs of peacekeeping operations, and decided that the
level of the Fund should be $150 million. The Assembly, in its resolution 49/233 A,
decided to limit the utilization of the Fund to the start-up phase of new
peacekeeping operations, to the expansion of existing ones or to unforeseen and
extraordinary expenditures related to peacekeeping.

14. As indicated in the audited financial statements for the 12-month period from 1
July 2002 to 30 June 2003, the level of the Fund, as at 30 June 2003, was $194.3
million. Of that amount, $33.3 million was transferred to the support account for
peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 under the
terms of General Assembly resolution 57/317 of 18 June 2003, leaving an amount of
$161.0 million.

15. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report that, as at 29
February 2004, the fund balance was $163.0 million, consisting of available cash
($74 million), loans to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic
($13 million), which are still outstanding, and loans to the United Nations Mission
in Liberia ($76 million) for its start-up requirements.

16. The Secretary-General indicates that it is vital that the Fund be maintained at
its current authorized level (ibid., para.7). As noted in paragraphs 6 to 9 above, the
Peacekeeping Reserve Fund will be required to meet the immediate cash
requirements of UNOCI, UNMISET and other potential missions. The Advisory
Committee notes from paragraph 6 of the report that the level of the strategic
deployment stocks would not be adequate to meet all those requirements. Upon
enquiry, the representatives of the Secretary-General indicated that increasing the
level of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund would require a separate decision by the
General Assembly and a separate assessment, which, with the current pattern of
payments, would not address short-term liquidity requirements. The Committee is
of the view that an increase in the level of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund
would have little or no impact on the short-term cash-flow problem, which can
be solved only by an improved pattern of payment of assessed contributions.

17. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
Peacekeeping Reserve Fund is indicated in paragraph 8 of the report. The Advisory
Committee recommends acceptance of the proposals of the Secretary-General

A/58/732

to maintain the level of the Fund at $150 million and that the balance in excess
of the authorized level of the Fund, namely $11.047 million, be applied to meet
the financing of the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period
from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005.
