  Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions** 
 
 

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has 
considered the report of the Executive Director on the proposed revised budget for 
the biennium 2002-2003 and the proposed outline for the biennium 2004-2005 for 
the Fund of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme 
(E/CN.7/2003/15). During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee 
exchanged views with the Executive Director and other senior officials of the 
United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), who provided 
additional information.  

2. The report of the Executive Director contains the proposals for the revised 
support and programme budgets for the biennium 2002-2003 and the budget outline 
for the biennium 2004-2005. The revised support budget for the biennium 2002-
2003 amounts to $34,243,500, reflecting a nominal decrease of $1,142,900, or 
3.3 per cent, compared with the initial support budget for the biennium 2002-2003 
of $35,386,600. The revised budget for the biennium 2002-2003 includes a proposed 
volume decrease of $1,484,200, or 4.2 per cent, and cost changes of $341,300, or 
1 per cent, compared with the initial budget for the biennium 2002-2003 
(E/CN.7/2003/15, table 5).

3. As indicated in paragraph 29 and annex I of document E/CN.7/2003/15, the 
total number of posts under the revised support budget for the biennium 2002-2003 
would be increased from 203 to 205 posts. The proposa1 includes the creation of a 
programme management officer post at the P-4 level and a national programme 
officer post for the Country Office in Afghanistan. At the field level, the number of 
posts would be consequently increased from 113 to 115. In addition, it is proposed 
to upgrade the post of Project Coordinator for the Regional Centre in Thailand from 
P-2 to P-3. At headquarters, the total post requirements would remain at 90 (41 for 
programme support and 49 for management and administration). The Advisory 
Committee has no objection to these proposals.  

4. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in paragraph 5 of its report 
(E/CN.7/2001/18), it indicated that the current practice of presenting revised 
estimates with the proposed outline should be eliminated, unless there were 
substantial increases or changes in the operations of the programme and the support 
budget, requiring considerable revision. As indicated above, the Committee notes 
that the present revised estimates for the support budget for the biennium 2002-2003 
show a downward revision of $1.1 million, or 3.3 per cent, compared with the initial 
support budget. In addition, the Committee observes that the Executive Director is 
authorized to transfer resources in the support budget between appropriation lines 
up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the appropriation to which the resources are 
redeployed. Under the circumstances, the Committee reiterates its recommendation 
to eliminate the current practice of presenting revised estimates for the support 
budget, in conjunction with the presentation of the outline, if there are no 
substantial increases or changes in the operation of the programme and support 
budget that would require considerable revision.  

5. The outline for the biennium 2004-2005 is presented in part four of the report. 
The outline amounts to $170.9 million for the biennium 2004-2005, compared with 
the revised budget for the biennium 2002-2003 of $166.4 million, reflecting an 
increase of $4.5 million, or 2.7 per cent (E/CN.7/2003/15, para. 51 and table 8). The 
Committee notes that the outline for the biennium 2004-2005 is based on current 
best estimates of overall income trends and that the total increase assumed takes 
into account overall inflation and exchange rate fluctuations (E/CN.7/2003/15, 
para. 7). The outline would be allocated in accordance with the categories identified 
in the harmonized budget model, namely programme ($132.2 million), programme 
support ($28.3 million) and management and administration ($10.4 million). 
Allocations to programme activities would be in accordance with the operational 
priorities summarized in paragraph 9 of the report.  

6. The Advisory Committee notes that it is stated in paragraphs 18-23 of the 
report of the Executive Director (E/CN.7/2003/15), on the financial situation of 
UNDCP, that the Programme faces both a cash-flow and a structural problem in the 
financing of activities. Options for securing assured and predictable funding are 
discussed in paragraphs 26 and 27 of the report. The Committee notes the 
involvement of the private sector under options for alternative financing 
(E/CN.7/2003/15, para. 26 (b) (vi)) and under other options proposed by UNDCP or 
by Member States, as shown in the summary of the comments from the open-ended 
working group on predictable financing (E/CN.7/2003/15, para. 27, sect. C, 
option 1). In this connection, the Committee trusts that every effort would be made 
to ensure that any income from the private sector would be used in a manner that

does not in any way compromise the international character and integrity of the 
Programme. To that end, the Committee recommends close coordination with the 
World Health Organization, with a view to profiting from its experiences and 
lessons learned in this regard.  

7. The Advisory Committee was briefed by the Executive Director on his plans to 
reform and reorganize the Programme, including by making it more field-oriented 
while improving the geographical distribution and gender balance and reducing the 
age profile. The Executive Director informed the Committee of steps taken to 
reduce the top-heaviness of the secretariat and streamline operations with a view to 
increasing efficiency and productivity. The Committee was provided with a 
document containing the results of an assessment of the strength and shortcomings 
of the operation of the Programme.  

8. The Advisory Committee commends the Executive Director for the initiatives 
he has taken. It notes in particular the importance he attaches to the implementation 
of six new operational priorities1 and guidelines for the medium term with a view to 
improving governance, funding, operational management, communications and staff 
management relations. The Committee requests that, in his next budget submission, 
the Executive Director provide information on how the implementation of the 
operational priorities have affected the organization and programme structure of 
UNDCP. The Committee also requests that the Executive Director indicate in his 
next budget submission the policy areas, particularly on the subject of governance, 
where further guidance is needed. 

9. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee requests that the Executive Director 
include in his next budget presentation a clear statement of the deployment and use 
of all resources for staffing and programmes, both approved and proposed, for 
counter-terrorism activities under the aegis of the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime.2 

10. Subject to the above observations, the Committee recommends approval of the 
revised budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003 and the proposed outline for 
the biennium 2004-2005.
