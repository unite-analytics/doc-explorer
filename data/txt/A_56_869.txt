Programme budget implications of draft resolution
A/C.3/56/L.84/Rev.1

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/56/38), in
accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, of the
budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.84/Rev.1.

2. Operative paragraphs 12,13 and 14 of draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.84/Rev.1 are
quoted in paragraph 1 of the Secretary-General’s statement.

3. As indicated in paragraph 2 of the statement, the requests contained in
operative paragraphs 12,13 and 14 of draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.84/Rev.1 are
associated with programme 19, Human rights, of the medium-term plan for the
period 2002-2005 and to section 22, Human rights, of the programme budget for the
biennium 2002-2003.

4. Activities by which the proposed requests would be implemented are contained
in paragraph 3 of the Secretary-General’s statement and provide for, inter alia, the
following:

(a) Establishment of the Anti-Discrimination Unit, which would include
three Professional posts (one P-5 and two P-3) and one General Service post;

(b) Convening of three meetings of five independent eminent experts (two
meetings in 2002 and one meeting in 2003, all at Geneva);

A/56/869

(c) Convening of five regional expert meetings (two meetings in 2002, in
Latin America and Africa, and three meetings in 2003, for Asia, Eastern Europe and
States that are members of the Group of Western European and Other States).

5. The modification that would be required to the narrative of section 22 of the
programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 is indicated in paragraph 4 of the
Secretary-General’s statement. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the
modification provides the necessary degree of detail with regard to the reference to
the outcome of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance approved in paragraph 67 of annex I to General
Assembly resolution 56/253.

6. The Committee requested and was provided with information on the
provisional structure of the Anti-Discrimination Unit and on the breakdown of the
cost of five regional meetings. (See the annexes to the present report.)

7. The Committee was informed that the status of voluntary contributions to the
World Conference is as follows: contributions amount to $7,902,461 and
expenditures to $7,621,840, leaving a balance of $280,621.

8. As shown in the table in paragraph 5 of the statement, total requirements
would amount to $1,178,700, of which $1,074,800 would be required under section
22, Human rights, and $103,900 would be required under section 32, Staff
assessment (to be offset by an equivalent amount under income section 1, Income
from staff assessment) of the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.

9. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform
the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.84/Rev.1,
expenditures would arise not exceeding $1,074,800 under section 22, Human
rights, and $103,900 under section 32, Staff assessment (to be offset by an
equivalent amount under income section 1, Income from staff assessment) of
the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003; additional appropriations
would be considered by the Assembly in accordance with the procedures set out
in resolutions 41/213 and 42/211 for the use and operation of the Contingency
Fund. However, in view of the fact that the draft resolution is proposed for
adoption in March 2002, the activities to be implemented immediately
thereafter, it will be necessary to authorize commitment in the recommended
amount at the current part of the resumed session. Such additional
appropriation as may be required would then be considered at the main part of
the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.

10. The Advisory Committee also recommends that, whenever possible,
efforts should be made to supplement the work of the Anti-Discrimination Unit,
and other activities relating to the follow-up to the Conference, with voluntary
contributions.
