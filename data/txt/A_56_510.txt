Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces
in the Middle East: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon

United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the proposed budget for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) for the 12-month period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (A/56/431).
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with
representatives of the Secretary-General and the Officer-in-charge of the mission,
who provided additional information.

2. UNIFIL was established by the Security Council in its resolution 425 (1978) of
19 March 1978 for operations in southern Lebanon. The mission’s mandate has been
extended several times by the Council, most recently in its resolution 1365 (2001) of
31 July 2001, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force until 31
January 2002.

3. The Advisory Committee recalls that the Controller, in his letter dated 22
March 2001, informed the Committee that recent and prospective anticipated
developments specific to certain peacekeeping missions (including UNIFIL) would
likely affect their mandates, operational concepts, scope and scale of activities and
related resource requirements. The Controller therefore requested that the Advisory
Committee recommend to the General Assembly, as an interim measure, the
granting of commitment authorization with an assessment in the amount of $99.5
million gross for the maintenance of UNIFIL for the period from 1 July to 31
December 2001, pending submission of the detailed UNIFIL budget to the General
Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.

4. On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee (see A/55/874, para. 10
(a)), the General Assembly, by its resolution 55/180 B of 14 June 2001, authorized
the Secretary-General to enter into commitments in the amount of $99.5 million
gross for the maintenance of UNIFIL for the period from 1 July to 31 December
2001, and decided that that amount should be assessed on Member States.

5. The Committee notes that amounts totalling $3,262.0 million have been
assessed on Member States in respect of UNIFIL since its inception to 31 December
2001 and that contributions received as at 30 September 2001 totalled $3,018.9
million. Outstanding balances amount to $243.1 million.

6. Cash balances of UNIFIL amounted to $107.7 million as at 30 September
2001. The Advisory Committee was informed that troop-contributing countries had
received payments totalling $962,411,180 for the period from 1 December 1989 to
31 December 2000, and that an estimated amount of $47,691,892 was still due for
the period from 1 January to 31 August 2001. The Committee was also informed
that reimbursement to troop-contributing Member States was expected to be up to
date by the end of the year, subject to the availability of cash.

7. The cost estimates submitted by the Secretary-General for the period from 1
July 2001 to 30 June 2002 amount to $136,816,100 gross ($132,983,100 net),
inclusive of a $201,200 budgeted voluntary contribution. The latter relates to the
contribution by the Government of Lebanon of the UNIFIL House in Beirut since
February 1998. The Committee sought clarification with regard to the procedures to
be followed in respect of budgeting for additional support account requirements
related to UNIFIL and was informed that it was the intention of the Secretary-
General, on the basis of whatever decision the General Assembly might take
regarding the additional resources under the support account for peacekeeping
operations, to prorate the financing of the additional support account resources
approved among the upcoming revised financial resolutions for the missions, whose
updated budgets will be considered during the fifty-sixth session of the General
Assembly.

8. This estimated requirement of $136,614,900 (net of voluntary contributions of
$201,200) represents a decrease of $62,303,000, or 31.3 per cent in total resources
(gross), compared with the resources of $198,917,900 approved for the period from
1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. As shown in table 1 of the report, the proposed budget
reflects a 26.7 per cent decrease under military personnel costs, a 9.7 per cent
decrease under civilian personnel costs, a 56.7 per cent decrease in operational
requirements, and a 3.9 per cent decrease in staff assessment costs; these reductions
are partially offset by increases in other programmes.

9. As indicated in paragraph 11 of the report, the budget proposal is based on an
average troop strength of 4,057 for the period in accordance with the Secretary-
General’s reconfiguration of the Force, which will be achieved through the non-
replacement or reduction of units on the occasion of their normal rotations. On the
basis of this approach, the troop strength of UNIFIL, which was planned at the level
of 4,543 troops as at 31 August 2001, will gradually reduce to 3,613 by 31 May
2002 and will achieve the target level of 2,000 troops at the beginning of the next
financial period (see A/56/431, annex I.C, para. 2).

10. UNIFIL will be supported by a civilian establishment of 491 staff, including
144 international (28 Professional, 82 Field Service and 34 General Service posts)
and 339 local posts. The proposed civilian composition of UNIFIL reflects a
decrease of 17 international posts and 41 local level posts. The Advisory Committee
was informed that, as at 31 August 2001, there were 4,384 troops in UNIFIL; of the
161 authorized international staff posts, 134 were encumbered, and of the 380
authorized local staff posts, 350 were encumbered.

11. The Advisory Committee points out that no clear information was
provided in the budget document as to the rationale for the proposed
composition of the civilian personnel of UNIFIL. The Committee points out
that the reduction of 17 international staff posts does not seem to be
proportionate with the reduction in military personnel. The Committee
therefore expects that a further reduction in international staff will be
proposed for the financial period starting 1 July 2002.

12. The Advisory Committee notes that four Professional posts will be abolished
in the Mine Action Coordination Cell and the related de-mining functions will be
outsourced to contractors. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the de-
mining programme of the Cell is supported by voluntary contributions and funded
entirely through the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine
Action, which is maintained by the Executive Office of the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations. A total contribution of $1,837,262 to the Trust Fund was
received as at 1 October 2001. A donors’ conference took place in Beirut on 21 May
2001 at which two Governments pledged a contribution of $50 million to support
mine action in Lebanon; however, no payment has been made as of 11 October
2001.

13. The Committee notes from paragraph 11 of the report that, in accordance with
the concept of operation, fewer resources are requested in the proposed budget for
the maintenance and replacement of vehicles and major equipment and that the
engineering effort will focus on renovation and maintenance of existing premises.
Nevertheless, in view of the downsizing of the Force, the Committee cautions
against what appears to be excessive replacement of various types of
equipment; for example, a provision of $140,260 is budgeted for replacement of
1,150 pieces of office furniture and a provision of $117,481 is budgeted for
replacement of 40 per cent of the items of the current inventory of
accommodation equipment.

14. The Committee was informed that increased attention would be paid by the
administration of UNIFIL to consolidating storage of spare parts in technologically
advanced warehouses to be equipped with the Field Assets Control System. The
Committee supports the idea in principle, although it cautions that such
warehouses should be established in the mission area only when fully justified
from the operational point of view and when economically feasible.

15. The Committee also notes from paragraph 11 of the report that a certain
portion of the facilities in the area of operations will require new prefabricated
structures that will be provided through the purchase of contingent-owned
prefabricated units during the budgeted period. In this connection, the Committee
requests that, before a decision is made with respect to such a purchase, a study
should be conducted to ensure that it is justified and efficient.

16. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session in
connection with the financing of UNIFIL are outlined in paragraph 5 of the report.
Taking into account its comments and observations in the paragraphs above,
the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General’s
proposal.
