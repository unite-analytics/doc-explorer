FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER MISSION IN LIBERIA

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)
has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the Financing of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) (A/48/592). During its
consideration of the item, the Committee was provided with additional
information.

2. UNOMIL was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 866 (1993)
of 22 September 1993, for a period of seven months, i.e. from 22 September 1993-
21 April 1994. The Secretary-General’s report (A/48/592), inter alia, submits
the budget estimates for UNOMIL in respect of that period. However, as
discussed below, the implementation of the mandate of UNOMIL will not be
possible within that time-frame.

3. As recalled in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council
of 9 September 1993 (S/26422), the peace agreement signed at Cotonou on
25 July 1993 by the Liberian parties envisaged the peace process as a continuum
from the cease-fire through disarmament and demobilization to the holding of
national elections seven months after the signing of the agreement (S/26422,
para. 10). In this connection, the parties agreed that a transitional
Government would be established at the same time as the commencement of
disarmament (S/26422, para. 6). A precondition to the start of disarmament and
demobilization would be the expansion of the Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) by troops from States
members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) outside the West African
region (S/26868, para. 3).

4. The agreement called for the United Nations and (ECOMOG) to supervise and
monitor the implementation of the agreement. Specifically, the agreement
assigned ECOMOG, which had been in Liberia since 1990, primary responsibility
for supervising the implementation of its provisions and called upon the United
Nations to monitor the various implementation procedures in order to verify
their impartial application (S/26422, para. 10). The mandate of UNOMIL, as

approved by the Security Council, is quoted in paragraph 11 of the Secretary-
General’s report (A/48/592).

5. As stated in the report of the Secretary-General (S/26422, para. 36),
"UNOMIL would be the first peace-keeping operation undertaken by the United
Nations in cooperation with a peace-keeping mission already set up by another
organization, in this case a subregional organization". The Secretary-General’s
report to the Council therefore explained how coordination between UNOMIL and
ECOMOG would be ensured and outlined the respective roles and responsibilities
of UNOMIL and ECOMOG in the implementation of the agreement. In this
connection, the Secretary-General stated that although the "relationship could
potentially present some challenges, [he was] confident that with the good will
of all concerned, especially the Liberian parties, this relationship [would] be
successful and [might] even set a precedent for future peace-keeping missions"
(S/26422, para. 36). The Secretary-General also stated his intention, which was
welcomed by the Council, to conclude an agreement with the Chairman of ECOWAS,
defining, before deployment of UNOMIL, the roles and responsibilities of UNOMIL
and ECOWAS in the implementation of the peace agreement (see S/26868, para. 9,
and para. 15 below).

6. In his report to the Security Council of 13 December 1993, the Secretary-
General noted that, from the beginning of the peace process in Liberia, all
parties had been aware that the timetable, which called for disarmament to begin
within 30 days of signature of the agreement, concomitant with the establishment
of the transitional Government, was "highly ambitious, especially given the
complexities in establishing the joint UNOMIL/ECOMOG peace-keeping mission,
including the deployment of additional ECOMOG troops" (para. 31). While
recommending that UNOMIL should continue to implement the mandate entrusted to
it under Security Council resolution 866 (1993), the Secretary-General stated
that it was unlikely that the original timetable for elections would be met
(para. 34).

7. In his report of 14 February 1994 (S/1994/168), the Secretary-General
informed the Council that the transitional Government had not yet been
installed. However, the battalions from the Governments of the United Republic
of Tanzania and Uganda had arrived in Liberia and ECOMOG had indicated that it
could commence disarmament with two battalions of the expanded ECOMOG. The
Secretary-General also stated that preparation of schedules for the
implementation of disarmament, as called for in the Cotonou agreement, had been
delayed owing to the failure of the parties concerned to provide the information
necessary for the preparation of those schedules. However, information was
currently being made available by the parties and 10 encampment sites had been
identified. Furthermore, the parties had agreed that the disarmament of
approximately 60,000 combatants would commence simultaneously and was likely to
continue over a two-to-three-month period.

8. ln document S/1994/168/Add.1, dated 23 February 1994, the Secretary-General
reported that, at a meeting on 15 February, the Liberian parties had "reached
agreement on most of the outstanding issues which had impeded the commencement
of disarmament and the installation of the transitional Government ... It was
also agreed that free and fair elections would be held on 7 September 1994"
(paras. 2 and 3), instead of the originally foreseen date of

February/March 1994. Although the question of the disposition of the remaining
Cabinet posts of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Finance and Defence was not resolved
at that meeting, the parties agreed that disarmament would commence on 7 March
and that the installation of the transitional Government would take place on the
same day. The Committee was subsequently informed that the transitional
Government had been installed on 7 March.

9. It is evident from the above that the mandate of UNOMIL cannot be
implemented within the original time-frame. The Committee’s comments regarding
the savings likely to be realized during the mandate period are contained in
paragraphs 16-36 below.

Voluntary contributions

10. In document S/26422, the Secretary-General stated that, while the question
of the finances for the ECOMOG operation in Liberia was not the responsibility
of the United Nations, the realities of the situation, i.e. that financial
support was needed, could not be ignored (paras. 23 and 24); furthermore, as
mentioned above, ECOMOG was assigned the primary responsibility for ensuring the
implementation of the peace agreement.

11. The Secretary-General therefore proposed to establish a trust fund. The
Security Council, in its resolution 866 (1993), in addition to deciding to
establish UNOMIL, welcomed the intention to establish the Trust Fund which, in
addition to supporting troops of participating ECOMOG countries and facilitating
the sending of reinforcements by African States to ECOMOG, would also assist in
mine-clearing and humanitarian and development activities, as well as in the
electoral process. Although not specifically mentioned in resolution
866 (1993), the Committee notes that, in paragraph 38 of document S/26422, which
was subsequently welcomed by the Council in its resolution 866 (1993), the
Secretary-General stated that the Trust Fund would also cover, inter alia,
demobilization and elections.

12. As stated in paragraph 33 of document A/48/592, the Trust Fund, called
"Trust Fund for the Implementation of the Cotonou Accord on Liberia" was
established on 23 September 1993. The Committee notes that a voluntary
contribution of $1 million has been received from the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, earmarked specifically for
humanitarian activities. In addition, a pledge from the Government of the
United States of America, in the amount of $19,830,000, was made to support the
transport, equipping and maintenance of the expanded ECOMOG peace-keeping force.
As stated in paragraph 26 of the Secretary-General’s report (S/1994/168), "to
date $8.83 million of this pledge has been remitted to the Trust Fund to cover
the costs incurred in the uplifting and eventual repatriation of the additional
troops". The Committee was informed that a further deposit of approximately
$5 million was expected shortly. The Committee notes that the Government of
Denmark has also contributed $295,000 to the Trust Fund (S/1994/168, para. 26).
The Advisory Committee requests the Secretary-General to include information on
the terms and conditions of the use of the Trust Fund in his subsequent reports
on UNOMIL.

13. The Committee notes that trust funds are established for most peace-keeping
operations. The Committee underlines the importance of clearly and consistently
defining the purpose for which a fund is being established; it is also essential
that all procedures outlined in the relevant financial regulations and rules be
adhered to with regard to both the establishment and the management of the trust
funds.

14. As stated above, in its resolution 866 (1993), the Security Council
welcomed the Secretary-General’s intention to conclude an agreement with the
Chairman of ECOWAS that would define the roles and responsibilities of UNOMIL
and ECOWAS in the implementation of the peace agreement.

15. In document S/26868, the Secretary-General reported to the Council on the
exchange of letters with the Chairman of ECOWAS, which constituted the necessary
agreement. The Advisory Committee notes that the agreement reiterates much of
what is contained in the Secretary-General’s report (S/26422) regarding the
respective roles of and the relationship between UNOMIL and ECOMOG. That
report, in the opinion of the Advisory Committee, left a number of unanswered
questions with regard to the relationship between UNOMIL and ECOMOG in the
discharge of their respective responsibilities. A proper and specific
delineation of responsibilities and a specific detailed plan of operation are
necessities, given the interrelationship between UNOMIL and ECOMOG in achieving
the joint goals of the mission.

Cost estimates for the period 22 September 1993 to 21 April 1994

16. As stated in his report (A/48/592), the Secretary-General’s cost estimates
for UNOMIL for the period from 22 September to 21 April 1994 amounted to
$43,509,200 gross ($42,603,800 net), including costs related to the technical
survey mission and the advance team of military observers. That amount provided
for the deployment of 303 military observers, 20 military medical personnel, 45
military engineers, 58 United Nations Volunteers and 228 civilian staff,
including 139 local personnel.

17. For the reasons given in paragraph 108 of document A/C.5/48/40 of
9 December 1993, including changes in the deployment schedules of military
observers, civilian personnel, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, the
Secretary-General revised the above-mentioned amount to $40,318,000 gross
($39,560,800 net). By its decision 48/478 of 23 December 1993, the General
Assembly, on an exceptional basis, authorized the Secretary-General to enter
into total commitments up to the amount of $40,318,000 ($39,560,800 net) and
decided to apportion this amount among Member States.

18. The Advisory Committee was informed that, because of further changes in the
deployment schedules of military observers, civilian personnel, helicopters and
fixed-wing aircraft, as discussed below, the estimate has been further reduced
by $7,520,900 gross ($7,335,700 net) to $32,797,100 gross ($32,225,100 net);
i.e. savings will result in respect of the assessed amount of $40,318,000
($39,560,800 net) for the period from 22 September 1993 to 21 April 1994. The
table annexed to the present report, provided by representatives of the
Secretary-General, compares, by line item, the estimates contained in documents

A/48/592 and A/C.5/48/40 and the revised figures provided to the Committee
during its consideration of the item.

19. The Advisory Committee’s observations concerning the budgeted amounts are
given below. In the opinion of the Committee, the extent to which the revised
estimate is accurate will depend in large measure on events and the
corresponding ability of UNOMIL and ECOMOG to implement their mandates.

20. Part I of annex II to the Secretary-General’s report (A/48/592) outlines
the cost parameters for the estimates; the Advisory Committee notes that the
travel cost of military and civilian personnel to the mission area has been
estimated at an average cost of $8,000 per person per round trip (basic air fare
$3,500 and 100 kilograms accompanied baggage $4,500).

21. In response to inquiry, the Committee was informed that the above-mentioned
cost was based on the average cost, based on the expected country of origin of
personnel and military observers. Notwithstanding that fact, the Committee is
of the view that the cost of $8,000 may be excessive and that savings may be
realized in this regard. In this connection, on the basis of additional
information received, the Committee queries whether in fact all personnel will
exercise their entitlement to 100 kilograms accompanied baggage, the average
cost of which is more than the average cost of the actual air ticket. The
Committee reiterates its view that, whenever possible, group travel arrangements
be used and requests the Secretariat to keep this under review. It also
recommends that the possibility of providing for unaccompanied baggage be
examined with a view to achieving greater cost-effectiveness.

22. The Committee also notes from the cost parameters that a hazardous duty
station allowance of $600 per person per month is budgeted for international
staff, while an equivalent of 15 per cent of their salaries is budgeted for this
purpose for local staff. The Committee trusts that any payment relating to
hazardous duty station allowance is made in accordance with the relevant rules
and regulations of the United Nations.

23. As shown in annex I to the present report, the estimate for the mission
subsistence allowance (MSA) of military observers has been reduced by $397,100;
this relates to the revised schedule of deployment that is also annexed to the
present report (see annex II). As shown therein, all military observers have
been deployed, but the schedule of actual deployment differs from that contained
in annex II to document A/48/592 under line item 1.

24. The Committee notes that the estimate for civilian personnel costs has been
further reduced by $2,266,400; the estimates for the support account to peace-
keeping operations and for staff assessment have also been reduced. These
reductions relate to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel. The
Committee was informed that, of the 89 international staff, 60 had been deployed
as at 21 January; of the 139 local staff, 107 had been employed. In addition,
only 8 of the budgeted number of 58 United Nations Volunteers have been
deployed.

25. Provision has been made in the estimates for the payment of MSA and the
travel costs in respect of 200 civilian electoral observers. As mentioned

above, however, elections are now foreseen for September 1994; consequently
savings will be realized under this item in respect of the period from
22 September 1993 to 21 April 1994; however such reduction is not included in
the revised estimates provided by representatives of the Secretary-General.

26. Representatives of the Secretary-General informed the Committee that, as
shown in annex I to the present document, the estimate for helicopter operations
has been reduced by $4,050,700; this relates to delays in the deployment of six
helicopters. The Committee was informed that the revised amount provides for 1
helicopter for 4 months, 3 helicopters for 1.5 months and 2 helicopters for 3
months. The estimate for fixed-wing aircraft reflects a reduction of $537,900,
owing to the delay in deploying one fixed-wing aircraft; the revised estimate
provides for the aircraft for three weeks.

27. The Committee reiterates its observation, made in connection with the
financing of the United Nations Protection Force (see A/48/778), that
justification of the requirements for air operations should henceforth be
provided in terms of the operational requirements of a mission.

28. The estimate for other equipment amounts to $2.7 million and includes, as
indicated under line item 9 in annex I to document A/48/592, $804,900 for the
acquisition of data-processing equipment. The Advisory Committee trusts that
care will be exercised in the acquisition of the equipment enumerated therein;
in this connection, it questions the need for certain items such as high-speed
printers.

29. A total of $215,300 has been budgeted for the mine-clearing programme. In
this connection, the Committee notes that, as cited in paragraph 11 (g) of
A/48/592, the mandate of UNOMIL includes the training of ECOMOG engineers in
mine clearance and, in cooperation with ECOMOG, coordination of the
identification of mines and assistance in the clearance of mines and unexploded
bombs. As indicated under line item 14 in annex II to document A/48/592, most
of the provision relates to the recruitment of three mine-clearing instructors
for a period of four months, as well as one paramedic experienced in stabilizing
patients injured in mine accidents.

30. The estimate for UNOMIL includes an amount of $5.2 million for assistance
for disarmament and demobilization as discussed under line item 15 in annex II
to document A/48/592. In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes from
paragraph 11 (e) of document A/48/592 that, as stipulated in Security Council
resolution 866 (1993), the mandate of UNOMIL in this regard was to "develop a
plan and assess financial requirements for the demobilization of combatants".
Moreover, as stated above, the Trust Fund established by the Secretary-General
was intended, inter alia, to cover demobilization.

31. The Advisory Committee also notes the Secretary-General’s statement in his
report (S/26868, para. 18), of which the Security Council took note in document
S/26886, that, although it had originally been foreseen that the costs of
disarmament and demobilization would be met by the Trust Fund for Liberia, no
pledges for that purpose had yet been made to the Fund. Because "disarmament
and demobilization are essential for the establishment of the transitional
Government, the holding of free elections and, therefore, to the successful

implementation of the entire peace process", the Secretary-General informed the
Council that he had included approximately $5 million in the UNOMIL budget to
cover only the immediate short-term needs of disarmament and demobilization.
However, "should contributions for disarmament and demobilization be made to the
Trust Fund, the UNOMIL budget would be reimbursed by such contributions".

32. The Advisory Committee notes that the $5 million would enable approximately
54,000 adult combatants and 6,000 child soldiers to give up their arms and
return to their homes. Other aspects of demobilization, including training and
other reintegration programmes to help the ex-combatants to build sustainable
new lives, would be included in the inter-agency appeal for humanitarian
assistance (S/26868, para. 18). This point was again emphasized in the
Secretary-General’s subsequent report (S/1994/168), wherein he explained that
UNOMIL had developed a plan for the demobilization and reintegration of
ex-combatants into civilian society. As stated in paragraph 34 of that report,
"after handing over their weapons at the encampment sites, ex-combatants will be
clothed, fed and sensitized to the problems of their return to civilian society.
They will be issued identification cards that will entitle them to immediate
reintegration assistance, such as vocational training, medical care and
agricultural assistance". However, that assistance, i.e. reintegration
assistance, "will have to be financed through voluntary contributions". In this
connection, the Advisory Committee notes that donations of $146.7 million have
been received in response to the Secretary-General’s appeals for emergency and
humanitarian assistance in Liberia (A/48/592, para. 25).

33. In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls its previous
observations regarding the need to specify the activities that relate directly
to an operation and that should be financed through assessment and those
activities for the long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction of a country that
would be financed from other sources (A/47/990, para. 10).

34. The Advisory Committee was informed that the estimate for the
disarmament/demobilization programme had been developed as a comprehensive
project and therefore constituted a distinct self-contained entity within the
UNOMIL estimates. Accordingly, it includes estimates for equipment and vehicles
separate from those that appear under the line items for equipment and
transport. The Advisory Committee queried this treatment which, prima facie,
appears somewhat unusual. However, bearing in mind that reimbursements to the
peace-keeping budget may be forthcoming if contributions to the Trust Fund for
these purposes are made, the Committee recognizes the value of identifying the
total cost of the subprogramme. At the same time, because the subprogramme
forms an integral part of the mandate of UNOMIL, the Advisory Committee
emphasizes that the equipment for the subprogramme forms part of the operation’s
total inventory and should be managed as such.

35. As noted above, the disarmament of the 60,000 combatants (54,000 adult
combatants and 6,000 child soldiers) is likely to continue over a
two-to-three-month period; as also noted above, the implementation of the
programme depends on the preparation of the schedules for disarmament. Even
assuming that disarmament has begun on 7 March, it is unlikely, in view of the
projected timetable, that the entire disarmament/demobilization programme will

be completed by 21 April, i.e. some savings in respect of the current mandate
will arise that should be reflected in the performance report.

36. A number of international experts are to be engaged in respect of
rehabilitation/reintegration assistance as indicated in item 15 (a) (i) in
annex II to document A/48/592. In this connection, representatives of the
Secretary-General emphasized that most of the physicians, health workers,
counsellors, care-givers etc. are local personnel as outlined in item 15 (iii).
However, it was considered necessary to engage international experts who are
specialized in such assistance. The Committee trusts that efforts will be made
to secure such expertise at a reasonable cost.

37. As stated above, UNOMIL will not be able to complete its mandate within the
time-frame originally envisaged, i.e. between 22 September 1993 and
21 April 1994. The Committee was informed that the Secretary-General intends to
request an extension of the mandate. In the circumstances, there is no need, at
this stage, to consider the estimates provided by the Secretary-General in
respect of the liquidation phase of the mission, originally foreseen to take
place between 22 April and 30 June 1994.

38. The General Assembly has authorized the Secretary-General to enter into
commitments up to $40,318,000 gross ($39,560,800 net) for the period from
22 September 1993 to 21 April 1994; it has also apportioned that amount among
Member States. The Secretary-General, as discussed above, has reduced the
estimate to $32,797,100 gross ($32,225,100 net) for UNOMIL; savings totalling
$7,520,900 gross ($7,335,700 net) will thus be reflected in the performance
report. The Advisory Committee, bearing in mind its observations above, in
particular those related to the disarmament and demobilization programme,
expects that further savings will also be realized in respect of this period.

39. At this stage, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly
appropriate $32,797,100 gross ($32,225,100 net) in respect of the period from
22 September 1993 to 21 April 1994. The Committee points out that this is
$7,520,900 gross ($7,335,700 net) less than the amount of $40,318,000 gross
($39,560,800 net) that has already been assessed in respect of the same period,
pursuant to General Assembly decision 48/478. The Committee recommends that the
difference be utilized to offset future assessments on Member States such as the
assessment in respect of the commitment authority being recommended below.

40. With respect to the period beyond 21 April 1994, the Committee recommends
that, should the Security Council decide to extend UNOMIL beyond 21 April 1994,
the Secretary-General be authorized to enter into commitments at a monthly rate
not to exceed $4,359,100 gross ($4,232,900 net), subject to the prior
concurrence of the Advisory Committee as to the actual amount, for a period of
three months, to enable him to prepare the budget corresponding to the new
mandate period and the performance report for the current period. This figure
represents a revised estimate that was submitted to the Advisory Committee by
representatives of the Secretary-General. It differs from a pro rata amount
that would have been derived from the appropriation recommended in paragraph 39
above in that non-recurrent costs for the previous period have been deleted;
this reduction has been partially offset by an increase to cover the expected
full deployment of military personnel and international and local staff.
