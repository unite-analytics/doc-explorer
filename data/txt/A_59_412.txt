Financing of the United Nations Operation in Burundi

Proposed budget of the United Nations Operation in
Burundi for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2004/05 $333,174,000a

Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2004/05 $329,714,400

a Includes commitment authority of $106,334,600 for the period from 1 July to
31 October 2004 (see para. 3 below).

I. Introduction

1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 11, 14,
21, 28 and 29 below would entail a reduction of $3,459,600 to the proposed
budget for the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) for the period
from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 (A/59/300). The Committee also makes a
number of observations and recommendations with regard to the
administration and management of the Mission and opportunities for further
savings (see paras. 22, 23, and 26 below).

2. The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the
financing of ONUB are listed at the end of the present report.

II. Information on financial aspects relating to the
period 2004/05

3. The General Assembly, by its resolution 58/312 of 18 June 2004, granted
ONUB commitment authority of $106,334,600 for the maintenance of the Operation

A/59/412

during the period from 1 July to 31 October 2004. The full amount of the
commitment authority of $106,334,600 has been assessed on Member States.

4. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 28 September 2004, the
incumbency for ONUB was as follows:

Authorized
(interim budget) Encumbered

Vacancy rate
(percentage)

Military observers 200 183 8.5

Military contingents 5 450 4 318 20.8

Civilian police 120 45 62.5

International staff 442 231 47.7

National staff 426 151 64.5

United Nations Volunteers 191 73 61.8

III. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to
30 June 2005

A. Mandate and planned results

5. The mandate of ONUB was established by the Security Council in its
resolution 1545 (2004) of 21 May 2004. To implement the Security Council’s
mandate, ONUB will undertake a number of activities grouped into the components
of the Operation’s results-based budgeting framework for the period 2004/05,
namely: political process, security sector reform, security environment, human
rights and humanitarian assistance, as well as a support component.

6. The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts of the Operation to present
the proposed budget in the results-based budgeting format. The Committee is
of the view, however, that there is room for further improvement, particularly
as regards the measurability of indicators of achievement and outputs. The
presentation of external factors also needs further refinement, since most of
them concern only the availability of voluntary contributions by donors.
Moreover, the Committee is of the view that the output “Quick-impact
projects” of component 1, “Political process”, should be more appropriately
included under component 4, “Human rights and humanitarian assistance”,
given that these projects fall under the category of humanitarian assistance (see
also para. 32 below). The Committee also points out that quick-impact projects are
coordinated by staff of the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for humanitarian and development coordination (see A/59/300,
para. 19).

7. The proposed structure of ONUB is discussed in detail in paragraphs 16 to 21
below. As presented, the proposed structure provides for the Operation to be headed
by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the USG level, assisted by
a Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Governance
and Stabilization and a Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, both at the ASG level, and the



3
A/59/412

military operations to be headed by a Force Commander at the D-2 level. The
Operation will be supervised and controlled from a single integrated headquarters in
Bujumbura and will have five regional offices.

B. Resource requirements

8. The Secretary-General’s proposed budget for ONUB for the period from 1 July
2004 to 30 June 2005 amounts to $333,174,000 (gross). The proposed budget
incorporates and supersedes the budgetary proposals for the period from 1 July to
31 December 2004 set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 21 May 2004
(A/58/802).

9. The proposed budget provides for the deployment of 200 military observers,
5,450 contingent personnel, 120 civilian police, 403 international staff, 423 national
staff and 172 United Nations Volunteers.

1. Military and police personnel

10. The estimated requirements of $143,391,700 under military and police
personnel reflect a delayed deployment factor of 5 per cent in respect of military
observers and civilian police and 3 per cent in respect of military contingents. The
Advisory Committee was informed that the deployment of military and police
personnel had been gradually improving and that the Operation would achieve 98
per cent deployment of its military and police personnel by 31 December 2004.

11. The estimated requirements of $143,391,700 under military and police
personnel include a provision of $14,075,100 for rations, based on the daily rate of
$6.40 per person for basic rations. The Committee notes in this connection, that the
rates for rations and bottled water used for the United Nations Mission in Liberia
(UNMIL) and the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (MONUC) are $4.74 and $5.98, respectively, for the period 2004/05.
The Advisory Committee requested clarification with regard to the rates used
in estimating the cost of rations and was informed that, based on the current
contracts for the provision of dry, fresh and frozen rations, inclusive of
warehouse management, distribution, bottled water, provision of containers
and provision of reserve ration packs, requirements for the military contingents
are now estimated at $13,980,700, a reduction of $94,400.

12. The Advisory Committee was informed that some troops had been arriving in
the area of operation without sufficient equipment and required additional efforts on
the part of the administration, as well as cooperation from fully equipped
contingents to bridge the gap. The Mission also faced difficulty in recruiting a
sufficient number of civilian police at the early stage of the operation. While the
situation has improved, according to the clarification received by the
Committee, it is of the view that these earlier problems should be analysed,
conclusions drawn and lessons learned to be applied to other similar situations.

13. The Advisory Committee was apprised of the high degree of cooperation that
exists among various participants in the area of operation, as well as with other
peacekeeping operations in the region. This includes coordination of mine action
activities in the mission area undertaken by the Mine Action Coordination Centre,
which is funded in part from the Mission’s budget (a provision of $1,364,000 for



4
A/59/412

that purpose was requested for 2004/05) and administered by UNOPS under the
overall direction and guidance of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
MONUC provides assistance to ONUB in air operations and by making available to
ONUB its level III and IV medical facilities and providing some specialized
expertise in communications and logistics. The Committee welcomes this
cooperation. The next performance report should include details of this
cooperation, including the financial impact.

2. Civilian personnel

14. The estimated requirements of $53,929,100 under civilian personnel provide
for salary and common staff costs of 403 international staff, 423 national staff and
172 United Nations Volunteers. The estimates reflect a vacancy rate of 20 per cent
in respect of international staff, 10 per cent in respect of national staff and 5 per cent
in respect of United Nations Volunteers. The Committee questions whether the
assumption of deployment used in the budget estimates is realistic, given the
latest deployment data shown in paragraph 4 above. In view of the obvious
delays in deployment, the Committee recommends that the delayed deployment
factor be adjusted to a more realistic rate of 25 per cent for international staff,
15 per cent for national staff and 10 per cent for United Nations Volunteers.

15. The Advisory Committee is particularly concerned about the slow pace of
recruitment of national staff, where the vacancy rate as of 28 September 2004
was 64.5 per cent. The Committee expects that urgent measures will be taken to
reduce the vacancy rate of national staff. The Committee also encourages
greater use of national staff, where possible, as has been requested by the
Committee (see A/58/809, para. 8) and the General Assembly in the past (see
resolution 58/312).

Structure of the Operation

16. The Advisory Committee had an exchange of views with representatives of the
Secretary-General on what appears to be the application of a model structure with
certain commonalities for current and future missions. The Committee discusses this
matter in paragraphs 17 to 26 of its report on the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) (A/59/390).

17. The Committee’s comments and observations on the proposed structure of
MINUSTAH also apply to a large extent to the proposed structure of ONUB. These
comments and observations, when applicable, are included for easy reference in the
present report on ONUB.

18. The Committee appreciates the work that has been done so far, but it is of
the opinion that the concerns indicated in its report on MINUSTAH have not
been fully addressed, particularly with regard to the need to avoid
fragmentation, to establish clear lines of authority and to avoid the potential
for grade inflation. In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls that the post
of Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident Coordinator
and Humanitarian Coordinator, was originally proposed at the D-2 level for ONUB
(see A/58/802, para. 5).

19. The Committee notes that while the organizational chart of ONUB lists
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities under the Principal Deputy



5
A/59/412

Special Representative of the Secretary-General for governance and stabilization,
the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities performed by
MINUSTAH are the responsibility of the Deputy Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for humanitarian and development coordination.

20. The Committee notes that there is direct reporting to the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General by certain units, such as those of legal
affairs, public information and communications and political affairs in this Mission,
as well as in UNMIL, MONUC and United Nations Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK). The Committee was assured that this responds to lessons
learned and reflects direct support to some of the functions of the Special
Representatives of these multidimensional missions. The Committee cautions,
however, against a tendency to replicate functions of the Operation itself in the
Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General or the Deputy
Special Representatives of the Secretary-General. The aim should be to
increase efficiency and accountability and to improve management; it should
not result in an increase in the number of posts or the grade level of the posts
identified either in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General or in other units.

Recommendations on posts

21. In view of the paragraphs above, and taking into account what has been
stated by the Committee in paragraphs 17 to 26 of its report on MINUSTAH
(A/59/390), the Advisory Committee makes the following recommendations for
adjustments regarding the staffing establishment in ONUB:

In the Office of the Special Representative: (i) the post of the Director
proposed at the D-1 level, should be at the P-5 level; (ii) the Committee
does not see the need for a Political Affairs Officer (P-4) in view of the
proximity of the Political Affairs Office to the Office of the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General; (iii) the Committee does not see
the need for a Protocol Officer (P-3), whose functions should be absorbed
by other staff of the Office;

In the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative (Governance
and Stabilization): for the reasons given in paragraph 18 above, one P-4
(Political Affairs Officer) and one international General Service
(Administrative Assistant) post should be abolished to avoid duplication of
functions;

In the Office of the Deputy Special Representative (Humanitarian and
Development Coordination): (i) the level of the Deputy Special
Representative of the Secretary-General should be set at the D-2 level;
(ii) one P-4 post should be eliminated to avoid duplication of coordination
and liaison functions;

Both the Office of the Legal Adviser and the Communications and Public
Information Office should be headed at the P-5 instead of the D-1 level, in
view of the available support from headquarters. Consequently, the D-1
posts should be downgraded to the P-5 level. The head of the
Communications and Public Information Office could also perform the
functions of spokesperson.



6
A/59/412

These recommendations are made on the understanding that the staffing of
ONUB would be revisited in the next budget for ONUB, in the light of further
experience. The impact of the recommendations on the budget would be a
reduction of $489,700.

3. Operational costs

Official travel

22. The estimate for official travel for 2004/05, as shown in section II.A. of the
proposed budget, amounts to $1,685,400. This amount comprises a provision of
$362,600 for training-related travel and $1,322,800 for other official travel. Having
reviewed additional information provided to it, the Committee finds that the
Operation is proposing an excessive number of visits, by both mission and
headquarters staff, as well as an excessive number of travel days. For example, the
Operation is planning two visits of 10 days each to attend budget review meetings at
Headquarters in New York, while such meetings are usually conducted for two or
three days each. Furthermore, the Operation is proposing $60,000 to conduct 60
within-mission area trips of five days each, i.e. a total of 300 days will be spent on
such trips. The Committee, while not recommending specific reductions in
travel estimates, expects that the performance report for the period 2004/05
will reflect savings achieved under travel of staff.

Facilities and infrastructure

23. A provision of $2,869,400 is requested for rental of offices for the advance and
permanent mission headquarters, field sites for troop deployments, logistics base
warehouse complex, transit camp, airport, etc. The Committee was informed during
its hearings that the status of forces agreement had not yet been yet finalized. The
Committee expects that the Operation will sign the agreement on conditions
favourable to ONUB, which should, inter alia, contribute to reductions in rental
costs. The next budget submission should contain information to this effect.

24. The Committee notes from the information provided to it that the Mission
proposes to rent 67 photocopiers and 100 combo copier/fax machines at an
estimated cost of $657,200. Taking into account its observation on the need to avoid
the fragmentation of units (see para. 18 above), as well as the fact that the mission
controls its operations from four buildings in Bujumbura and its five regional
offices, the Advisory Committee is of the view that the rental of equipment should
be reduced. The Committee, while not recommending specific reductions in
rental of equipment, expects that the performance report for the period 2004/05
will reflect savings achieved due to the Committee’s observation.

Ground transportation

25. The requirements of $16,623,500 under ground transportation would provide
for the operation and maintenance of a fleet of 570 United Nations-owned vehicles,
636 contingent-owned vehicles, 45 contingent-armoured personnel carriers and 265
contingent trailers. The total requirements of $16,623,500 include an amount of
$7,543,300 for the replacement cost of 102 4x4 general purpose vehicles, 36 light
and medium-sized buses, 7 vans, 4 engineering and material-handling vehicles, 30
trucks and 38 vehicle attachments for trailers, to be transferred from the strategic



7
A/59/412

deployment stocks at the United Nations Logistics Base. It also includes a provision
for spare parts ($537,700). The Committee notes from the information provided to it
that requirements for spare parts are estimated in respect of ONUB at the rate of $50
to $200 per vehicle less than one year old (depending on the size) and at the rate of
$175 to $750 per vehicle more than one year old. The Committee recalls that in
MINUSTAH, the requirements for spare parts for vehicles are estimated at a
standard rate of 5 per cent. In view of the different approach in estimating
requirements for spare parts for vehicles for peacekeeping operations, the
Committee requests that the Secretary-General review the methodologies used
and apply the one that would more precisely reflect the necessary requirements.

26. An estimated provision of $350,000 is requested for rental of vehicles pending
delivery of United Nations-owned vehicles and equipment. The Committee notes
from the information provided to it that this provision reflects high rental rates, for
example, an hourly rate of $150 for heavy buses and $375 for cranes and a weekly
rate of $1,000 for medium/heavy trucks. The Advisory Committee requests that
the delivery of the United Nations-owned vehicles and equipment be expedited
and that, in the meantime, the Operation review its arrangements for rental of
vehicles with a view to reducing rental costs. The outcome of the review should
be reflected in the next budget submission.

Communications and information technology

27. The Advisory Committee cautions that, when planning its acquisition of
computers, vehicles and other equipment, the Operation should take into
account the established standard ratios, as well as the incumbency situation
and the actual pace of mission deployment. Moreover, the Committee
recommends that requests for resources for communications, information
technology, and facilities and infrastructure include a time frame for the
completion of projects, and that the status of implementation of tasks
performed be reflected in the performance reports (see also A/57/772, para.
102).

Other supplies, services and equipment

28. The estimated requirements under this heading include a provision of $36,000
to cover the cost of official functions held by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General at a monthly cost of $3,000. The Committee was informed, upon
enquiry, that funds for official functions are included in all peacekeeping operations,
for example, MONUC spent $25,200, UNMIL $24,200 and the United Nations
Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) $24,800 from their budgets for such
functions. The Committee notes that while some missions budget for official
functions on the basis of a one-time provision, other missions, including ONUB,
propose monthly hospitality requirements. The Advisory Committee is not
convinced that the latter approach is justified, given that expenditures for
hospitality are not borne evenly throughout the budget year; this requirement
should not be perceived as a hospitality allowance. The Committee requests
that the Secretariat look into this matter and come up with a uniform
presentation of hospitality requirements, which should be based on a consistent
and transparent policy. In the meantime, the Advisory Committee finds the
estimates for official functions for ONUB too high and recommends a reduction
of $12,000.



8
A/59/412

29. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the provision of
$132,200 for ration pack reserves and bottled water reserves budgeted under
other supplies, services and equipment would be reduced to $119,300, a
reduction of $12,900, to reflect a revised cost of bottled water ($1.49 per bottle
instead of $2.55 used in the budget estimates).

Electoral assistance

30. The Security Council, in its resolution 1545 (2004), authorized ONUB “to
contribute to the successful completion of the electoral process stipulated in the
Arusha Agreement, by ensuring a secure environment for free, transparent and
peaceful elections to take place” and decided that ONUB should provide advice and
assistance to the transitional Government and authorities to contribute to their
efforts “to proceed with electoral activities”. The Advisory Committee notes that the
Electoral Assistance Office is responsible for such tasks, thus contributing to
expected accomplishment 1.2 and supporting the related outputs in component 1 of
the results-based framework of ONUB. The proposed staffing resources of the
Office include 125 staff (16 international, 74 national and 35 United Nations
Volunteers). In addition, the mission proposes to hire six international consultants
for a total of six work-months at an estimated cost of $125,300 ($54,000 for
consultancy fees, $37,800 for travel and $33,500 for subsistence allowance). The
consultants will provide expertise mainly in the form of detailed designs, procedures
and draft legislation to be implemented or made operational by the staff of the
mission’s electoral component.

31. The Committee was informed that although the Secretary-General’s report to
the Security Council (S/2004/682) indicated 31 October 2004 as the date for
elections, the electoral process would start as soon as the electoral law had been
enacted by the National Assembly and the required funding had been fully provided.
The Committee was also informed that as at the time of its consideration of the
budget submission for ONUB, a contribution by UNDP of $1 million had been
received towards the elections budget of $21 million to be funded through voluntary
contributions.

Quick-impact projects

32. The estimated requirements of $1 million are included for quick-impact
projects broadly described in paragraph 101 of the budget submission. The
Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the Operation had not started any such
projects and was in the process of identifying areas in which quick-impact projects
would be implemented during the budget period. In this connection, the
Committee stresses the importance of starting quick-impact projects at the
early stages of mission deployment and trusts that the administration will take
urgent steps to expedite the planning and implementation of these projects.

IV. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

33. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of ONUB for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 is indicated in
paragraph 102 of the proposed budget (A/59/300). In view of its comments above,



9
A/59/412

the Advisory Committee recommends that the estimated budget requirements
be reduced from $333,174,000 to $329,714,400.
