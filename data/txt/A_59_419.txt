Financing of the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire

Proposed budget for the United Nations Operation in Côte
d’Ivoire for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2004/05 $384,350,400a

Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2004/05 $378,472,800

a Includes $200,646,600 already appropriated for the period under the terms of General
Assembly resolution 58/310 of 18 June 2004.

I. Introduction

1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 18, 29,
31, 34 and 37 below would entail a reduction of $5,877,600 to the proposed
budget for the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) for the
period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 (A/59/289). The Committee also makes
a number of observations and recommendations with regard to the
administration and management of the mission and the opportunities for
further savings.

2. In May 2004, the Secretary-General submitted a proposed budget for UNOCI
for the 15-month period from 4 April 2004 to 30 June 2005 (A/58/788). On the
recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the General Assembly, by its
resolution 58/310 of 18 June 2004, decided to appropriate to the Special Account for
UNOCI the amount of $96,368,100 for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004 for
the establishment of the Operation, inclusive of the amount of $49,943,300
previously authorized by the Advisory Committee under the terms of section IV of
General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994.

A/59/419

3. By the same resolution, the Assembly decided also to appropriate to the
Special Account for the Operation the amount of $211,101,400, inclusive of
$200,646,600 for the maintenance of the Operation for the period from 1 July to
31 December 2004, $8,547,300 for the support account for peacekeeping operations
and $1,907,500 for the United Nations Logistics Base, on the understanding that a
revised budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 would be submitted
in September 2004, as recommended by the Advisory Committee (see A/58/806,
para. 45). The proposed budget contained in document A/59/289 constitutes that
revised budget.

4. The documentation used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the
financing of UNOCI is listed at the end of the present report.

II. Expenditure and incumbency data for the period from
1 July to 31 December 2004

5. The Advisory Committee was provided with expenditure data for the period
from 1 July to 31 December 2004, as at 24 September 2004 (see annex I).
Expenditure for the period amounted to $84,648,000 against an apportionment of
$200,646,600. The Committee was also informed that the incumbency for UNOCI,
as at 25 September 2004, was as follows:

III. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to
30 June 2005

A. Mandate and planned results

6. The Advisory Committee once again commends the Secretariat for the
well-defined results-based framework it has established for this Operation, and
in particular the close alignment of the components and expected
accomplishments with the mandate of the mission, as set forth in Security
Council resolution 1528 (2004) of 27 February 2004. The Committee points out,
however, that although it appears that the mission is assigning importance to
the humanitarian coordination “pillar” with the establishment of the post of
Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Coordination, Recovery and Reconstruction, the outputs listed under
component 3 do not reflect this. In fact, the concept of the integrated mission
and the coordination role do not seem fully developed in the budget document,
despite the fact that this Operation has had, in effect, six months of experience
in implementing this structure.1

1. Disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement

7. The proposed structure of the mission includes a Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration Section, which is to assist the National
Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration in implementing
the programme.

8. The Advisory Committee notes that, under the Accra III agreement, the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process is to begin on 15 October
2004 (see S/2004/697, para. 35). The Committee was informed that 11 disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration sites were planned and that 6 were at present ready
for use: 3 in the north and 3 in the south. The Advisory Committee requested, but
did not receive, detailed information concerning the funding for the programme,
similar to that provided to the Committee for its consideration of the financing of
UNOCI in May 2004 (see A/58/806, annex III). That information should be
provided to the Fifth Committee in time for its consideration of the proposed
budget for UNOCI. Further, the Advisory Committee requests that, in future,
such information be provided for all missions with a disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration component.

9. The Advisory Committee understands that there remain funding difficulties for
the reintegration phase, a large part of the cost of which was to be covered by a loan
from the World Bank, in the amount of $65 million. As required under its conditions
for the payment of loans, the Bank has suspended disbursements to Côte d’Ivoire
owing to non-payment of debt obligations. The Bank is currently exploring ways to
support the peace process (see S/2004/697, para. 36).

__________________
1 The Committee understands that the Deputy Special Representative for Humanitarian

Coordination, Recovery and Reconstruction was, in fact, appointed in August 2004; however,
the mission has been operating with this structure since April 2004.

A/59/419

2. Regional cooperation

10. In its resolution 1528 (2004), the Security Council requested the Secretary-
General to encourage the United Nations missions in West Africa to share logistical
and administrative support in order to maximize effectiveness and minimize the cost
of the missions, and requested UNOCI to carry out its mandate in close liaison with
the United Nations missions in Sierra Leone and Liberia, including especially in the
prevention of movements of arms and combatants across shared borders and the
implementation of disarmament and demobilization programmes.

11. The Advisory Committee was briefed on inter-mission cooperation in the
region, which is ongoing in three areas: information-sharing, including by means of
meetings and the exchange and secondment or reassignment of personnel in the
military, substantive or support areas; exchange of lessons learned in such areas as
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; and joint operations, such as
coordinated border patrols. The Committee was informed that a report on inter-
mission cooperation and cross-border activities was currently under preparation and
would be issued in the coming weeks.

12. The Advisory Committee was informed that there had also been cooperation
among the missions in the sharing of logistical resources, such as vehicles,
information technology equipment and air assets. Upon request, the Committee was
provided with detailed information on that logistical cooperation (see annex II).

3. Human rights

13. The Operation includes a Human Rights Office which is responsible for
advising and providing technical assistance to the Government of National
Reconciliation in the implementation of the human rights and justice provisions of
the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-
General to the Security Council (S/2004/697), in June 2004 the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights established the International
Commission of Inquiry envisaged under the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement to
investigate all serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law perpetrated
in Côte d’Ivoire since 19 September 2002. In collaboration with the United Nations
Development Programme and other United Nations agencies, UNOCI has been
providing administrative and logistical support, including vehicles, air
transportation and communications, to the Commission on a reimbursable basis.
This will be reflected in the performance report for the period.

4. Preparations for the elections

14. The structure of the Operation includes an Electoral Assistance Office which is
responsible for monitoring and reporting on all phases of the electoral process and
providing technical advice to the national bodies responsible for activities relating
to the electoral process. The Advisory Committee was informed that, despite the
limited progress made in the preparations for the elections owing to problems
encountered in the identification process, as well as the legal issues that will need to
be resolved relating to the nationality of the President, the target month for the
elections remains October 2005.

B. Resource requirements

1. Military and police personnel

Category Authorized

Military observersa 200

Military contingentsa 6 040

Civilian policea 350

a Represents highest level of authorized strength.

15. The estimate of $8,909,400 for military observers for the period from 1 July
2004 to 30 June 2005 is based on the phased deployment of 64 military observers,
with the total authorized strength of 200 observers to be achieved by September
2004. A 10 per cent delayed deployment factor has been applied to requirements for
mission subsistence allowance (MSA).

16. For military contingent personnel, the estimated requirement of $140,397,500
for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 takes into account the phased
deployment of 1,036 personnel, with full deployment of 6,040 troops, including 120
staff officers, to be attained in October 2004. A 5 per cent delayed deployment
factor has been utilized, where applicable. The Advisory Committee notes that
provision is made for the payment of the food and incidental portion of MSA to the
120 staff officers at force headquarters at the rate of $54 per person per day for the
period from 1 July through 31 October 2004, pending finalization of catering
arrangements.

17. The Advisory Committee commends the Operation for the substantial
progress it has made in the emplacement of military contingent personnel and
military observers. As shown in paragraph 5 above, vacancy rates for contingent
personnel have dropped from 73 per cent in May 2004 to the current rate of 3 per
cent; the corresponding figures for military observers are 38 per cent in May 2004
and 17 per cent at present.

18. The Advisory Committee was informed, however, that the aviation transport
unit shown on the organization chart for the military component of the mission (see
A/59/289, annex, sect. C) and the eight military helicopters associated with it had
not been deployed and, further, that a troop-contributing country had as yet to be
identified. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the unit, which is to
consist of up to 180 personnel, had only been budgeted for beginning 1 October
2004. Realistically, however, it is unlikely that the unit will be in place before the
end of December 2004. The Committee therefore recommends that the estimate
for military contingents be reduced by $849,200, corresponding to the amount
budgeted for 180 contingent personnel for the three-month period from
1 October to 31 December 2004 (see also para. 37 below).

19. On the issue of hardwall accommodations for the troops, the Advisory
Committee was informed that every effort was being made to expedite construction
and to have troops in hardwall accommodations within six months of their being
deployed.



6
A/59/419

20. The estimated requirements for civilian police for the period from 1 July 2004
to 30 June 2005 amount to $12,801,100 and are based on a phased deployment, with
the authorized strength of 350 personnel to be attained by November 2004. A 10 per
cent delayed deployment factor has been applied in respect of MSA.

21. The Advisory Committee notes that, of the 350 civilian police authorized, only
210 (see para. 5 above) are currently in place. Upon enquiry as to the reason behind
the high vacancy rate, the Committee was informed that the mission was
experiencing difficulty in finding French-speaking candidates for civilian police,
which the mission considers essential. The Committee understands that this has
been a problem in several peacekeeping operations. While the Committee does not
recommend adjustment of the delayed deployment factor for civilian police at
this time, it does stress the need for the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations to take steps to deal with this matter expeditiously.

2. Civilian personnel

Category Initial proposala Current proposal

International staff 401 387

United Nations volunteers 232 215

a Proposed in the initial budget submitted for the period from 4 April 2004 to 30 June 2005
(A/58/788). Takes into account reductions recommended by the Advisory Committee
(A/58/806, paras. 30 and 32).

b Includes national professional officers and national General Service staff.

22. Estimated requirements for civilian personnel for the period from 1 July 2004
to 30 June 2005, which amount to $51,173,600 ($38,028,200 for international staff,
$7,679,000 for national staff and $5,466,400 for United Nations Volunteers), are
based on phased deployment, with full deployment to be attained in March 2005.
Delayed recruitment factors have been applied to the estimates as follows: 20 per
cent for international staff, 15 per cent for national staff and 20 per cent for United
Nations Volunteers.

Structure of the mission

23. The Advisory Committee is pleased to note that a number of its
recommendations concerning streamlining the structure of the mission (see
A/58/806) were taken into account in the preparation of the revised budget (see
A/59/289, sect. V). Overall staffing has been reduced by 83 from the initial proposal
of 1,090 staff, for a total proposed staffing of 1,007. In addition, a number of higher-
level posts have been downgraded and the Joint Mission Analysis Cell has been
eliminated from the organizational structure of the mission. The Committee notes as
well that, in response to its concerns, the Division of Administration will now report
to the Principal Deputy Special Representative rather than directly to the Special
Representative.

24. The Advisory Committee notes the response to its recommendation that, given
the availability of qualified local candidates in Côte d’Ivoire, the staffing of the
mission could be adjusted to include more national staff. The Committee



7
A/59/419

understands the mission’s concerns as set out in the proposed budget (see A/59/289,
sect. V, recommendation 5), which include the need to hire staff who are trained and
familiar with United Nations practices and procedures during the start-up phase, as
well as concerns about staff safety and neutrality in the light of the current political
situation. The Committee urges the mission to continue its efforts to identify
suitable national candidates.

25. During its consideration of the initial budget for UNOCI for the period from
4 April 2004 to 30 June 2005, the Advisory Committee held an extensive discussion
with the representatives of the Secretary-General concerning the proposed
application of a two-pillar structure for the mission, which would entail the
establishment of two Deputy Special Representative posts within the mission, one
responsible for operations and rule of law and the other for humanitarian
coordination, recovery and reconstruction. The Committee was informed at that time
that it was intended to use this model for all future complex peacekeeping
operations. The Committee recommended that, pending a comprehensive review of
the organizational structure of the mission, the post of Deputy Special
Representative for Humanitarian Coordination, Recovery and Reconstruction be
approved at the D-2 level, rather than at the Assistant Secretary-General level as
was proposed. In the budget document currently under consideration (A/59/289), the
post is again proposed at the Assistant Secretary-General level.

26. In the context of its consideration of the proposed budgets currently before it
on the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) (A/59/390), the
United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) (A/59/300) and UNOCI (A/59/289),
the Advisory Committee held an exchange of views with representatives of the
Secretary-General concerning what appears to be the application of a model
structure with certain commonalities for current and future missions. The
Committee discusses this matter in detail in its report on the proposed budget for
MINUSTAH (A/59/390, paras.17-26). The Committee’s comments and observations
on the proposed structure of MINUSTAH apply to a large extent to the proposed
structure of UNOCI.

27. The Advisory Committee expresses its appreciation of the work that has
been done so far to streamline the structure of the mission; however, some of
the Committee’s concerns, as indicated both in its report on UNOCI (A/58/806)
and in its report on MINUSTAH (A/58/390), have not been fully addressed, in
particular with regard to the need to establish clear lines of authority and avoid
fragmentation and grade inflation.

28. The Advisory Committee notes that, like MINUSTAH, ONUB, the United
Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), the United Nations Organization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), there is direct reporting of certain
units in UNOCI, such as those dealing with legal affairs, communications and public
information and political affairs, to the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General. The Committee was assured that this responded to lessons learned and
reflected the direct support to some of the functions of the Special Representatives
in these multidimensional missions. The Committee cautions, however, against a
tendency to replicate functions of the mission itself in the Office of the Special
Representative of the Deputy Special Representative. The aim should be to
increase efficiency and accountability and to improve management; it should



8
A/59/419

not result in an increase in the number of posts or the grade level of the posts
proposed, either in the Office of the Special Representative or in other units.

Recommendations on posts

29. In view of the comments made in the paragraphs above, the Advisory
Committee makes the following recommendations for adjustments regarding
the staffing establishment in UNOCI:

(a) In the Office of the Special Representative, the post of Director,
proposed at the D-1 level, should be at the P-5 level and the Director should
serve both as Special Assistant to the Special Representative and as Chief of
Staff. The Director should be assisted by a P-3 level Special Assistant who will
also serve as Protocol Officer. The Special Assistant post (P-5) and the two
Protocol Officer posts (1 P-2 and 1 national officer) requested in paragraph 14
of the proposed budget (A/59/289) should be eliminated;

(b) The level of the Deputy Special Representative for Humanitarian
Coordination, Recovery and Reconstruction should be set at the D-2 level (see
para. 25 above);

(c) Both the Office of the Legal Adviser and the Communications and
Public Information Office should be headed at the P-5 level, rather than D-1, in
view of the available support from Headquarters. In the case of the
Communications and Public Information Office, the D-1 post should be
eliminated and the P-5 requested in paragraph 33 of the proposed budget
should act as both head of the Office and Spokesperson.

30. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the post of Special
Adviser on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) at the
D-1 level in view of the important role the Special Adviser is to play in ensuring
close collaboration with ECOWAS in the monitoring of the Accra III agreement
and in supporting the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.

31. The Advisory Committee makes the recommendations in paragraphs 29
and 30 above on the understanding that the staffing of UNOCI will be revisited
in the next budget for the Operation in the light of further experience. The
impact on the budget would be a reduction of $456,100.

3. Operational costs

Training

32. The Advisory Committee was informed that training costs, as shown in the
revised budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, were estimated at a
total amount of $829,066, including $94,600 for training consultants, $620,544 for
training-related travel and $113,922 for training fees, supplies and services. The
Committee notes that this amount represents a significant increase over the initially
estimated total amount of $570,068 for the period, which included $220,600 for
training consultants, $332,433 for training-related travel and $17,035 for training
fees, supplies and services. The Committee considers the revised estimates to be
high. From the supplementary information provided to it, the Committee notes that
some training is to be undertaken in faraway places, such as Singapore, Los Angeles
and Montreal, and that such training rarely involves fewer than two staff. The



9
A/59/419

Committee urges the mission to send fewer staff to each training venue and to
implement train-the-trainer programmes and video training where feasible.
Consideration should also be given to innovations to regionalize training, given
the existence of three missions in relatively close proximity. Training
consultants might be used to train mission staff in all three missions in the
region, for example, or new UNOCI staff might be sent to UNAMSIL for
training.

33. Furthermore, while the Advisory Committee recognizes that training needs are
greater during the start-up phase of a mission, it points out that many of the
international staff to be employed at UNOCI have come from other missions and
therefore most likely have undergone some training. The Committee was informed
upon enquiry that the training undergone by staff transferring from one mission to
another was not systematically tracked. The Committee sees no reason why a
tracking system should not be put in place immediately for all missions,
particularly in view of the fact that each international staff member assigned to
a mission must complete a personal history form. In the case of UNOCI, the
Committee notes that there is a Training Unit in the Office of the Chief of
Administrative Services, which could handle such tracking for the mission. The
Committee requests that efforts made in this regard be reflected in the
proposed budgets for all peacekeeping operations.

Consultants

34. The proposed budget includes a provision in the amount of $245,000 for
consultants that are to be engaged for the Operation’s training programme, as well
as for the training of local journalists in core journalistic techniques and practices.
The Advisory Committee requested additional information concerning the extent to
which the use of in-house expertise might reduce requirements under this budget
line. It was informed that the requirement for training consultants (see para. 32
above) could be reduced by $17,600. If the estimate for training consultants is
reduced, an amount of $3,400 would need to be transferred from the budget line for
consultants to training fees, supplies and services, which falls under other supplies,
services and equipment. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the
estimate for consultants be reduced by $21,000 and the estimate for other
supplies, services and equipment be increased by $3,400.

Official travel

35. Official travel for purposes other than training is estimated at $1,099,659 for
the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. Of that amount, $607,514 relates to
travel by Headquarters staff to the mission area. The Advisory Committee notes
from the supplementary information provided to it that a large amount of such travel
is attributable to the Logistics Support Division ($156,998) and the Administrative
Support Division ($102,390). The Committee considers the amount requested for
official travel to be excessive and reminds the mission that responsibility for
authorizing unforeseen travel requests rests with the Chief Administrative
Officer, who should closely monitor travel both within and outside the mission
area. As it has with training, the Committee requests the Secretariat to look
into the possibility of regionalization of travel for technical and administrative
support from Headquarters to cover neighbouring missions at the same time,
thereby limiting the number of trips.



10

A/59/419

Facilities and infrastructure

36. The Advisory Committee was informed that a site had been found to
accommodate the integrated mission headquarters in Abidjan. Grounds clearing and
reconstruction of the former Hotel Sebroko was under way and it was expected that
staff could begin moving in late in December 2004 or early in January 2005. Aside
from the hotel buildings, there will be containers on the grounds and a level-one
medical clinic. The Committee was informed that the compound was quite secure.
The Committee welcomes the progress made in this respect and notes that the
integrated headquarters may lead to substantial savings in the long term.

Air operations

37. As noted in paragraph 18 above, the aviation transport unit shown on the
organization chart for the military component of the mission (see A/59/289, annex,
sect. C) and the eight military helicopters associated with it have not been deployed
and, although it has been budgeted for beginning 1 October 2004, it is unlikely that
the unit will be in place before the end of December 2004. The Committee
therefore recommends that the estimate for air operations be reduced by
$4,554,700, corresponding to the amount budgeted for eight military
helicopters for the three-month period from 1 October to 31 December 2004.

Quick-impact projects

38. An amount of $800,000 is included in the estimates for the period from 1 July
2004 to 30 June 2005 for quick-impact projects. Upon enquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that 14 projects at an estimated cost of $139,662 had been
recommended for approval by the Selection Committee (see annex III).

Information technology

39. The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information provided
to it that 226 items of information technology equipment are to be written off by
30 June 2005. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that these consisted of 82
computers and 82 monitors transferred from MONUC and the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), 29 monitors transferred from the United
Nations Mission in Côte d’Ivoire (MINUCI) and 40 printers transferred from
UNMIK, all of which are at least four years old. Also included is a UPS 5KVA
uninterrupted power supply device, which was damaged in a car accident, and two
pass and identification systems originally purchased by the United Nations
Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which are nearly 11 years old. The latter have
become faulty and do not comply with the systems used in UNOCI.

IV. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

40. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 is indicated in
paragraph 97 of the proposed budget (A/59/289). Taking into account its
recommendations in paragraphs 18, 29, 31, 34 and 37 above, the Advisory
Committee recommends that the estimated budget requirements of
$384,350,400 for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 be reduced by
$5,877,600. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the General



11

A/59/419

Assembly appropriate an amount of $378,472,800 gross ($372,129,600 net) for
the maintenance of UNOCI for the period, in addition to the amount of
$200,646,600 already appropriated under the terms of General Assembly
resolution 58/310.
