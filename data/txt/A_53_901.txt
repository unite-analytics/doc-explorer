Support account for peacekeeping operations

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and recalls that in a previous report (A/52/892, para. 2), it
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the recommended that in future the vacancy factor for support
Secretary-General on the financial performance of the support account posts be increased from 5 per cent to 8 per cent (see
account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 para. 9 below).
July 1997 to 30 June 1998 (A/53/854). The Committee has
also considered the report of the Secretary-General on the
estimated requirements for the support account for the period
from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 (A/53/854/Add.1). During
its consideration of the reports, the Committee met with the
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations and
other representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided
additional information and clarifications.

Financial performance report for the period
from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998

2. The General Assembly, in its resolution 51/239 A of 17
June 1997, authorized an amount of $32.4 million for post (a
total staffing establishment of 346 posts) and non-post
requirements for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998.
The expenditures for that period amounted to $28.5 million,
resulting in an unutilized balance of $3.9 million. As
indicated in the performance report (A/53/854, para. 20), the
unutilized balance is largely the result of savings under staff
costs arising from the higher rate of post vacancy (8.8 per
cent) than budgeted (5 per cent) and from variances between
standard costs and actual costs experienced. The Committee

3. The performance report (paras. 3–17) provides a
description of major developments related to backstopping
for peacekeeping operations. The Committee welcomes this
information although it should have been more analytical and
should have explained important administrative issues which
had impacted on the implementation of the approved budget
under the support account, as recommended by the Committee
(A/52/892, para. 4). The Committee was assured that it was
the intention of the Secretariat to improve the document by
implementing the Committee’s recommendation in the next
budget submission.
4. The Committee commends the Secretariat for measures
to better monitor the use of the support account resources. At
the same time, the Committee points out that information
included in the performance report should have provided a
better explanation of the variances in the budget
implementation under both staff and non-staff budget lines
and their impact on backstopping activities. The Committee
requests that the next performance report on the support
account provide such an explanation.

Cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1999 to
30 June 2000

6. The Secretary-General estimates support account
resource requirements for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30
June 2000 at $36,065,600 (net), which would mainly provide
for the staffing of 406 temporary posts, reflecting a proposed
increase of 6 posts compared with the current staffing table.
7. The Committee notes an improvement in the format and
content of the Secretary-General’s proposed budget. The
report is more concise and it has been submitted on time. The
structure of the report has improved and the report contains
fewer errors and omissions, compared with the previous
report (A/52/837 and Corr.1); it also includes important
workload statistics for prior periods. The Committee notes
an improvement in the quality and timeliness of receipt from
the Secretariat of information requested by the Committee.
However, information requested by the Committee on the
functional description and grade levels of posts was not
received.
8. The Committee is of the view that future improvements
should be geared towards further streamlining of the report
without compromising the quality of the information and the
necessary details required. There is also a need to provide
more analysis and to improve wherever possible the
relationship between workload and resources requested. For
example, performance workload statistics for prior periods
could be included in the performance report, while the
proposed budget should reflect mostly estimates of the current
and anticipated workload as well as proposed activities.
9. The Committee notes from the report (A/53/854/Add.1,
para. 2) that a vacancy turnover factor of 5 per cent for
Professional staff and 2.5 per cent for General Service staff
has been applied in the costing exercise. The Committee was
informed that a great effort had been made to fill vacant
support account posts in view of the phasing out of the gratis
personnel. The Committee was provided with statistics on the
incumbency situation (see annex I to the present report) which
show that the vacancy rate in the category of Professional staff
during the current budget period varied from 10.1 per cent
(during July and September 1998) to 33.6 per cent (during
November 1998) and in the category of General Service staff

10. In response to observations and recommendations of
the General Assembly and the Committee, the report provides
information on the structure and functions of the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations (paras. 6 to 22), on the
relationship between that Department and the Department of
Political Affairs (paras. 23 to 31) and on the roles and
responsibilities of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations and the Department of Management in the
provision of administrative support to peacekeeping
operations (paras. 32 to 34).
11. As indicated in paragraph 6 of the report, a new
structure of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is
being put in place, which will result in the consolidation of
military expertise in a newly created Military and Civilian
Police Division, the transformation of the Office of Planning
and Support into the Office of Logistics, Management and
Mine Action, the completion of the transfer of the Situation
Centre to the Office of Operations, the integration of the
Policy Analysis Unit and the Lessons Learned Unit under the
direct authority of the Under-Secretary-General and the
consolidation and rationalization of the structure of the Field
Administration and Logistics Division. The Committee was
informed that the Secretariat intended to bring this matter to
the attention of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping
Operations. The Advisory Committee trusts that the General
Assembly will have the benefit of the views of that Committee
by the time it takes up the support account.
12. The Committee notes from paragraph 13 of the report
that following the recent phase-out of gratis personnel those
military officers who remained were thinly spread across
several small units. In the new structure, military personnel
are consolidated in the new Military and Civilian Police
Division, which consists of the Military Adviser’s Office, the
Military Planning Service, the Civilian Police Unit and the
Training Unit. According to the Secretary-General, this will
enhance leadership and guidance. The Committee further
notes the statement that “with all military personnel now
working in one Division, it is essential to ensure that the
Military and Civilian Police Division is fully integrated with
the rest of the Department”. The Under-Secretary-General
for Peacekeeping Operations informed the Committee that a
coordinating mechanism is being established to address the
potential risk of disconnection between military and civilian

divested of the Information and Research Unit and is
responsible now for three main functions, namely, (a)
maintaining round-the-clock communications with the field;
(b) collecting and disseminating timely and relevant
information, including maintaining statistics on peacekeeping
operations; and (c) providing crisis management facilities.
The Committee was informed that the Secretariat will rely on
Member States for some of the information previously
provided by the Information and Research Unit. The
Committee was also informed that the proposed staffing for
the Centre of 15 Professional and 3 General Service staff is
the minimum required to keep it operational 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. The Committee requests the Secretary-
General to inquire more intensively into opportunities for
cooperation among facilities with a compatible purpose in
other entities of the United Nations system in New York.
20. The Committee was provided with additional
information on the functions performed by the 18 staff of the
Situation Centre (see annex II to the present report). While
the Committee notes the new arrangement concerning the
Centre, it is of the view that its staff should not perform
functions which should normally be assigned to desk officers
of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the
Department of Political Affairs. Moreover, the feasibility
should be examined of more widely disseminating information
gathered by the Centre.
21. The Committee requested clarification with regard to through redeployment, should be an additional post.
the outstanding tasks remaining for completed and closed
peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 1999 to
30 June 2000, as described in section V of the Secretary-
General’s report; it also requested an estimate of the
outstanding workload and the related staff resources that
would be required for the work. The Committee was provided
with additional information (see annex III to the present
report) which however dealt only with tasks to be performed
by the Field Administration and Logistics Division and
provided the estimates only in respect of the Logistics and
Communications Service (133 person-months).
22. From this information and testimony by representatives
of the Secretary-General and from the report of the Board of
Auditors, the Committee concludes that a critical evaluation1
should be made of the efficiency of the units handling the
outstanding tasks throughout the Secretariat. There is a need

23. As indicated in paragraph 6 above, the Secretary-
General proposes the staffing of 406 support account posts,
a net increase of 6 posts. The Committee was informed that
the level of resources requested in the context of the support
account budget for the year 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 is
adequate to provide backstopping for peacekeeping activities.
The representatives of the Secretary-General indicated that
they would request additional resources should the need arise.
24. In its post-by-post review of the proposed staffing
requirements for the current budget period, the Committee
recommended that 393 support account posts be established,
29 of them through redeployment from within the existing
support account establishment throughout the Secretariat (see
A/53/418). The General Assembly in its resolution 53/12
authorized 400 posts. With regard to the Rapidly Deployable
Mission Headquarters, the staffing requirements of which
were examined by the Committee in 1998, the Committee had
agreed that those posts were needed; it recommended,
however, that six of those posts be filled through
redeployment from within the existing support account
establishment throughout the Secretariat. The General
Assembly, in paragraph 8 of its resolution 53/12, decided to
revert to the issue of these six posts on the basis of additional
information requested. The General Assembly also decided
that one post for the Office of Internal Oversight Services,
which the Committee had recommended should be provided

25. Of the 22 posts remaining to be provided through
redeployment, the Secretariat has identified 16 posts as

context of the reduction in the level of peacekeeping current support account staffing of 400 posts be maintained
activities, it must also be seen against the phasing out of gratis for the budget period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000; the
personnel, which has resulted in a significant reduction in the Committee reiterates its previous recommendation that the
number of overall personnel backstopping peacekeeping need for six additional posts for the Rapidly Deployable
operations. The Committee was provided with the following Mission Headquarters should be accommodated through
statistics on backstopping personnel, including both support redeployment within the existing support account
account posts and gratis personnel (when appropriate), for establishment throughout the Secretariat (see para. 24 above).
backstopping United Nations peacekeeping operations:

1995–1996 530

1996–1997 485
1997–1998 486
1998–1999 400a

1999–2000 406

Excluding gratis personnel phased out between 1 July 1998a
and 28 February 1999.

28. According to the Secretariat, there is no direct link
between the number and size of peacekeeping operations and
the number of support account posts. However, as pointed out
by the Committee (A/53/418, para.7), a substantial
diminution in peacekeeping operations must have a
significant impact on backstopping requirements not only for
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations but also for other
departments. The Committee points out that the overall level
of peacekeeping troops has declined from a high of 73,200
in 1994 to 20,500 in 1998 and the budgets from more than
$3 billion to about $1 billion, respectively. Moreover, the
delegation of authority to the field and the use of new
technology should affect the level of support for peacekeeping
operations at Headquarters. The Committee was informed by
the representative of the Secretary-General that there is room
for more delegation of authority to the field. The Committee
requests that the effect of these changes be analysed and
reflected in the context of the next budget submission.
29. The Committee points out that the challenge before the
Secretariat is to identify more clearly the optimum capacity
needed for Headquarters to maintain support for the current
missions, to launch new missions and to perform liquidation
functions for immediately or previously terminated missions.
Upon inquiry, the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations acknowledged that it was not currently possible
to determine, for example, what would be the optimum
military capacity required at Headquarters. In the opinion of
the Committee, that optimum can only be determined after the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations has had the
experience of adjusting to the phase-out of gratis personnel.
Under the circumstances, the Committee recommends that the

30. The Committee notes that the budget has no provision
for staff assessment. The Committee was informed that since
the cost of the support account is currently absorbed within
the appropriation of each peacekeeping mission, staff
assessment is provided from within those appropriations. The
salaries for support account staff are calculated on a net basis
so as not to duplicate the requirement for staff assessment.
Any reimbursement of taxes is charged to the Tax
Equalization Fund. The Committee recalls that a similar
approach to staff assessment was taken in the preparation of
the budget for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi,
in respect of which the Committee has recommended that,
commencing with the budget for the biennium 2000–2001,
the standard procedures for dealing with staff assessment be
applied. The Committee requests that this recommendation
should also apply to the support account.
31. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in
connection with the financing of the support account for the
12-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 are set out
in paragraph 35 of the report (A/53/854/Add.1). In view of
its observations and recommendations set out above (see, in
particular, para. 29), the Committee recommends that the
General Assembly approve the overall staffing of 400
temporary posts. Accordingly, and taking into account
paragraph 9 above, the Committee further recommends that
the General Assembly approve total staffing and non-staffing
requirements of $34,887,100 under the support account for
the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000. Moreover, as
recommended in paragraph 5 above, the unencumbered
balance of $3,865,800 for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30
June 1998 should be applied to resources required for the
support account for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June
2000. The balance to be prorated among the individual active
peacekeeping operation budgets to meet the requirements of
the support account for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30
June 2000 amounts to $31,021,300.

Notes

&

Operations officers include a mix of civilian and military personnel to reflect the skills and
knowledge required in the area of peacekeeping.
&

Staffing of the duty room is done on a 24-hour basis, 7 days a week, ensuring continuous
coverage and continuity. Shifts are approximately 12.5 hours long (including 15 minutes overlap
at the beginning and end of shifts). Two officers are on duty at all times.
&

To operate a shift system of this nature normally requires 13 operations officers. Ten positions
are currently located to this function. The calculation is as follows: A year includes 24 x 365
hours = 8,760 hours. A United Nations employee operating under normal conditions works 46
weeks x 37.5 hours, less 10 holidays, for a total of 1,635 hours. This produces a requirement for
5 1/3 persons per position. At least one additional person-year is required per position to reflect
rotation of personnel and consequent gaps, training, illness, and the consequences of having
operations officers working nights at least half of their time on the job.

Annex III
Outstanding tasks to be completed by the Field Administration
and Logistics Division

Finance Management and Support Service
The Standard Ratios and Standard Cost Manual for peacekeeping operations is updated by
the Systems and Data Analysis Unit. A full review of the Manual is currently outstanding.
Additional work hours are required to maintain and enhance the peacekeeping database and
other automated tools for claims processing.

Logistics and Communications Service
The Service is limited by its inability to conduct proactive management planning; it is now
almost wholly in reactive mode.
Review and updating of logistics policy and procedure documents have been postponed
indefinitely.
Slow technical reviews in support of Headquarters-level procurement action, coupled with
inadequate resources to determine the most cost-effective means of meeting mission support
requirements, have led to delayed, less effective and sometimes more expensive responses
to missions’ support requirements.
Slow technical reviews of cost estimates subsequently resulting in late budget submissions.
Contract closeouts for various liquidated missions have not been completed, and are subject
to further delays.
Work remains outstanding on 17 memoranda of understanding for the implementation of new
reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment.
Delays in provision and installation of communications and electronic data-processing
technical support to users at both Headquarters and mission levels.
Increasing delays in the implementation of new cost-saving transport-related projects, such
as disposal of vehicles, global contract for batteries and tyres, container management,
memorandum of understanding with the World Food Programme for ship chartering.
Delays in producing revised specifications and finalization of new engineering support
services contract for the upcoming three-year period.
Development of common engineering standards and specifications — postponed indefinitely.
It is estimated that, at the time of writing, about 11 person-years of additional effort would
be required to complete the tasks presented above, broken down as follows:

Electronic support services 34 person-months
Engineering 27 person-months
Logistics operations 24 person-months
Supply 20 person-months
Transport 28 person-months

Total, Logistics and Communications Service 133 person-months

Personnel Management and Support Service
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service, its operations are more reactive than
proactive: a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management
would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational
and administrative needs in the field.
On the basis of the results of a workload audit conducted within the Service during the period
from October 1997 to February 1998, Professional staff devoted an average of 20.5 per cent
of time above and beyond the normal work week to maintain the level of services it has been
providing to field missions. Despite these efforts, the Service currently lists the following
tasks as outstanding work to be completed:
& Applications management — review of applications and entry of suitable candidates

into a peacekeeping database for consideration in connection with vacancies as they
occur (estimated at approximately 4,650 applications).
& Delays in maintenance of staff records, which create difficulties in personnel

management and administration.
& Delays of up to one year in reviewing/processing recommendations received from field

missions.
& Delays in preparation of standard operating procedures to permit further delegation

of authority to the field and streamlining of administrative processing (e.g., special post
allowances; appointment and administration of staff, including proper induction;
measures to ensure proper payment of salary and disbursement of reimburseable loan
payments for staff assigned to the field). Although the personnel section of the draft
Field Administration Handbook is progressing, this project should have been completed
several years ago. Owing to staffing constraints the Service also experiences difficulty
in maintaining an effective monitoring of the exercise of delegated authority by field
missions, including administrative practices, to ensure a correct and consistent
application of policies in the field, as well as in ensuring full follow-up to audit
observations and drawing and acting on appropriate “lessons learned” and the sharing
of best administrative practices.
& Delays in completing the restructuring of the Field Service category, as required to both

revitalize the category and meet emerging operational needs. It should be noted that
the Office of Internal Oversight Services conducted an audit of the Field Service
category in 1998, in which it highlighted a number of priority matters requiring
attention.
& Delay in conducting the annual Field Service promotion review.
& Delays in the review and processing of compensation claims of civilian personnel,

military observers and civilian police and in following up with the Advisory Board on
Compensation Claims in cases of death, disability or loss of personal effects. Such cases
can take between six months and more than one year to settle.
& Delays in reviewing organizational structures and job descriptions of established

missions, required to reflect changing requirements and operational needs.
