Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations

Financial performance report for the period from
1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 and proposed budget for
the support account for peacekeeping operations for
the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the
support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30
June 2002 (A/57/725) and the report of the Secretary-General on the estimated
requirements for the support account for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June
2004 (A/57/732). The Committee also had before it the reports of the Secretary-
General on experience with resident investigators in peacekeeping operations
(A/57/494) and on gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping activities (A/57/731).
During its consideration of these reports, the Committee met with the
representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and
clarification.

I. Format and presentation

2. In accordance with paragraphs 6 to 14 of the budget report (A/57/732), an
attempt has been made to improve the presentation in results-based format, as
requested by the Advisory Committee (see A/56/941) and the General Assembly
(see resolution 56/293). One overall objective, instead of the previous 18, has been
specified, namely, “to ensure efficient and effective peacekeeping” (A/57/732,
para. 9). Four expected accomplishments have been designated for the offices
concerned, as set out in paragraph 11 of the budget document. According to
information provided by the representatives of the Secretary-General, the indicators
of achievement have been reduced from 92 to 56, 11 of them have target



2
A/57/776

benchmarks (in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations) and 55 per cent of the
outputs have been quantified, compared with the previous 14 per cent.

3. The Committee welcomes the above-mentioned changes and encourages
all concerned in the Secretariat to further refine the presentation in order to
make it more user-friendly. In addition, the Committee believes that further
improvements should be made. As stated further below, the Committee found,
in many cases, the indicators of achievement and outputs to be general and
vague. The Committee requests that they be drafted in a way that facilitates
monitoring and reporting on performance and that additional efforts be made
to provide time frames for the completion of outputs.

4. Furthermore, the link between resources, expected accomplishments and
outputs should be more apparent (see, for example, para. 83 below). The
absence of such links makes it difficult to evaluate the adequacy or otherwise of
proposed resources in terms of outputs, expected accomplishments and
attainment of stated objectives in a specified time frame.

5. As with the budgets for peacekeeping missions, the supplementary
information on the support account provided to the Advisory Committee was
scattered in several attachments, making it difficult for the Committee to
quickly understand what the Secretariat was proposing and the reasons
therefor. The Committee requests that, in future, the information provided to it
follow the structure of the main budget document and indicate budget
variances as well as changes in the content of the results-based framework.
Changes in outputs could indicate productivity and efficiency in implementing
the budget or inefficiencies in the use of available resources. Such information
can be provided to the Committee, in writing, before it starts to examine the
budget estimates.

6. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the resources presented
under the various organizational units of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations and other organizational units concerned should be comprehensive
and consistent, in order to permit scrutiny of trends in resource use, as well as
comparison with the estimated resources for the upcoming period. In cases
where the Secretariat allocates and manages resources centrally, rather than by
organizational unit, the procedure should be applied consistently from one
period to another and clearly explained in the proposed estimates.

7. The Advisory Committee further notes that the performance report for
the support account for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002, in the
absence of a baseline, is presented in a transitional format, as was done with
those for the peacekeeping missions. In the preparation of the budget
performance report for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003, as well as
future periods, the Committee recommends that the reporting on the
achievement of expected accomplishments and results be based on the
organizational units, in line with the results-based framework contained in the
related budget document.

8. The Advisory Committee strongly reiterates its views on the need for
adequate justification and for clear definition of realistic objectives and
attainable expected accomplishments, as stated in paragraphs 8 and 9 and 11 to
13 of its report A/56/941. The Committee trusts that more progress and



3
A/57/776

improvements will be indicated in the next submission for the support account.
The Committee has also made comments and observations in its general report
on peacekeeping operations (A/57/772).

II. Financial performance report for the period from 1 July
2001 to 30 June 2002

9. The Advisory Committee recalls that the total support account resources for
post and non-post requirements, approved for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June
2002, amounted to $89,749,200 gross ($79,251,300 net), including a total
establishment of 687 posts (see General Assembly resolutions 55/271, 56/241 and
56/255).

10. As indicated in the performance report (A/57/725), the expenditures for the
period amounted to $84,343,000 gross ($73,328,000 net), resulting in an
unencumbered balance of $5,406,200 gross ($5,923,300 net) — in gross terms, 6 per
cent of the resources approved for the period.

11. The Advisory Committee notes that the unencumbered balance was
attributable essentially to the fact that the actual vacancy rate for the reporting
period was higher than the budgeted rate. As indicated in paragraph 6 of A/57/725, a
vacancy factor of 8 per cent for Professional posts and of 2.5 per cent for General
Service posts had been budgeted for the 562 continuing posts approved for the
period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 by General Assembly resolution 55/271.
The actual vacancy rates were 9.1 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. For the
additional 125 posts approved for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2002 by
General Assembly resolutions 56/241 and 56/255, full incumbency was applied for
the 91 posts in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and a 50 per cent
delayed recruitment factor was applied to the remaining 34 posts in other
departments and offices. The actual vacancy rate in the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations was 9.7 per cent, and it averaged 29.6 per cent in the other departments
and offices (see A/57/725, paras. 6 and 7). The related savings amounted to
$2,531,300, out of resources of $70,039,400 approved for posts.

12. Savings in respect of official travel ($268,400), communications ($353,200)
and information technology ($1,789,000) are also shown in section II A and briefly
described in section III of the performance report. The Committee’s comments on
the information contained in the performance report on individual objects of
expenditure can be found, where relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget
for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 in section IV below.

III. Information on performance for the current period

13. The Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in its resolution 56/293 of
27 June 2002, approved an amount of $100,896,200 gross ($87,156,900 net) for
support account post and non-post resources for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30
June 2003, approving a total staffing establishment of 702 temporary posts.

14. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that expenditures as at 28
February 2003 amounted to $60,511,300 (see annex).



4
A/57/776

15. Of the 702 posts currently approved (427 Professional, 272 General Service
and 3 security), as at 28 February 2003 a total of 643 were encumbered (376
Professional, 264 General Service and 3 security).

IV. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2003 to
30 June 2004

16. The Secretary-General, in his report A/57/732, estimates support account
resources for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 at $115,863,100 gross
($100,318,500 net), which would provide for the staffing of 761 temporary support
account posts.

17. As indicated in the financial resources table in the summary and paragraphs 4
and 5 of A/57/732, the amount proposed, in gross terms, represents an increase of
$14,996,900, or 14.8 per cent ($13,161,600 in net terms), over the $100,896,200
gross ($87,156,900 net) approved for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.
Most of the increase is due to the changes in standard salary costs ($4.5 million) and
the inclusion under the support account of 27 posts for resident auditors ($3.8
million), previously funded under individual peacekeeping budgets. Other reasons
for the increase include the proposal for the establishment of a regional investigator
capacity in Nairobi and Vienna ($1.9 million), a resident auditor office in Kuwait
City ($0.5 million), additional posts at Headquarters ($2.3 million), upgrading of
information and communications technology support ($1.6 million) and training
($0.4 million).

18. The overall resources estimated for posts ($92,162,100) take into account the
proposed establishment of 59 additional support account posts. These include 3 new
posts in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, a total of 49 posts in the Office
of Internal Oversight Services (27 for resident auditors redeployed from the budgets
of peacekeeping operations, 12 for regional investigators in Nairobi and Vienna, 4
for the resident auditor’s office in Kuwait, 3 for the Monitoring, Evaluation and
Consulting Division and 3 for the Executive Office), and 7 posts in the Department
of Management (2 in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General, 2 in the Treasury
Division and 3 in the Office of Human Resources Management). Two
reclassifications are proposed (from P-3 to P-4 in the Office of Programme
Planning, Budget and Accounts and from P-4 to P-5 in the Procurement Division).
The Advisory Committee’s recommendation on these posts is set out further below.

19. The Advisory Committee further notes that delayed recruitment and staff
turnover factors of 6.5 per cent and 3.1 per cent have been applied to continuing
posts in the Professional and General Service categories, respectively, and of 50 per
cent and 35 per cent for all new posts in the Professional and General Service
categories, respectively, in the costing exercise.

20. Resources for official travel are estimated at $4,389,000, an increase of
$1,147,500 over the $3,241,500 approved for 2002/03. The Advisory Committee
notes that most of the increase in travel relates to the additional resources proposed
under the Office of Internal Oversight Services (see para. 71 below). Total travel
expenditures amounted to $560,200 during 2001/02. The savings reported for that
period ($268,400), indicated in paragraph 12 above, resulted mostly from the fact
that requirements related to the surveys on comprehensive and interim salary and



5
A/57/776

mission subsistence allowance were less than estimated, and to the cancellation of a
number of monitoring visits by the Office of Human Resources Management to
peacekeeping missions, resulting from the delay in the development of the
monitoring frameworks. The Committee notes that the framework has in fact been
developed and is presented in the Secretary-General’s report on monitoring capacity
in the Office of Human Resources Management (A/57/276).

21. A provision of $865,500 is proposed for communications for 2003/04, an
increase of 1.1 per cent over the $856,400 approved for 2002/03. Expenditure of
$282,000 is reported for 2001/02. An amount of $7,169,600 is proposed for
information technology, an increase of $1,645,500, or 29.8 per cent, over the
$5,524,100 approved for 2002/03. Of that total, $6,163,100 relates to the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (see para. 41 below). Expenditure of
$4,462,100 is reported for 2001/02. The savings of $1,789,000 reported during that
period were due mostly to the reduced level of maintenance and support services
provided to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and utilization of in-house
resources for the development of specialized application software (see A/57/725,
para. 13).

22. The Advisory Committee has made comments and observations with regard to
communications and information technology in its general report on peacekeeping
operations and in the individual budget reports of peacekeeping missions. In this
regard, the Committee reiterates the need for clearly identified and properly
planned estimates for communications and information technology, as well as
the need to take advantage of potential synergies available through cooperation
with the Information Technology Services Division.

23. The $842,500 proposed for general temporary assistance for 2003/04
represents an increase of 33.7 per cent over the $630,000 approved for 2002/03.
Expenditure in 2001/02 was $579,600, with savings of $188,700 reported (see
A/57/725, para. 8). Most of the increase for 2003/04 results from the related
resources proposed for the Department of Management ($192,100). The Committee
notes that these resources, which are used to provide support during maternity or
extended sick leave, are also used for peak workload services. Combined with the
$1,218,300 proposed for consultants (a decrease of $1,907,600 from the amount
approved for 2002/03), these resources provide the Secretariat with additional
capacity to supplement staff resources allocated from the support account.

24. As indicated above, the total support account resources of $115.9 million
proposed for 2003/04 constitute an increase of 15 per cent over the resources for
2002/03 and an increase of 29 per cent over the resources for 2001/02. These figures
exclude the resources for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi. As shown in
table 1 of the Secretary-General’s overview of the financing of peacekeeping
operations (A/57/723), the numbers of military and civilian personnel for 2003/04
are lower than for 2002/03, and the budget level is lower. While the Advisory
Committee agrees that a direct link between the size and/or complexity of
peacekeeping operations and the level of the support account is difficult to
establish, the overall level of financing of the support account and of the
Logistics Base is still a matter of concern to the Committee. The Committee is
of the opinion that if the decrease in peacekeeping operations were to continue,
it would be difficult, during the next period, to justify the current levels of the
support account and the Logistics Base.



6
A/57/776

25. At a time when the Organization is investing increasing resources in
communications and information technology, as well as in training for
peacekeeping activities and support, the Advisory Committee expects that the
consequent greater efficiency and productivity in processes and the delivery of
services, combined with decreases in peacekeeping operations, should lead to
lower demands for staff and non-staff resources, including travel costs for the
support account. The Committee has taken this view into account in its
examination of the resources for the various units funded from the support
account, and its recommendations regarding post and non-post resources are
set out further below.

Department of Peacekeeping Operations

26. The support account resources for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 amount to $77,333,500 in gross
terms — an increase of $4,392,100 (6 per cent) over the appropriation of
$72,941,400 for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 (see A/57/732, sect.
II.A.7 (b)). This is due mostly to changes in standard salary costs, as indicated in
paragraph 17 above, and the proposal to establish three additional posts: one D-1 for
a chief of the Communications and Information Technology Service (see para. 37
below); one P-5 for a senior gender adviser (see para. 30 below); and one General
Service post (ibid.).

27. The Advisory Committee recalls that in accordance with the request of the
General Assembly contained in paragraph 18 of its resolution 56/241 of 24
December 2001, the Office of Internal Oversight Services will undertake an
evaluation of the overall impact of the restructuring implemented by the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations on its backstopping of peacekeeping operations, as well
as the impact on the efficient and effective use of resources entrusted to it. The
report on this matter will be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth
session.

28. The Advisory Committee was informed that of the 537 posts currently
approved for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (334 Professional and 203
General Service), as at 24 February 2003 there were 46 vacancies (43 Professional
and 3 General Service). The Committee is of the opinion that the delay in filling
the D-2 post for the Director of Management in the Office of the Under-
Secretary-General and the D-2 post in the Office of Mission Support is
unacceptable, and points to the continuing problem of unnecessary delays in
the recruitment and placement of personnel. Moreover, it is notable that these
delays are fraught with potential negative impacts on peacekeeping missions
and on the relevant services of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
itself. The Committee refers to this issue in its general report on peacekeeping
operations.

Office of the Under-Secretary-General

29. The resource requirements for the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations are estimated at $5,368,300 ($174,100, or 3.1 per cent,
over those approved for 2002/03). The increase is due mostly to the changes in
standard salary costs and the proposal for two additional posts. Other increases, for



7
A/57/776

official travel and miscellaneous supplies, services and equipment, are explained in
paragraphs 28 and 29 of A/57/732. These are offset by decreases for consultants and
general temporary assistance.

30. Two new posts are proposed to be established under the Peacekeeping Best
Practices Unit: a P-5 post for a senior gender adviser and a related General Service
post to carry out the functions described in paragraphs 22 and 23 of A/57/732. The
Advisory Committee recalls its recommendation against the establishment of the P-5
post until an adequate rationale for it is provided and a more coherent policy is
developed (see A/56/941, para. 24). During its consideration of this matter, the
Committee had before it the report of the Secretary-General on gender
mainstreaming in peacekeeping activities (A/57/731). The Committee exchanged
views with the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations and with other
representatives of the Secretary-General on the subject. The Committee was
informed that the post would enable the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to
implement an integrated, coherent gender-mainstreaming programme and relevant
activities in peacekeeping missions, in line with the Organization’s policy on gender
mainstreaming.

31. While the Advisory Committee agrees that a post should be provided for
the gender adviser functions, it is not convinced of the need for it to be at the
P-5 level. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the post be set at the
P-4 level. Moreover, the Committee notes that there are currently 21 General
Service posts in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General, of which 2 are funded
under the regular budget. The Committee therefore does not recommend the
establishment of the additional General Service post. Accordingly, non-staff
resources for this Office should be reduced by $9,600. In making these
recommendations, the Committee points out that the role of the Office of the
Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women in gender
mainstreaming is still not clear. The Committee intends to follow up on this
issue in the context of its regular budget review.

Office of Operations

32. The financial resources of $8,003,400 proposed for the Office of Operations
represent an increase of $501,900, or 6.7 per cent, over those approved for 2002/03.
The increase is due to the changes in the standard salary costs. The Advisory
Committee notes that the Office has a staffing table of 79 posts, of which 60 are
funded from the support account (45 Professional and 15 General Service) and 19
from the regular budget (14 Professional and 5 General Service).

33. The Advisory Committee noted minor changes in the results-based
framework vis-à-vis the presentation contained in the previous Secretary-
General’s report (A/56/885). Only 14 outputs, rather than 16, are indicated in
A/57/732. However, these are so general and at such a high level of aggregation
as to limit the understanding of the link between the proposed resources and
the results-based framework. The Committee requests that greater efforts be
made in the next submission to better justify the resources for the Office of
Operations.

34. The Advisory Committee was informed that non-post resources for the Office
of Operations are accounted for centrally, as part of the resources allotted to the
Executive Office of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. A provision for



8
A/57/776

$50,000 is proposed for official travel, which is the same amount approved for
2002/03. The Committee was informed that expenditures as at 15 March 2003
amounted to $30,800.

Office of Mission Support

35. The Advisory Committee recognizes the attempt to be more specific about
outputs and indicators of achievement in the results-based presentation of the Office
of Mission Support. This improvement should be enhanced in the context of the next
submission for the support account. In this connection, however, the Committee
notes that the presentation for the Office of Mission Support for 2003/04 groups its
two divisions together (the Logistics Support Division and the Administrative
Support Division), whereas the budget report for 2002/03 (A/56/885) presented the
resources separately. The Committee is of the view that a consistent presentation
from budget to budget is desirable, since it enables trends in staff and non-staff
resources to be assessed (see para. 6 above).

36. The resources proposed for the Office of Mission Support amount to
$40,014,300, an increase of $1,901,100, or 5 per cent, over the resources approved
for 2002/03. The increase is due to additional requirements of $2,175,600 (6 per
cent) for posts, in view of the changes in standard salary costs and the proposal for
one new post, making a total of 332 support account posts. The increase for posts is
offset by a decrease of 29.3 per cent for consultants, in view of the completion of
outputs in the Personnel Management and Support Service, and of 11.7 per cent for
miscellaneous supplies, services and equipment (see A/57/732, sect. II.A.3(c)).

37. The functions of the proposed additional post of chief of the Communications
and Information Technology Service are indicated in paragraph 34 of A/57/732. For
the reasons stated therein, and because of the importance of the functions
involved, the Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the proposal to
establish the post of chief of the Communications and Information Technology
Service at the D-1 level.

38. A provision for $750,500, at the maintenance level, is proposed for official
travel. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 37 of A/57/732 that this
includes $240,000 for attendance at seminars and conferences and $510,500 for
training-related travel. In view of the resources available for attendance at
seminars and conferences at the mission and Headquarters level, the
Committee recommends reducing resources for that purpose to $100,000
($140,000 less than the amount proposed). Total resources for official travel
would therefore amount to $610,500.

39. A provision for $203,000 is proposed for miscellaneous supplies, services and
equipment (an increase of $27,000 over the resources approved for 2002/03). The
Advisory Committee recommends approval of the $103,000 requested for the
production of training materials. However, the $100,000 requested for
“targeted external advertising for key positions within field missions”
(A/57/732, para. 39) should be absorbed, since in the opinion of the Committee
it represents little more than a contingency provision. Existing facilities of the
United Nations should be fully used, including web resources and United
Nations offices in various capitals. Total resources under this budget item
would therefore amount to $103,000.



9
A/57/776

40. The resources proposed for consultants for 2003/04 amount to $598,000 (a
decrease of $247,500, or 29.3 per cent, relative to those approved for 2002/03).
Details are provided in paragraph 36 of A/57/732. The Advisory Committee
welcomes the intention to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of information
systems management within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The
Committee has commented on the need to undertake a review of the many databases
that have been or are being developed with a view to ensuring their compatibility
and interactiveness and an evaluation of the cost benefits, efficiency and
productivity of information systems of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
(see A/56/887, para. 62). The Committee requests that in-house expertise be used as
much as possible. However, the Committee notes that a provision for $190,000,
related to a “global vehicle spare parts management system” (A/57/732, para. 36) is
included, for which the basis of the request in terms of person-months is not
available, indicating a deficiency in the identification and formulation of needs and
requirements. The Committee also questions the need for outside expertise
($25,000) to reconcile posts and functional titles. Accordingly, and taking into
account the expertise that should be available in the Office of Mission Support
for the functions described in the table in paragraph 36 of A/57/732, the
Committee recommends that $495,000 be approved for consultants ($103,000
less than proposed).

41. The Advisory Committee was informed that, of the total resources proposed
for information technology in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
($6,163,100), $5,700,500 relates to the Office of Mission Support, and includes the
following: $2,402,500 for acquisition of equipment, $498,000 for maintenance and
repair of equipment and $2,800,000 for information technology services.

42. The Advisory Committee recalls that the request for 2002/03 amounted to
$2,195,030 for electronic data-processing equipment and $2,005,000 for electronic
data-processing services, making a total of $4,200,030 (see A/56/885, paras. 37 and
38). The resources proposed for 2003/04 constitute a 26 per cent increase over those
approved for 2002/03. The proposed requirements for acquisition of equipment
would cover the costs of 27 additional items and 334 replacement items at a total
cost of $1,358,000, not including licences and fees ($128,500), software packages
($677,000) and spare parts and supplies ($239,000).

43. The Advisory Committee requested additional information on higher costs for
equipment to be acquired than in 2002/03; however, it was not entirely convinced by
the explanations provided. The Committee recommends that the resources for
additional equipment (excluding software and licences and fees) be reduced to
$1,000,000. The provision for spare parts and supplies should be reduced to
$176,000. Total resources for additional equipment would therefore amount to
$1,981,500, reflecting a reduction of $421,000.

44. The Advisory Committee requests greater clarity in future explanations
provided to support requests for communications and information technology.
In addition, the Secretariat should clearly indicate those services that cannot be
provided in-house, thus requiring external expertise, and those that can be
handled by existing staff. This information would allow a better evaluation by
the Committee of the relevant resources. In this connection, the Committee noted
the savings of $1,536,000 for the Office of Mission Support in the performance
report for 2001/02, resulting from the delay in the implementation of an external



10

A/57/776

service agreement for maintenance support services and the utilization of in-house
resources for the development of specialized-applications software. The Committee
is of the opinion that if expertise exists to develop specialized software, it
should also be available to provide maintenance support. Furthermore, it
should be a matter of policy to ensure, to the extent possible, that the
development and implementation of new applications are accompanied by
adequate training not only for users, but also for those who are to maintain the
applications. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the use of in-house
expertise in the area of development, implementation, maintenance and
support of information technology, whenever possible in cooperation with the
Information Technology Services Division.

45. In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes the explanation contained in
paragraph 53 of A/57/732 as to the $2,800,000 provision for information technology
services for 2003/04. The Committee believes that the extent to which this amount
would be spent depends on progress achieved in the development and
implementation of the various applications indicated therein. The Committee was
informed, for example, that the Integrated Management Information System was
deployed in 10 missions as at December 2002 and that five more missions would be
covered by June 2003. The Committee was also informed that progress, to varying
degrees, had been made in the development and implementation of the other systems
referred to in paragraph 54 of A/57/732. For example, phase II of the E-STARS
application would be released during the first quarter of 2004.

46. The Advisory Committee has noted in the past that the implementation and
release of information technology applications are subject to frequent delays. In
such cases, savings on costs, such as for maintenance, testing and implementation
support, tend to arise. Moreover, the Committee is of the opinion that, with the
downsizing of missions such as the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone
(UNAMSIL) and the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
(UNMISET), it would not be prudent to expand communications and
information technology investment beyond what is required to effectively
implement current and short-term needs.

47. Under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee sees no justification for
requesting resources for electronic data-processing services that are far in
excess of what was estimated for 2002/03. The Committee recommends,
therefore, that the request for services be reduced to $2,000,000 (a reduction of
$800,000).

Military Division

48. The Advisory Committee notes that the results-based framework for the
Military Division shows three expected accomplishments and 20 outputs (the
submission for 2002/03 indicated 24 outputs). The Committee notes that while some
outputs are repeated, others appear to have been omitted, such as the “automated
processes and standardized procedures for management and administration of
individual rotations and repatriations” (A/56/885, table 14). In this regard, the
Committee was informed that the process has been completed and is currently in
use; hence, no provision has been included for 2003/04.



11

A/57/776

49. The Advisory Committee notes from section II.A.4(b) of A/57/732 that no
change is proposed for the number of support account posts: 79 posts (61
Professional and 18 General Service). In addition, 4 regular budget posts (2
Professional and 2 General Service) are proposed. The increase of 5.7 per cent in the
total resources proposed, as compared with those approved for 2002/03 is due
mostly to the changes in salary costs. The Secretary-General, however, is proposing
to establish an “Inspector General capacity within the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations” in order to “provide the Under-Secretary-General with an assessment
and internal evaluation mechanism” (A/57/732, para. 43). The cost of the individual
experts would be funded from consultancy funds ($35,000, as indicated in A/57/732,
para. 41) on an “as and when employed” basis.

50. The Advisory Committee noted also the request in the context of the Office of
Internal Oversight Services for three posts related to the undertaking of oversight
functions with regard to military aspects of peacekeeping (see A/57/732, para. 62,
and para. 59 below). The Committee was informed that the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations “inspectors” would report directly to the Under-Secretary-
General for Peacekeeping Operations, whereas Office of Internal Oversight Services
staff would report directly to the Under-Secretary-General for Office of Internal
Oversight Services.

51. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the $35,000 as special
consultancy funds for the Military Division, for the functions explained in
paragraph 43 of A/57/732. The Committee notes that the services sought in the
Military Division are in the nature of internal evaluation and assessment of
military operations by military experts, rather than inspection services in
terms of the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48/218 B of 29 July
1994. The term "inspectorate” or “inspector general” does not appropriately
reflect the intended use of the consultancy funds and thus should not be used.
The Committee is of the view that the establishment of the Office of Internal
Oversight Services obviated the need to establish separate “inspectorates” in
various Departments of the Secretariat.

52. The Advisory Committee recalls that $1,753,000 was requested for the
Training and Evaluation Service for 2002/03 (see A/56/885, para. 42 and table 16).
However, training does not even appear as an object of expenditure in the overall
resource table for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (see A/57/732, sect.
II.A.7(b)). The Committee was informed that $1,753,000 — the same amount
approved for 2002/03 — would be required for 15 activities to be conducted during
2003/04. The related resources are included under the categories of consultants
($42,000), travel ($1,061,000) and miscellaneous supplies, services and equipment
($650,000). The Committee stresses that training is a priority activity in all
peacekeeping missions, as well as in the context of the support account, and
that resources requested for training should be presented in a planned,
consolidated and transparent manner.

53. The Advisory Committee notes that training in support of national, regional
and international institutions was estimated at $990,000 for 2002/03 and at $971,000
for 2003/04 in the additional information provided to the Committee. The
Committee stresses the need to accord this type of training greater effort and priority
in implementing the training activities of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations.



12

A/57/776

54. The Advisory Committee noted that 19 training activities were conducted
during 2001/02, while it was not possible to fulfil 3 requests (see A/57/725, sect.
IV). However, no information on the total cost for the period is included in the
performance report. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the total cost
for the period was $883,646 (the appropriation was $880,500). The Committee
requests that future performance reports on the support account include
information on training activities, as is being provided in performance reports
for peacekeeping missions.

55. The Advisory Committee was also informed that expenditures for the period
2002/03 as at 13 March 2003 totalled $594,859. However, in view of the events
planned for the period from March to June 2003, it was expected that the balance of
the appropriation would be spent. Despite the information received, the
Committee is not convinced that the balance of $1,158,141 can be entirely spent
in the remainder of the period ending 30 June 2003.

56. Under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends approval
of an amount of $1,500,000 for training (a reduction of $253,000).

Non-staff costs of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations

57. The overall requirements of $11,328,300 for non-staff resources for the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations are summarized in section II.A.7 (b) of
A/57/732. In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that in its analysis of
the proposal for those resources, it has recommended a total reduction of
$1,826,600, which includes $9,600 under the Office of the Under-Secretary-General
(see para. 31 above); $140,000 for official travel (see para. 38 above); $100,000 for
miscellaneous supplies, services and equipment (see para. 39 above); $103,000 for
consultants (see para. 40 above); $1,221,000 for information technology (see paras.
43 and 47 above); and $253,000 for training, which comprises $153,000 for official
travel and $100,000 for miscellaneous services and equipment (see para. 56 above).

Office of Internal Oversight Services

58. The support account resources proposed for the Office of Internal Oversight
Services for 2003/04 amount to $9,386,900, reflecting an increase of $6,841,000
over the resources of $2,545,900 approved for 2002/03. The Advisory Committee
notes that most of the increase results from additional requirements for posts
($5,720,300) and for official travel ($751,500), in view of the proposal to redeploy
the 27 resident auditor posts previously budgeted under peacekeeping missions.

59. It is proposed that support account posts increase from 16 in the 2002/03
budget to 65 for 2003/04. The changes proposed include the following: the transfer
of the 27 resident auditor posts approved for peacekeeping operations for 2002/03
(four P-5, seven P-4, six P-3 and ten General Service) for consolidation under the
support account budget (see A/57/732, paras. 58-62) and the establishment of 22
new posts. These include four posts (one P-5, one P-4, one P-3 and one General
Service (Other level)) for an Office of Internal Oversight Services resident office in
Kuwait to strengthen audit coverage in the Middle East; 12 posts (two P-5, four P-4,
four P-3 and two General Service (Other level)) to establish regional investigation
capacity in Nairobi and Vienna to cover peacekeeping missions in Africa and South-
East Asia, and in Europe and the Middle East, respectively; three posts (one P-5,



13

A/57/776

one P-4 and one P-3) in the Monitoring, Evaluation and Consulting Division to
enable oversight functions with regard to military aspects of peacekeeping
operations; and three posts (one P-3 and two General Service (Other level)) for the
Executive Office to manage the human and financial resources funded from the
support account.

60. The Advisory Committee welcomes the specific and concise content of the
results-based framework for this Office and the use of target benchmarks.
Future performance report information should therefore concentrate on the
extent to which units and the Office as a whole have attained their respective
expected accomplishments.

61. The 27 resident auditor posts to be consolidated under the support account are
shown and described in paragraphs 58 and 59 of A/57/732. The Advisory
Committee notes that the proposed consolidation is in line with the views expressed
by the Committee regarding the need for the Office of Internal Oversight Services to
have better control of the recruitment, administration, supervision and evaluation of
the performance of the resident auditors with a view to optimizing the use of this
service in field missions. In this connection, the Committee reiterates the comments
it made in paragraphs 48 to 52 of A/56/887.

62. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the proposal to
transfer the 27 resident auditor posts for consolidation and funding under the
support account for 2003/04. This recommendation, however, is made on the
understanding that whenever a mission’s mandate is terminated, the number of
audit posts should be adjusted accordingly.

63. As to the audit capacity proposed to be established at the United Nations
Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM), for which four new posts are
requested, the Advisory Committee is of the opinion, in view of current
circumstances, that the request should be suspended for the time being. In the
meantime, audit services should continue to be covered as hitherto.

64. As indicated in paragraph 59 above, it is proposed that 12 posts be established
for a regional investigation capacity in Nairobi and Vienna to cover peacekeeping
missions. The details for this proposal are included in A/57/494, and the related
comments of the Advisory Committee are contained in its general report on
peacekeeping operations. The Committee has previously stated that “investigation is
by nature a reactive function and that the structure for this function need not be a
mirror image of the function of resident auditors” (A/56/887, para. 55). Moreover,
UNMIK and UNMISET, which have accounted for a large number of investigations
in recent years and have resident investigators on board, are implementing plans for
downsizing.

65. From the additional information provided, the Advisory Committee believes
that there is a need for the Office of Internal Oversight Services to continue to refine
its methods of workload assessment, including the criteria used to determine cases
to investigate. The Committee is also of the view that the data included in the
workload assessment, for which investigation resources are requested, should
exclude cases that have been reported but referred to management for appropriate
action.

66. The Advisory Committee has already agreed with the regional investigation
approach (see A/56/887, para. 54). The Committee also recalls that the



14

A/57/776

Investigations Division currently has 27 posts (18 in New York and 3 each in
Geneva, Nairobi and the Tribunals). Under the circumstances, the Committee is not
convinced at this stage of the need for all 12 investigation posts. The Committee
recommends approval of four posts (three P-3 and one General Service) for the
Nairobi hub. The Committee expects, however, that they will also be used for
investigation work elsewhere, as appropriate.

67. The Advisory Committee discussed with the Under-Secretary-General for
Internal Oversight Services the request for the three posts to enable oversight
functions with regard to military aspects of peacekeeping (see paras. 50 and 51
above). The Committee enquired about the possibility of recruiting these individuals
on an “as and when required” basis. The Under-Secretary-General informed the
Committee that this would not be appropriate, since it was essential to have them as
staff members reporting and accountable to him at all times. Such an arrangement
would also ensure their knowledge and familiarity with the unique character of the
Organization.

68. However, the Advisory Committee was not persuaded by the argument to
establish the three additional posts for the availability of full-time military expertise.
The Committee recommends, should the services be required, that the same
approach used by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations be followed,
whereby expertise is obtained on an “as and when required” basis. The
Committee was informed that from time to time the Office of Internal Oversight
Services uses outside expertise for specific aspects of an investigation.

69. In view of the need to manage the human and financial resources funded
through the support account, the Committee recommends approval of two
posts (one P-3 and one General Service) out of the three proposed for the
Executive Office (see A/57/732, para. 63).

70. Consultancy resources of $158,700 are proposed for 2003/04, as indicated in
A/57/732, section II.C (c). The Advisory Committee is not convinced of the need for
the provision of specialized expertise in designing evaluation and inspection
exercises, since it is related to the three military experts mentioned in paragraph 67
above. The Committee does not recommend approval of the $28,000 requested for
this purpose. The resources for consultants should therefore be reduced by
$28,000, but increased by an amount covering six months of consultancy
services for each of the three experts; any additional requirements should be
reported in the performance report.

71. In view of the recommendation in paragraph 66 above for approval of 4
out of the 12 posts proposed for the regional investigators, the Advisory
Committee recommends that the amount of $456,000 in A/57/732, paragraph
68, related to official travel of the regional investigators, be adjusted downward
to $137,000. The resources for official travel would consequently be reduced
from $841,500 to $522,500. The resources proposed for information technology,
communications and facilities and infrastructure should also be adjusted
downward, to $65,600, $31,400 and $33,000, respectively. The estimate for
consultants should be increased to $329,300, taking into account the
recommendation made in paragraph 68 above. The Committee recommends
approval of the other non-staff costs (miscellaneous supplies and equipment) as
proposed. The net reduction for non-staff costs for the Office of Internal
Oversight Services would therefore be $360,000.



15

A/57/776

Office of Legal Affairs

72. The resources proposed for the Office of Legal Affairs for 2003/04 represent
an increase of $81,900, or 10.5 per cent, over the resources of $777,700 approved
for 2002/03. This is due mostly to the changes in salary costs and an increase in
travel, as explained in paragraphs 79 and 80 of A/57/732.

73. The Advisory Committee notes the provision for $17,000 for information
technology. As indicated in paragraph 83 of A/57/732, this amount includes $9,000
for maintenance of equipment and $8,000 for the replacement of five desktop
computers ($1,600 each). The Committee recalls, however, that in paragraph 69 of
A/56/885, the Office had requested $12,000 in order to replace five laptop
computers ($2,400 each) for 2002/03. The Committee sees no basis for the laptop
replacement at present. The Committee recommends that the provision for
information technology be reduced by $8,000.

74. The Advisory Committee did not receive adequate explanation for the
additional requirements of $17,000 for official travel. The resources for travel
should therefore be reduced by that amount, to a total of $13,000. The
Committee also recommends against approval of the resources proposed for
facilities and infrastructure ($1,000).

Department of Public Information

75. The proposed resource requirements for the support account related to the
Department of Public Information are $387,000, an increase of $85,500 (28.4 per
cent) over those approved for 2002/03. The 6.5 per cent increase for staff costs (see
A/57/732, sect. II.E (c)) relates to the changes in salary costs for two continuing
support account posts.

76. The Committee notes, however, that the Department is requesting resources for
official travel, facilities and infrastructure, communications and information
technology (ibid.) not previously included under the support account. No reasons are
given for this change. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the two
posts funded from the support account had been filled as at July 2002 and that
resources for non-staff costs had previously been included under the regular budget.

77. The Advisory Committee is not convinced by the reasons provided for two
staff from Headquarters to visit missions in order to provide support “in formulating
and implementing information strategies and promotional campaigns” (A/57/732,
para. 87). The Committee notes that included in the missions to be visited are a
number of missions to be downsized. Under the circumstances, the Committee
recommends that the resources for official travel be reduced by $35,000.

78. The Committee also recommends against approval of the resources
proposed for information technology ($12,600) and for facilities and
infrastructure ($400) in paragraphs 89 and 91 of A/57/732.



16

A/57/776

Department of Management

Office of the Under-Secretary-General

79. Except for the indicators of achievement and outputs for expected
accomplishment 1 for the Office of the Under-Secretary-General, which are
somewhat vague, the Committee found the content of the results-based framework
for a number of units in the Department of Management to be drafted in a way that
facilitates monitoring and reporting on performance. The outputs and indicators of
achievement for the Department of Management contain several that are measurable,
in contrast with the vagueness in the cases of other departmental units in the budget
report for the support account. The Committee expects the performance report
prepared for the Department of Management units to be equally specific in
indicating the extent to which the outputs and indicators of achievement have been
realized during implementation.

80. The omission of expected accomplishment 2 (see para. 11 (b) of A/57/732)
from the results-based framework for the Department of Management is due to the
fact that it is considered to relate largely to capacity-building in new peacekeeping
missions, which applies less to the Department of Management than to the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

81. The financial resources proposed for this Office, which includes the Office of
the Under-Secretary-General, the Contributions Service and the Treasury, amounting
to $1,485,500, reflect an increase of $431,200 (40.9 per cent) over the
apportionment for 2002/03. Most of the increase, as seen in A/57/732, section
II.F.1 (c), is due to increased requirements for posts ($311,200), including four new
posts (one P-4 post for a legal adviser and one General Service post in the Office of
the Under-Secretary-General, and one P-4 post for a database manager and one P-3
post for an investment accountant in the Treasury).

82. The current staffing table of the Office includes nine support account posts
(four Professional and five General Service). The functions of the proposed legal
adviser and assistant are indicated in paragraph 94 of the report. The Advisory
Committee was informed that the Department of Management receives
approximately 120 recommendations a year from the Joint Appeals Board and about
28 from the Joint Disciplinary Committee. The statutory requirement is to respond
within 30 days of the date of receiving a recommendation. Delays in responding
lead to awards of financial compensation by the United Nations Administrative
Tribunal. In this connection, the Committee recalls its observations, made in its
report on the administration of justice, on measures to address these delays in the
context of the management review to be conducted by the Office of Internal
Oversight Services (see A/57/736, paras. 6 and 7).

83. The request for a P-4 post represents a good example of how the need for
additional resources could be linked specifically to a measurable indicator of
achievement in furtherance of the expected accomplishment of expediting replies so
as to ensure compliance with the 30-day limit. Although this has not been done in
the current budget report, in view of the need to strengthen the capacity of the
Office of the Under-Secretary-General in this regard, the Advisory Committee
agrees with the establishment of the posts for the P-4 legal adviser and the
assistant at the General Service level, as requested in paragraph 94 of the
budget report. The Committee expects that the performance report will



17

A/57/776

indicate with precision the impact of the additional resources on the attainment
of stated objectives.

84. However, the Advisory Committee was not convinced by the information
provided in paragraphs 96 and 97 regarding the posts for a database manager and an
investment accountant. The Committee is of the opinion that the extensive
automation of the treasury and investment processes should lead to a reduction in
the need for additional staff. While the Committee does not recommend
establishing the P-4 and the P-3 post in the Treasury, it does recommend
approval of an equivalent amount of general temporary assistance for 2003/04
to address pressing needs. This issue can be revisited in the context of the
submission for 2004/05.

85. The Advisory Committee notes the provision for miscellaneous supplies,
services and equipment of $130,000. As indicated in paragraph 101 of A/57/732, it
comprises bank fees for peacekeeping-related operations ($120,000) and training
requirements ($10,000). Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that these bank
fees relate to wire transfers attributable to payroll payments processed by
Headquarters, currently absorbed by the regular budget. The Treasury is therefore
proposing to consolidate them under the support account budget. The Committee
recommends acceptance of the proposal.

86. The Advisory Committee also noted, under expected accomplishment 3 of the
Office of the Under-Secretary-General, the indicator of achievement “20 per cent
reduction in wire transfer fees at UNAMSIL, MONUC, MINURSO, UNMIK,
UNIFIL, UNFICYP”. The Committee was informed that the reduction in transfer
fees is to be achieved through the implementation of a special software program
(Insight) during 2003/04. The savings for these six missions are estimated at a total
of $346,880 (a cost of $7 per wire transfer using the software versus $20 using
paper-based instructions). Further savings will be available as other missions
implement the software. The Committee welcomes this development.

87. The Advisory Committee has made several comments and observations in its
general report on peacekeeping operations regarding the excessive fees paid by the
Organization for bank charges. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the
Secretariat would develop a model banking agreement to standardize peacekeeping
mission practices, with a view to negotiating lower bank charges with banking
authorities where the United Nations operates a peacekeeping mission. The
Committee welcomes this development and requests that, once the model
banking agreement has been developed, the lessons learned from its use be
applied in all offices and missions away from Headquarters, whether they are
peacekeeping missions or not.

88. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the other non-post resources
proposed for the Office of the Under-Secretary-General, indicated in
paragraph 99 ($60,000 for general temporary assistance) and paragraph 100
($30,000 for official travel) of A/57/732.

Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts

89. The resources proposed for the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and
Accounts, as shown in A/57/732, section II.F.2 (c), amount to $7,781,700, reflecting
an increase of $758,400, or 10.8 per cent, over those approved for 2002/03. The



18

A/57/776

increase is due mostly to additional requirements for posts, in view of the changes in
salary costs and a reclassification of one post to the P-4 level, as well as general
temporary assistance, official travel and miscellaneous supplies, services and
equipment. The staffing component remains at 58 posts (31 Professional and 27
General Service). The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the
proposal to reclassify the P-3 post of Chief of the Africa Unit in the Accounts
Division to the P-4 level.

90. The Advisory Committee was informed that while an internal management
review had been undertaken in the Accounts Division, there has not been an external
review. The Committee recommends that an external management review of the
Accounts Division be undertaken, including the deployment of staff in the light
of the use of information technology for this function.

91. A provision for $310,000 is proposed under general temporary assistance,
reflecting an increase of $160,000 over the resources of $150,000 approved for
2002/03, in order to improve the service levels in the Peacekeeping Accounts
Section and prevent the creation of backlogs (see A/57/732, para. 107). The
Advisory Committee recommends a reduction by $60,000 of the amount
proposed for general temporary assistance.

92. The resources proposed for official travel and miscellaneous supplies, services
and equipment amount to $555,000, reflecting an increase of $290,000, or 52 per
cent, over the resources approved for 2002/03. The Advisory Committee notes from
paragraphs 109 and 110 that the additional resources relate to training activities to
improve the implementation of objective-setting in peacekeeping budgets (two
workshops at a total cost of $380,000) and training in budgeting methodology and
information technology for the Peacekeeping Financing Division and the Accounts
Division. In view of the comments in paragraph 25 above regarding
information technology and  travel for management purposes, and taking into
account the considerable training that has already taken place concerning
budget methodology, the Committee recommends that the amount proposed for
these two budget items be reduced to a total of $500,000 (a reduction of
$55,000).

Office of Human Resources Management

93. The financial requirements for the Office of Human Resources Management,
as shown in A/57/732, section II.F.3 (c), are estimated at $3,311,100, reflecting an
increase of $172,100, or 5.5 per cent, over the appropriation for 2002/03. The
increase is due mostly to changes in salary costs and additional requirements
resulting from the proposal to establish three new posts: one P-3 post for a
psychologist and one General Service post for a secretary in the Medical Services
Division, and one P-3 post for a staff counsellor in the Specialist Services Division
(an increase of $254,100, or 10.9 per cent, over the post-related resources of
$2,329,900 for 2002/03). A description of the functions of these new posts is set out
in paragraphs 115 to 121 of the report.

94. The Advisory Committee agrees with the proposal to establish the post for
a psychologist at the P-3 level in the Medical Services Division, in order to
assist medical officers at Headquarters in assessing the mental-health status of
individuals returning from mission assignments. The Committee is not



19

A/57/776

convinced of the need for the proposed post for a secretary at the General
Service level.

95. As to the proposed post for a staff counsellor at the P-3 level, the Advisory
Committee exchanged views with representatives of the Medical Services Division
and the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator. The Committee notes
that the Office of the Security Coordinator has resource capacity (at the P-4 level)
related to critical-incident stress counselling. Services provided include referral to
specialists for further counselling. The Committee also notes the explanation as to
the different functions performed by the Office of the Security Coordinator,
Department of Peacekeeping Operations staff welfare officers within missions, and
the proposed Office of Human Resources Management staff counsellor. However,
the Committee is not convinced by the argument that continuity of service to staff
rotating between peacekeeping assignments and Headquarters entails the necessity
to establish new posts, unless it can be demonstrated that staff services currently
available are inadequate.

96. On the basis of this information, the Advisory Committee concluded that the
present cooperation and collaboration between the Office of the Security
Coordinator and the Office of Human Resources Management should be enhanced
and the services of both Offices used to maximum effectiveness before a request is
made for another counsellor in the Office of Human Resources Management.
Accordingly, the Committee does not recommend approval of the request for a
P-3 post for a staff counsellor.

97. The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the non-staff costs
proposed for the Office of Human Resources Management. However, the
Committee expects savings under general temporary assistance, given its
recommendation in respect of requested posts.

Office of Central Support Services

98. The financial resources proposed for the Office of Central Support Services for
2003/04 are estimated at $5,622,400, reflecting an increase of $901,500, or 19.1 per
cent, over the resources approved for 2002/03. The increase of $224,500, or 4.8 per
cent, for staff costs reflects the changes in salary costs for a staffing component of
44 continuing posts and the reclassification of the post of Chief of the Logistics and
Transportation Section from the P-4 to the P-5 level. Increases in non-post resources
include additional requirements for official travel and for miscellaneous supplies,
services and equipment. The Advisory Committee recommends against the
proposed reclassification.

99. The Advisory Committee notes that 36 posts (21 Professional and 15 General
Service) financed from the support account provide backstopping for procurement-
related functions at Headquarters. Out of the 36 posts, 29 (1 P-5, 8 P-4, 8 P-3 and 12
General Service) are in the Procurement Division, involved in field procurement. It
appears that the core functions could be performed more effectively and efficiently
at the Logistics Base at Brindisi, which interacts with all field missions for various
forms of logistics support. Besides, the field missions’ annual procurement plans
and ad hoc emergency requests could be better analysed, taking into account the
availability of functional existing stocks. The Committee requests a
comprehensive examination of the merits of establishing a global procurement

hub for all peacekeeping missions at the Logistics Base at Brindisi, transferring
both post and non-post resources financed from the support account at
Headquarters and retaining only a few posts in New York for policy and liaison
functions.

100. Section II.F.4 (c) of A/57/732 shows requirements of $250,000 for official
travel, reflecting an increase of $205,000 over the resources approved for 2002/03,
resulting mostly from the implementation of a field training programme and
management review visits by the Procurement Division (see A/57/732, para. 133).
Resources for miscellaneous supplies, services and equipment, estimated at
$484,000, reflect an increase of $464,000 over the apportionment for 2002/03, as a
result of the provision for the development of the training programme in the
Procurement Division.

101. In view of the comments of the Board of Auditors on the issue of
procurement training,1 the Advisory Committee welcomes the emphasis on
training for procurement activities and the central role the Procurement
Division plays in setting guidelines for field missions in this regard. The
Committee welcomes the management reviews planned for several missions (see
A/57/732, para. 133). The Committee trusts that the findings will be applied
also to those missions for which reviews were not conducted.

102. The additional requirements of $464,000 for miscellaneous supplies, services
and equipment are explained in paragraphs 137 to 139 of A/57/732. The Advisory
Committee was further informed that this initiative is part of an inter-agency
programme for which the Turin Training Centre of the International Labour
Organization would act as project leader. The Committee notes from paragraph 138
of A/57/732 that it is estimated that by the end of the project about 200 procurement
staff will have completed the training requirements for certification, creating the
potential and incentive for certifying 90 per cent of all procurement personnel
system-wide by 2006. In addition, the Committee was informed that once the project
was completed the number of persons required to be trained in procurement in
peacekeeping missions would decrease.

103. The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the proposal for non-
staff resources for the Office of Central Support Services.

Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator

104. Financial resource requirements for the Office of the United Nations Security
Coordinator are estimated at $1,180,500, reflecting an increase of $85,900, or 7.9
per cent, over the resources approved for 2002/03. Most of the increase is the result
of additional resources ($93,000) for official travel over the $75,000 appropriated
for 2002/03.

105. The resources proposed are broken down in section II.G (c) of A/57/732. The
Advisory Committee notes, as indicated in paragraph 148 of that document, that the
increase during the 2003/04 period is due to the conduct of training workshops in
five peacekeeping missions (the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, the
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNIKOM, the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus).

106. The Advisory Committee also notes the information provided by the Secretary-
General on the utilization of the strengthened capacity of the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator for enhancing the safety and security of United
Nations and associated personnel (see A/57/711, paras. 68-77). With regard to
recruitment for the four additional posts approved under the support account in
December 2001 (ibid., para. 68), the Committee was informed that all had been
filled as at March 2003. The Committee also enquired about the consultations to
delineate the lines of responsibility between the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations and the Security Coordinator. The Committee was
informed that these were still ongoing and that the process would end with the
evaluation of the United Nations security system to be conducted by mid-2003, the
report on which the General Assembly requested to have submitted to it at its fifty-
eighth session (see resolution 56/255, sect. VIII, para. 4). The Committee
reiterates the need for a well-defined hierarchical security structure in the field
and the need to expeditiously define clear lines of responsibility and
accountability in ensuring the safety and security of staff (see A/56/619).

107. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the resources proposed
for the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator.

V. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee

108. The action proposed to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with
the support account is indicated in paragraph 15 of the performance report for the
period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (A/57/725). The Advisory Committee
recommends approval of the action proposed by the Secretary-General therein.

109. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of the support account for the 12-month period from 1 July 2003 to 30
June 2004 is set out in paragraph 152 of the budget report (A/57/732).

110. In the present document, the Advisory Committee has made
recommendations for reductions that would total $4,371,300 gross ($4,090,800
net). Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the General Assembly
approve total staffing and non-staffing requirements of $111,491,800 gross
($96,227,700 net) for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. The
Committee also recommends that the miscellaneous income of $3,126,000 for
the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 be applied to the resources
required for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 and that the balance
of $108,365,800 gross ($93,101,700 net) be prorated among the individual
peacekeeping operation budgets to meet the requirements of the support
account for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004.
