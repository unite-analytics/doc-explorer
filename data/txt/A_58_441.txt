Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the note by the Secretary-General providing updated information on the
status of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (A/58/386). During
its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the
Secretary-General who provided additional information.

2. As indicated in the note, the proposed budget for UNIKOM for the period from
1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (A/57/664 and Corr.1) was submitted to the General
Assembly in anticipation of the continuation of the Mission (see A/58/386, para. 1).

3. In his letter dated 3 April 2003 (S/2003/400) addressed to the Secretary-
General, the President of the Security Council informed the Secretary-General that
the members of the Council had noted that UNIKOM was unable to fulfil its
mandate as a result of the situation on the ground, and concurred with the
recommendation of the Secretary-General that a peacekeeping presence be retained
at an appropriate level for a further three months, until 6 July 2003, subject to any
further decision the Council might take regarding the UNIKOM mandate.

4. The Secretary-General, in his note dated 14 May 2003 (A/57/811), proposed
interim financing arrangements for UNIKOM for the four-month period from 1 July
to 31 October 2003. The Secretary-General also indicated that, subject to the
decision by the Security Council, a revised budget proposal for the period from
1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 would be submitted to the General Assembly during its
fifty-eighth session (see A/58/386, para. 3).

5. By its resolution 57/330 of 18 June 2003, upon the recommendation of the
Advisory Committee, the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to
enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $12 million for the period from

A/58/441

1 July to 31 October 2003, to be financed from the accumulated fund balance in the
Special Account for UNIKOM.

6. By its resolution 1490 (2003) of 3 July 2003, the Security Council decided to
continue the mandate of UNIKOM for a final period until 6 October 2003.

7. The Advisory Committee notes that in view of the closure of the Mission, no
revised budget will be submitted to the General Assembly for the period from 1 July
2003 to 30 June 2004 (see A/58/386, para. 7). The Committee also notes that the
$12 million commitment authority approved by the General Assembly would suffice
to cover the remaining activities of the mission, including its liquidation.

8. The Advisory Committee was informed that in accordance with the liquidation
plan, the assets of the Mission have already been categorized into the standard
groups and that a complete report on the disposition of these assets would be
presented to the General Assembly during the spring of 2005, in the context of the
performance report on UNIKOM.

9. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly take
note of the information that no revised budget will be submitted to the
Assembly for UNIKOM for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004.
