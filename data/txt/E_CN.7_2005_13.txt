  Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions 
 
 

 I. Introduction 
 
 

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has 
considered, in advance form, the report of the Executive Director on the 
consolidated budget for the biennium 2006-2007 for the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (E/CN.7/2005/12 and Add.1). The report presents 
separate budgets for the UNODC drug and crime programmes, including a 
presentation of planned activities and resources required for their implementation. 
The Advisory Committee met with the Executive Director and, via videoconference, 
with other senior officials of UNODC. 

2. UNODC implements the drug and crime programmes in an integrated manner. 
These comprise the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, 
established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 45/179 of 21 December 1990, 
and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, 
established by the Assembly in its resolution 46/152 of 18 December 1991. In 
paragraph 2 of its report on the consolidated budget of UNODC for the biennium 
2004-2005 (E/CN.7/2003/21), the Advisory Committee requested that, in future, it 
should be provided with an organizational chart that included the number of posts in 
each unit at UNODC headquarters. The Committee regrets that the requested 
organizational chart was not included with the budget proposal and was provided 
only after enquiry. The Committee expects that the organizational chart will be 
included as a matter of routine with future UNODC budget proposals.

 II. Budget format and presentation 
 
 

3. The consolidated budget of UNODC includes normative, technical cooperation 
and core programme activities and a support budget necessary to enable the Office 
to implement the programme. The programme budget is funded mainly from 
special-purpose funds (earmarked voluntary funds) and the support budget from 
general-purpose voluntary contributions. Special-purpose funds are earmarked by 
region or by theme (“soft” earmarking) or are earmarked to a specific project or 
activity within a project (“hard” earmarking). General-purpose funds also finance 
priority areas not attracting special-purpose (earmarked) contributions, thus 
providing programme flexibility. For the biennium 2006-2007, under a low-income 
projection for UNODC (base-income scenario), special-purpose funds would 
account for 73 per cent of the income projection for the Office, while 
general-purpose funds would account for 14 per cent and the contribution from the 
regular budget of the United Nations would account for 13 per cent (see 
E/CN.7/2005/12, figure I). 

4. The Advisory Committee points out that, since its recommendation in the 
year 2003, there has not been much progress with respect to result-based budgeting. 
The absence of clearly defined objectives, benchmarks and quantifiable outputs 
makes it difficult to determine whether UNODC operations are efficient, effective 
and economical. The Advisory Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation that 
the Office maintain better coordination with the Budget Division of the Secretariat 
to ensure compliance with result-based budgeting modalities, as well as to ensure 
harmonization of budget terminology. 

5.  The Advisory Committee notes that financial tables for the biennium 
2004-2005 and the biennium 2006-2007 were compiled separately by theme and not 
in a comprehensive manner, making the document somewhat disjointed. Although 
comparative tables were provided following specific enquiry, the initial absence of 
financial information by budget line item made it difficult to make an overall 
judgement of the Office’s administrative and budgetary resources prior to meeting 
with UNODC officials. It would have been helpful if consolidated tables had been 
included, explaining reasons behind changes in projected expenditures. For 
example, additional information provided to the Committee indicated that, on the 
final budget for the biennium 2004-2005, for the amount allocated for furniture and 
equipment (Africa and the Near and Middle East) was $92,200, with an initial 
estimate for the biennium 2006-2007 of $139,600; however, no explanation for the 
increase was provided. Another example relates to general temporary assistance for 
headquarters support under management and administration. The final budget for 
the biennium 2004-2005 amounted to $38,100, whereas the budget estimate for the 
biennium 2006-2007 amounts to $338,100, constituting, without explanation, an 
increase of 887 per cent. Other examples are noted in almost all major objects of 
expenditure, including travel and security. The Committee expects that the UNODC 
administration, in collaboration with the Budget Division of the Secretariat, will, in 
future, include relevant financial information and a full explanation and presentation 
of increases and decreases for all objects of expenditure as a matter of routine.

 III. Consolidated income projections 
 
 

6.  Figure I in the report of the Executive Director (E/CN.7/2005/12) shows total 
voluntary income projections for UNODC for the biennium 2006-2007, as compared 
with the biennium 2004-2005. For the biennium 2006-2007, a base- and a 
high-income scenario are presented for both the drug programme and the crime 
programme. The proposed budget for the biennium 2006-2007 is predicted on a 
projected total income from voluntary sources of $206.4 million (base-income 
scenario), comprising $154.9 million for the drug programme and $51.5 million for 
the crime programme. The total income projections for the biennium 2006-2007 
from voluntary sources of $206.4 million show an increase of about 3 per cent 
compared with the income for the biennium 2004-2005 of $199.8 million.  

7.  The Advisory Committee notes from figure I that general-purpose funds for 
the drug and crime programmes are expected to decrease to $33.3 million for the 
biennium 2006-2007 ($28.6 million for the drug programme and $4.7 million for the 
crime programme), compared with $37.7 million for the biennium 2004-2005 
($33.6 million for the drug programme and $4.1 million for the crime programme).  

8.  The consolidated budget (E/CN.7/2005/12, para. 8) indicates that total income 
has grown by $41.6 million (22 per cent), from $190.4 million in the biennium 
2002-2003 to $232 million in the biennium 2004-2005, and is projected to increase 
by $6.6 million (3 per cent) in the biennium 2006-2007. Furthermore, most of the 
income growth is in voluntary contributions to the crime programme, which 
increased by $23.9 million (162 per cent), from $14.7 million in the biennium 
2002-2003 to $38.6 million in the biennium 2004-2005, and is expected to increase 
by another $13 million (34 per cent) in the biennium 2006-2007. The consolidated 
budget further explains that the share of special-purpose (earmarked) voluntary 
income is on the increase, rising from 68 per cent of total income in the biennium 
2002-2003 to a projected 73 per cent in the biennium 2006-2007. 

9. The expenditure ratio between programmes (substantive work) and 
infrastructure (support activities) is improving, rising from 76:24 in the biennium 
2002-2003 to 77:23 in the biennium 2004-2005 to a projected 79:21 ratio in the 
biennium 2006-2007. The Committee trusts that this trend will continue and 
anticipates a further improved ratio in the result-based budgetary performance 
report for the biennium 2006-2007. 

10. According to UNODC, in order to maintain the Office’s infrastructure, a 
predictable level of assured core funds are required, both from the regular budget of 
the United Nations and from unearmarked, voluntary sources (core funds) 
(E/CN.7/2005/12, para 12); the availability of such core funds therefore ensures 
payments for ongoing commitments, including the payment of staff contracts. The 
Committee notes that the core fund balance for the drug programme is currently 
insufficient (under $8 million) to cover the annual core fund expenditure of 
$15 million per annum and that most core fund income would be received in the 
second half of each year on a voluntary basis. The Committee trusts that the Office 
will redouble its fund-raising efforts to ensure that the required core fund balance of 
$15 million is met.

 IV. Other resource-related matters 
 
 

11.  UNODC’s monitoring and evaluation function is financed from extrabudgetary 
resources. The Advisory Committee recalls paragraph 16.12 of the proposed 
programme budget (A/60/6 (Sect. 16)), in which resources for the conduct of 
monitoring and evaluation for this section are estimated to amount to $1,570,400 
from extrabudgetary resources (reflected under subprogramme 1).  

12.  Upon enquiry, UNODC informed the Advisory Committee that the 
Independent Evaluation Unit, with three Professional staff and two General Service 
staff in the Policy Analysis and Research Branch (Division for Policy Analysis and 
Public Affairs), was responsible for planning and coordinating the evaluation 
activities for UNODC. UNODC also informed the Advisory Committee that, once 
an evaluation was completed, it was distributed to member States and senior 
management for action. An implementation plan was prepared jointly by the 
Independent Evaluation Unit and the substantive office and then submitted to the 
UNODC Executive Committee; an agreement was then reached between the 
Committee and the substantive office on implementable recommendations. The 
substantive office reported to the Independent Evaluation Unit every six months on 
progress made. The Advisory Committee believes that monitoring and evaluation 
are intrinsic functions of entities of the United Nations system and trusts that 
UNODC will continue to be proactive in ensuring that this important function will 
retain its steady funding. 
 
 

 V. Information technology 
 
 

13.  The Advisory Committee recalls that, in its report on the consolidated budget 
of UNODC for the biennium 2004-2005 (E/CN.7/2003/21, para. 17), it did not 
support the proposed mode of funding phase 2 of the Programme and Financial 
Management Information System (ProFi). Specifically, the Committee 
recommended that the full cost of ProFi be funded from the support budget and not 
from project allocations. As noted in the consolidated budget for the biennium 
2006-2007 (E/CN.7/2005/12/Add.1, annex IV, sect. II, “Infrastructure 2004-2005”, 
para. 15), the Commission agreed with the Advisory Committee’s recommendation. 
The Committee notes that the requirements for the maintenance of ProFi are now 
fully budgeted under infrastructure. As indicated in table 42 of the initial budget 
(E/CN.7/2003/20), the human resource requirements for ProFi, that is, the ProFi 
Coordinator (P-3 level), System Administrator (General Service (Principal level)) 
and two General Service (Other level) staff, are reflected accordingly in the staffing 
table. 
 
 

 VI. Management-related matters 
 
 

14.  The Advisory Committee was informed that the Executive Director’s overall 
decision-making process would benefit from access to a formal or informal 
intergovernmental consultative body. Such a consultative body would be 
particularly valuable in view of the dual management functions of the Executive 
Director of UNODC, namely management of both the drug programme and the

 E/CN.7/2005/13

crime programme. The Advisory Committee believes that a non-binding 
consultative body, without the intention to micromanage, would be valuable in 
sharing the burden of decision-making and could provide confidential professional 
opinions and perspectives on matters under consideration by the Executive Director. 
The Advisory Committee recommends that further thought should be given to the 
membership and terms of reference of such a consultative body. 

15. The Advisory Committee notes that UNODC implements drug and crime 
programmes in an integrated manner for the United Nations International Drug 
Control Programme and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 
Programme. The Committee points out that, while the budget proposal and all other 
matters are managed in an integrated manner, the two programmes are governed by 
separate and distinct governing bodies. In order to provide a more cohesive 
decision-making process and better integrate the management of the two 
programmes, the Advisory Committee recommends that thought be given to 
merging the two separate governing bodies into one.
