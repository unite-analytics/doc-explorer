Financing of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions*

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the
Secretary-General on the financial performance of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO) for the period from 1 July 2000 to
30 June 2001 (A/56/818) and on the proposed budget
for the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July
2002 to 30 June 2003 (A/56/826). During its
consideration of the reports, the Committee met with
representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided
additional information.

2. By its resolution 690 (1991) of 29 April 1991, the
Security Council established MINURSO for an initial
period of six months. Since then, its mandate has been
extended by the Council in various resolutions, the
latest of which was resolution 1406 (2002) of 30 April
2002, by which the Council extended the mandate of
the Mission until 31 July 2002 in order to consider
further the report of the Secretary-General of 19
February 2002 (S/2002/178).

3. The Advisory Committee points out that, in his
report of 19 February, the Secretary-General presented
four options for consideration before the Council
(S/2002/178, paras. 48-51), any one of which, if
approved by the Council, may, in the view of the
Committee, impact significantly on resource
requirements for the Mission during the financial
period 2002/2003. The Committee notes that the
proposed budget for MINURSO (A/56/826) is based on
the Mission’s maintenance requirements and reflects
resource reduction associated with the suspension of
the activities of the Identification Commission. The
Advisory Committee considered the proposed
budget of MINURSO on the understanding that,
should modifications be made pursuant to decisions
of the Security Council, the Secretary-General
would report to the General Assembly no later than
September 2002.

Financial performance report for
the period from 1 July 2000 to
30 June 2001

4. The General Assembly, by its resolution 54/268
of 15 June 2000, appropriated an amount of
$49,317,037 gross ($45,078,102 net) for the

* The performance report and proposed budget for
MINURSO were considered by the Advisory Committee
on 15 May 2002. The Advisory Committee approved the
draft report on 17 May 2002 and sent it for processing on
that date.

maintenance of MINURSO for the period from 1 July
2000 to 30 June 2001, inclusive of the amount of
$2,339,659 for the support account and the amount of
$365,778 for the United Nations Logistics Base at
Brindisi, Italy. Expenditures for the period totalled
$45,989,300 gross ($42,215,900), resulting in an
unutilized balance of $3,327,737 gross ($2,862,202
net) or 7 per cent of the total appropriation. Full
reported expenditure amounted to $49,660,000,
including $3,670,000 in voluntary contributions.

5. The unutilized balance of $3,327,700 resulted
from reduced requirements under military personnel
($306,200), civilian personnel ($2,452,700),
operational requirements ($89,100), other programmes
($14,200) and staff assessment ($465,500).

6. The Advisory Committee notes that the largest
reduction in resource requirements falls under civilian
personnel. As indicated in the performance report
(A/56/818, annex II, paras. 6 and 7), the reduction is
mainly due to higher than budgeted vacancy rates for
civilian police and international staff. The Committee
was informed that the reason for the reduction in
resource requirements stems from the suspension of the
activities of the Identification Commission and its
support staff, inclusive of the Civilian Police, whose
duties are connected with that of the Identification
Commission.

7. In connection with operational requirements, the
Advisory Committee notes from the performance
report (ibid., paras. 14 and 15) that there was an
overexpenditure of $1,031,500 under air operations.
The Committee notes the lack of adequate
explanation for the overexpenditure and requests
that future performance reports for the Mission
contain detailed justifications for significant
variances in budget implementation.

8. The action to be taken by the General Assembly
in connection with the financing of MINURSO for the
period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 is indicated in
the performance report (A/56/818, para. 10). The
Advisory Committee recommends that the
unencumbered balance of $3,327,737 gross
($2,862,202 net) for the period from 1 July 2000 to
30 June 2001 be credited to Member States in a
manner to be decided by the General Assembly.

Information on performance for the
current period

9. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at
31 March 2002, the amount of $6.5 million had been
reimbursed for troop costs for the period from 1
September 1991 to 31 January 2002 and that the
amount owed for the period from 1 February 2002 to
30 April 2002 was $70,605.

10. With regard to reimbursement for contingent-
owned equipment, the Advisory Committee was
informed that the amount that had been reimbursed was
$5,097,712; the estimated amount owed as at 31 March
2002, was $5,185,694; and unliquidated obligations for
contingent-owned equipment amounted to $1,994,827.
As regards death and disability, as at 31 March 2002,
11 claims have been settled amounting to $315,384; the
balance of obligations amounts to $434,536 with one
claim remaining.

11. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at
1 April 2002, the cash position of MINURSO
amounted to $24.7 million. Assessment on Member
States amounted to $482.2 million, as at 31 March
2002, and payments received totalled $410.5 million.
Total unliquidated obligations for the period from
1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, as at 31 March 2002,
were $1.2 million, and current loans, as at 30 April
2002, were $11 million from the United Nations
Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and $5 million from the
United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda
(UNAMIR). The Committee was informed that there
were no claims under arbitration in respect of
MINURSO.

12. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
incumbency situation at MINURSO, as at 31 March
2002, was as follows:

Posts Authorized Encumbered

Military contingents 27 27

Military observers 203 192

Civilian police 81 25

International staff 300 174

Local staff 113 110

Organization of African Unity

Cost estimates for the period from
1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002

13. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-
General (A/56/826, para. 9), the proposed budget for
MINURSO for 2002/2003, which amounts to
$41,529,500 gross ($38,488,500 net), is based on the
Mission’s maintenance requirements. The proposed
budget represents a 15 per cent decrease ($7,320,100)
in gross terms in relation to the apportionment for the
current period ending 30 June 2002. Voluntary
contributions for the period are estimated at
$6,099,700. The proposed overall decrease reflects a
7.3 per cent decrease in military personnel costs, a 21.4
per cent decrease in civilian personnel costs, a 7.9 per
cent decrease in operational costs, a 13.7 per cent
decrease in staff assessment and a 71.8 per cent
increase under other programmes.

14. No changes are proposed to the personnel
composition of the Mission, compared to the current
financial period, which provides for 203 military
observers, 27 military contingents, 81 civilian police,
300 international staff, 113 local staff and 10
Organization of African Unity (OAU) observers. The
Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that
the table entitled “Current and proposed staffing” in
chapter VIII of the report erroneously indicated the
number of posts in the Professional category and above
at 109, instead of 110 and the grand total at 422,
instead of 423. The reason for the error was that the
post of the Assistant Secretary-General was
inadvertently omitted.

15. The Advisory Committee was also informed that,
although the estimates for international staff are based
on a zero vacancy factor, the cost of 116 posts out of
162 posts of the Identification Commission (excluding
10 OAU observers) was not included in the proposed
budget for MINURSO. The Committee notes from the
report (A/56/826, para. 18) that, should the activities of
the Identification Commission be resumed on a full-
scale basis, the Controller will revert to the General
Assembly to request the related additional resources. In
this connection, the Committee refers to its observation
in paragraph 3 above.

16. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
proposed budget takes into account reduction in
mission subsistence allowance (MSA) rates for
MINURSO from $60 to $50 per day. This resulted in a
reduction in MSA requirements of $766,400 for

military personnel and $3,181,500 for civilian
personnel in comparison with the apportionment for the
financial period 2001/2002.

17. The Advisory Committee observes from the
report (ibid., para. 19) that an attempt has been made to
adhere to General Assembly resolution 55/220 C of 14
June 2001, wherein the Secretary-General was
requested to ensure the use of objective-setting by the
administrations of peacekeeping missions. The
Advisory Committee is of the view that the
administration of MINURSO should refine its
approach to objective-setting requirements with a
view, in particular, to providing specific and
measurable indicators of achievement.

18. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly
in connection with the financing of MINURSO for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 are set out in
the proposed budget (ibid., para. 3). The Advisory
Committee recommends that the amount of
$41,529,500 gross ($38,488,500 net) be approved for
the maintenance of MINURSO for the 12-month
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 and that
the amount be assessed at a monthly rate of
$3,460,792 gross ($3,207,375 net) should the
Security Council decide to extend the mandate of
MINURSO beyond 31 July 2002.
