Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on gratis personnel provided by
Governments and other entities (A/57/721). During its consideration of the report,
the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided
additional information.

2. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in paragraph 12 of
its resolution 51/243 of 15 September 1997, requested the submission of annual
reports on the use of gratis personnel, indicating, inter alia, their nationality, the
duration of their service and the functions performed. The report of the Secretary-
General, which updates the information contained in the previous report on the
subject (A/56/839), covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2002.

3. The report indicates a total number of 301 type I gratis personnel (142 interns,
124 associate experts, 35 technical cooperation experts) as of 31 December 2002
(A/57/721, table 1).

4. The report also indicates the existence of one type II gratis personnel in service
as at 31 December 2002 (ibid., table 2). A total of three such personnel were
reported as at 31 December 2001 (A/56/839, table 2).

5. In view of the steps taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51/243
for the management of the employment of gratis personnel and the phasing out
of the number of such personnel since the adoption of the resolution, the
Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the Secretary-General should now be
requested to provide this type of information in the context of his report on the
composition of the Secretariat, submitted on a biennial basis. Furthermore, the
information contained in the report regarding type I gratis personnel
(A/57/721, table 1) should be expanded to include nationality, duration and
functions performed.
