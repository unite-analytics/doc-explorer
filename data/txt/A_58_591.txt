Financing of the United Nations Mission in Liberia

Proposed budget for the United Nations Mission in Liberia
for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed budget for the
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for the period from 1 August 2003 to
30 June 2004 (A/58/539). During its consideration of the report, the Committee met
with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information
and clarification.

2. The Security Council, by its resolution 1497 (2003) of 1 August 2003, declared
its readiness to establish a United Nations stabilization force in Liberia. By a letter
dated 4 September 2003, the Advisory Committee authorized commitments in the
amount of $47,462,700 gross ($46,892,500 net) to meet the cost of initial critical
logistical and personnel requirements of the operation in Liberia for the period from
1 August to 31 December 2003.

3. By its resolution 1509 (2003) of 19 September 2003, the Security Council
decided to establish UNMIL for a period of 12 months, consisting of 15,000 United
Nations military personnel, including up to 250 military observers and 160 staff
officers, and up to 1,115 civilian police officers. The cost estimates contained in the
proposed budget are based on the mandate of the Mission, as set out in resolution
1509 (2003), and on the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on
Liberia (S/2003/875).

4. The Advisory Committee takes note of table 1 of the proposed budget, in
which the time line leading up to the completion of the budget estimates of the
Mission is given. The Committee commends the Secretariat for the speed with
which it prepared the budget estimates for this large and complex mission, as
well as the quality of the presentation.

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that as from 1 October 2003, as
indicated in the report of the Secretary-General (S/2003/875, para. 114), the major
functions performed by the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in
Liberia, which had been funded under the regular budget as a special political
mission, had been transferred to UNMIL, together with the staff of the Office.

to 30 June 2004

A. General comments

6. The Advisory Committee welcomes the presentation of the budget
estimates using results-based budgeting techniques and encourages further
improvement, taking into account the views expressed by the Committee in its
previous reports on peacekeeping operations (see, for example, A/57/772, paras.
37-56). In this connection, while the Committee recognizes the difficulties
inherent in linking requests for resources to outputs and accomplishments, it
reiterates its view that such a linkage is an essential element of the results-
based budgeting concept (see para. 12 of the Committee’s first report on the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-20031 and A/57/772, para.
52) and requests the Secretariat to work towards that end.

7. The Advisory Committee notes, as indicated in the report of the Secretary-
General to the Security Council (S/2003/875, paras. 53 and 100), that the Mission is
to include a mechanism for coordinating its activities with those of the humanitarian
and development community and that it will also work closely with the United
Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), the United Nations Mission in Côte
d’Ivoire (MINUCI) and the United Nations Office for West Africa, as well as the
Economic Community of West African States and the African Union. The Special
Representative of the Secretary-General is to have overall authority for the activities
of the Mission and the United Nations system in Liberia (ibid., para. 53). The
Committee requests that an effective mechanism be established for the
discharge of this “overall authority”. The Committee further requests that
information in this regard be provided to it in the context of the next budget
estimates.

8. The Advisory Committee also requests that in future budget estimates, the
mechanisms for effective collaboration and coordination be more clearly
identified. For example, the Committee was provided with supplementary
information estimating requirements for the disarmament, demobilization,
reintegration and repatriation programme at $35,484,550. Upon enquiry, the
Committee was informed that it was actually a much larger programme involving
the whole United Nations system, and that the $35.5 million represented the amount
to be funded from the assessed peacekeeping budget (see also para. 21 below). The
Committee expects that, for its consideration of the next budget estimates, it
will be provided with full information on these and other requirements,
including support to be provided by specialized agencies and other United
Nations entities. Further, the Committee trusts that cooperation and
collaboration between the Mission and the relevant United Nations entities will
be pursued at all substantive levels (see also para. 16 below).

A/58/591

9. The Advisory Committee trusts that the mandated close cooperation
between UNMIL, UNAMSIL and MINUCI would lead to efficiencies that could
result in savings.

10. Under the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on 18 August
2003, elections are to be held in October 2005. Upon enquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that the time frame for the completion of the mandate of
UNMIL was expected to be within three years.

B. Resource requirements

11. Resource requirements for UNMIL for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30
June 2004 are estimated at $564,614,300, including budgeted voluntary
contributions in kind totalling $120,000. Of the estimated requirements, $9,688,300
represents expenditures incurred by UNMIL for the period from 1 August to 30
September 2003, and $554,926,000 covers estimated requirements for the period
from 1 October 2003 to 30 June 2004 (see A/58/539, sect. II.A). The budget
provides for the phased deployment of 14,785 military contingent personnel, 215
military observers, 1,115 civilian police officers, including 360 formed police
personnel, 607 international staff, 768 national staff and 286 United Nations
Volunteers.

1. Military and police personnel

12.  The estimate of $200,287,300 under military and police personnel is based on
a phased deployment schedule, which provides for full deployment of 14,785
military contingent personnel, 215 military observers and 1,115 civilian police
officers by 31 March 2004, and takes into account a delayed deployment rate of 35
per cent for all such personnel. In the experience of the Advisory Committee,
deployment schedules such as the one proposed for UNMIL often prove to be
overly optimistic. It is the understanding of the Committee that once troop-
contributing countries have been identified, a lack of complete readiness on the part
of those countries to deploy troops can often be a cause for delay. Delays can also be
attributed to slowness on the part of the United Nations in the provision of logistical
support.

13. The Advisory Committee was informed that the unit cost of rations for UNMIL
was $6.40 per day. The Committee enquired as to why the cost was higher for
UNMIL than for UNAMSIL, where it was budgeted at $5.75 per day, even though
the same contractor was being used for both missions. The Committee was informed
that UNMIL as yet had no contract for rations, and that they were being provided by
the UNAMSIL contractor until an international bidding process could be
undertaken. The Committee therefore expects that savings will be realized under
this item.

2. Civilian personnel

14. The estimated requirements for civilian personnel for the period from 1 August
2003 to 30 June 2004, which provide for a total of 1,661 staff (607 international
staff, 768 national staff and 286 United Nations Volunteers), amount to $51,655,300
(see ibid., sects. II.A and B). The Advisory Committee notes that requirements have
been adjusted by vacancy factors of 50 per cent for international staff and 30 per



4
A/58/591

cent in respect of national staff and United Nations Volunteers (ibid., paras. 134-
136). The Committee further notes that the New York standard salary scale was
applied to 70 per cent of proposed international staff. Staff costs for the remaining
30 per cent are based on salary scales for appointments of limited duration, with a
50 per cent reduction factored in with respect to common staff costs.

15. The Advisory Committee notes that the proposed organizational structure of
UNMIL, much like that proposed for the United Nations Organization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), consists of numerous small
sections and units with chiefs at the P-4 and P-5 levels, sometimes with very few
staff for them to supervise. The Committee reiterates its view that this tends to
inflate the grade structure and can lead to duplication of functions.

16. The Advisory Committee also notes a tendency in UNMIL to respond to
aspects of the Security Council mandate by either creating separate units within the
Mission to deal with them or translating the mandate into requests for staff and
consultancy resources. For example, in paragraph 3 (r) of its resolution 1509 (2003),
the Council decided that the mandate of the Mission should include assisting the
transitional government in restoring the proper administration of natural resources,
hence the requirement for two advisers on environment and natural resources (1 P-4
and 1 P-3) and two professional environment/resources officers (National Officers)
mentioned in paragraph 66 of the proposed budget. The Committee is of the view
that the Mission should draw upon the expertise of other concerned United
Nations entities and involve them in a coordinated approach to implementing
the mandate rather than automatically translating every aspect of the Security
Council mandate into requests for staff and consultancy resources.

17. The Advisory Committee requests the Secretary-General to review the
organizational structure of the Mission with a view to streamlining it, taking
into account the views of the Committee as expressed in the present report (see
also the report of the Committee on MONUC, where a similar situation exists
(A/58/447, paras. 30-37)). The results of that review should be reported in the
next budget submission for UNMIL.

18. The Advisory Committee stresses the importance of the functions to be
undertaken by the Legal and Judicial System Support Division, as outlined in
the proposed budget (see A/58/539, paras. 48-53) and in the report of the
Secretary-General to the Security Council (S/2003/875, paras. 71-74). The
Committee requests that a summary of the Mission’s programme of work in
this area be provided in the next budget submission.

19. With elections planned for October 2005 in accordance with the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, a small Electoral Unit consisting of four staff
(1 P-5, 1 General Service and 2 United Nations Volunteers) is proposed for UNMIL
(see A/58/539, para. 63). While the Advisory Committee understands that the
Mission intends to expand the Unit in the next budget period as elections draw
nearer, it emphasizes that planning for the elections should be done well in
advance. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the Mission intended to
employ 150 United Nations Volunteers to assist in the electoral process.

20. The Advisory Committee welcomes the establishment of a Programme
Planning and Assessment Unit in UNMIL in the Office of the Deputy Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Coordination,



5
A/58/591

Rehabilitation, Recovery and Reconstruction to assist other components in
planning, monitoring and evaluating programmes and projects (ibid., para. 67).
The Committee recommends that the functions of the Unit be expanded to
cover the entire Mission, rather than limiting them to programmes and projects
under the Deputy Special Representative.

21. The Advisory Committee was provided with a breakdown of the requirements
for the disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration programme,
which amount to $35,484,550. Of that amount, $15,650,000 is related to rations. The
Committee was informed that those costs could be reduced if the World Food
Programme became involved in the programme. In this connection, the Committee
recalls the statement made by the Secretary-General in his report to the Security
Council that it was imperative that not only disarmament and demobilization, but
also the initial phases of reintegration, be funded from the assessed peacekeeping
budget (S/2003/875, para. 111).

3. Operational requirements

22. The overall estimate for operational costs for the period from 1 August 2003 to
30 June 2004 amounts to $312,551,700 (see A/58/539, sect. II.A).

23. The largest requirement under operational costs, accounting for $107,380,100,
is for facilities and infrastructure. The Advisory Committee notes that delayed
deployment factors have been taken into account in the estimated requirement for
equipment (see A/58/539, para. 140). The Committee requests that in future it be
provided with a “deployment” schedule for all requirements under this heading
that would give a clear picture of the time frame for procurement and logistical
activities.

24. The estimated requirements under air transportation amount to $65,428,000.
As indicated in the proposed budget, the Mission is planning to maintain a fleet of
28 helicopters and 3 fixed-wing aircraft (ibid., para. 143). As it has done in the
case of other missions, the Advisory Committee requests UNMIL to explore the
possibility of using aircraft already at the disposal of the United Nations,
including MONUC aircraft, to transport troops that come from the region,
rather than incurring further expense for additional aircraft. The Committee
notes that the proposed Mission air fleet includes a Beechcraft 200 to provide for
movement of the head of Mission for liaison and negotiation purposes throughout
the subregion and that the aircraft can be reconfigured to support medical
evacuations. The Committee welcomes this and requests that, should additional
aircraft be deployed, care be taken to ensure that such aircraft are versatile.

25. The Advisory Committee was provided with a breakdown of travel costs for
both training and non-training purposes, amounting to $600,000 and $800,253
respectively. With regard to non-training travel, the Committee encourages the
Mission to make use of videoconferencing facilities where possible and to
reduce the number of staff travelling to the same meeting. In order to reduce
the cost of training-related travel, the Mission should attempt to identify
training opportunities that are as close as possible to Mission headquarters.

III. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee

26. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of UNMIL for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004 is indicated
in paragraph 152 of the proposed budget. In view of its comments in the present
report, the Advisory Committee recommends appropriation of an amount of
$564,494,300 gross ($559,284,300 net) for the operation of the Mission for the
11-month period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004, inclusive of the amount
of $47,462,700 previously authorized by the Committee for the period from 1
August to 31 December 2003. The Committee further recommends that the
total amount assessed for the period at this time not exceed $450 million. That
amount should provide ample resources to cover military and police personnel
costs should the deployment schedule as outlined in the proposed budget be
fully implemented (see para. 12 above). The Committee will review the
situation when it examines the estimates for the 2004/05 period.
