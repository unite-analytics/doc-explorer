Proposed programme budget outline for the biennium
2006-2007

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed programme budget
outline for the biennium 2006-2007 (A/59/415). In the course of its deliberations,
the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information and clarification.

2. The Committee notes from paragraph 2 of the report that, in establishing a
preliminary estimate for the biennium 2006-2007, the current level of appropriations
and related commitments, namely, $3,179.2 million, was taken as the starting point.
On that basis, the Secretary-General proposes a preliminary estimate of resources
for the biennium 2006-2007, expressed in initial 2004-2005 prices, amounting to
$3,359.2 million, as shown in the table contained in paragraph 2 of the report. As
indicated in paragraph 10, the preliminary estimate, excluding special political
missions, maintains the estimate of regular budget established activities at the same
level as the approved appropriations for the biennium 2004-2005 — an equivalent to
zero real growth.

3. The Advisory Committee recalls that the purpose of the budget outline is to
provide Member States with a preliminary indication of the resources that may be
required in the coming biennium. Once the outline is approved, the Secretary-
General prepares the budget on that basis. In accordance with General Assembly
resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986, these estimates can be either higher or
lower than the preliminary estimate approved on the basis of the budget outline.

4. As indicated in paragraph 3 of the report, an amount of $11.2 million would be
required for the full biennial provision in the biennium 2006-2007 for posts that are
partially funded in the current biennium. These include new posts at the

A/59/600

Professional level and above (costed at 50 per cent and 65 per cent for the General
Service and related categories on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee).

5. Paragraph 4 of the report indicates that one-time costs amounting to $21.7
million, included in the biennium 2004-2005, would not be required. These
provisions relate mainly to the strengthening of the security and safety of United
Nations operations, staff and premises. In addition, there were non-recurrent costs
for substantive and public information support related to the Eleventh United
Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the eleventh session of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the World Summit
on the Information Society.

6. An amount of $10.5 million for new or expanded activities or events foreseen
and/or mandated in the biennium 2006-2007 is included in the budget outline. The
resources, as indicated in paragraph 5 of the report, are foreseen to strengthen
human rights and humanitarian assistance, the economic sector, humanitarian
activities and the United Nations Office at Nairobi. The estimates also include the
requirements for public information support for the conferences and meetings,
mentioned therein, foreseen in the next biennium, as well as provisions to meet
requirements for after-service health insurance, reflecting the growth of the
population entitled as well as higher insurance costs.

7. In paragraph 4 of the report, it is indicated that the costs provided in the
biennium 2004-2005 for special political missions are treated as being of a recurrent
nature. The Committee notes that the initial provision for special political missions
in 2004-2005 amounted to $169.4 million. However, paragraph 6 of the outline
indicates that it is estimated that full biennial provision in 2006-2007 for special
political missions currently existing in the biennium 2004-2005 would exceed $350
million. Furthermore, although the present composition may change, it is not
anticipated that the overall level will decrease substantively. Taking this into
account, an increase of $180 million is included, thus putting the funding level for
special political missions at $349.4 million in the biennium 2006-2007.

8. The size of the contingency fund is discussed in paragraph 11 of the report of
the Secretary-General. The Committee notes that the Secretary-General recommends
that it be maintained at 0.75 per cent of the proposed outline for 2006-2007. The
Advisory Committee concurs with the Secretary-General’s proposal and points
out that it should be utilized in accordance with General Assembly resolutions
41/213 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987. Moreover, this should be brought to
the attention of governing bodies whenever decisions involving financial
implications are taken.

9. The Advisory Committee was informed that, using the adjustments
consequential to the first performance report for the biennium 2004-2005
(A/59/578), the 2006-2007 budget outline figure of $3,359.2 million would become
$3,483.7 million. However, the overall level of estimated requirements for 2006-
2007 will depend on the decisions of the General Assembly regarding the proposals
for security, special political missions and other revised estimates and programme
budget implications currently before the Fifth Committee. The Committee was
informed that, as at 6 December 2004, these would likely total $261.9 million,
including the delayed impact of growth (minus the deduction of one-time cost
elements). The Committee points out that this figure includes the impact of the
Secretary-General’s request for the discontinuation of cost-sharing for security.

Although the Advisory Committee has recommended that cost-sharing be
maintained, its recommendation would impact on estimates of income, rather
than expenditure, and thus do not affect the preliminary estimate for the
outline, which is based on expenditure only.

10. If the amount of $261.9 million is added to the $3,483.7 million mentioned
above, the total becomes $3,745.6 million, which would represent the projection
based on all the data provided thus far by the Secretariat. In this connection, the
Committee points out that the Secretariat is maintaining the estimate of an
additional $180 million for special political missions first calculated in October
2004. The Advisory Committee has been informed that the financial impact of
developments since then, if accepted by the General Assembly, could add at least
$30 million to that figure, not including any delayed impact for 2006-2007. Under
the circumstances, the Committee is of the opinion that it may be prudent to “round
up” the projection of $3,745.6 million to $3,760 million to take at least partial
account of potential charges for special political missions.

11. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General
Assembly adopt a preliminary estimate of $3,760 million for the biennium
2006-2007 at revised 2004-2005 rates.
