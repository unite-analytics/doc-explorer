Programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005

First performance report on the programme budget
for the biennium 2004-2005

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the first performance report of the Secretary-General on the programme
budget for the biennium 2004-2005 (A/59/578 and Add.1). During its consideration
of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information and clarifications.

2. In accordance with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee,1

endorsed by the General Assembly at its thirty-second session, in resolution 32/212
of 21 December 1977, the first performance report on the programme budget for the
biennium 2004-2005 identifies adjustments required owing to variations in the rates
of inflation and exchange and in standards assumed in the calculation of the initial
appropriations. The report also takes into account the additional mandates that the
General Assembly and the Security Council have approved after the appropriation
of the programme budget, unforeseen and extraordinary items that could not be
deferred to the second year of the biennium and decisions of policy-making organs
that, in the view of the Secretary-General, are best dealt with in the context of the
first performance report. The Committee finds the report well prepared, with
adequate technical information and analysis. The Committee has, however,
commented below on matters where, in its opinion, there is a need to present
information in a more transparent manner.

3. The revised requirements under the expenditure sections amount to $3,351.1
million, an increase of $172.0 million, or 5.4 per cent, as compared with the
appropriation level of $3,179.2 million approved in June 2004. The revised income
estimates for the biennium amount to $424.7 million, an increase of $9.4 million, or
2.3 per cent, as compared with the initial estimate of $415.3 million. Consequently,
revised net requirements amount to $2,926.4 million, an increase of $162.5 million,
or 5.9 per cent, as compared with the appropriated net requirements of $2,763.9

A/59/601

million (see General Assembly resolutions 58/271 A and B and 58/295) (A/59/578,
para. 3).

4. The Advisory Committee was informed that additional requirements for the
biennium 2004-2005 not included in the first performance report and under
consideration by the General Assembly would amount to some $312.7 million for
requests related to strengthening of security and special political missions and other
requirements. If approved, this would bring the total revised requirements for the
biennium 2004-2005 to some $3,663.8 million (see annex I to the present report).

5. The Advisory Committee recalls that, pursuant to General Assembly resolution
58/270 of 23 December 2003, the Board of Auditors examined the recosting
methodology of the United Nations regular budget. Recosting of the budget entails
the revision of budgeted estimates on the basis of adjustments to costing parameters.
These adjustments would take into account currency fluctuations, inflation and
changes in staff costs and vacancies. The Committee agrees with the Board that
the budget methodology currently in place at the United Nations is reasonable
(see A/59/400, para. 18).

6. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of the performance report
that, taking into account General Assembly resolution 58/270, paragraph 36, in
which the General Assembly decided to defer the appropriation of budgetary
provisions for the Joint Inspection Unit for the year 2005, the first performance
report includes recosting adjustments in respect of the provision for 2004 for the
Joint Inspection Unit, while no budgetary provision for 2005 or related recosting is
included.

7. The Advisory Committee was informed on the status of the contingency fund
for the biennium 2004-2005. The level of the contingency fund was approved by the
General Assembly in resolution 57/280 in the amount of $21.6 million. The balance
of the fund after the fifty-eighth session was $11.3 million and $7.5 million after the
fifty-ninth session proposals (see annex II to the present report). Under the
procedures of the contingency fund, the Secretary-General will be submitting a
consolidated statement of all revised estimates and statements of programme budget
implications considered thus far at the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly,
in respect to the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005.

8. As can be seen from the table in paragraph 6 of the performance report, the
increase of $171,953,500 in expenditures reflects the impact of the following
additional requirements:

(a) $7,445,700 under unforeseen and extraordinary expenses in respect of
peace and security, the International Court of Justice and inter-organizational
security measures in accordance with General Assembly resolution 58/273;

(b) $40,597,700 resulting from decisions of policy-making organs;

(c) $123,910,100 related to variations in budgetary assumptions, including
changes in exchange rates ($79,431,900), changes in inflationary assumptions
($32,814,000), adjustments to standard salary costs ($3,063,400) and vacancies
($8,600,800).

A/59/601

A. Unforeseen and extraordinary expenses

9. Paragraphs 9 to 11 of the performance report explain the additional
requirements of $7,445,700 resulting from unforeseen and extraordinary expenses,
which fall under the terms of General Assembly resolution 58/273 of 23 December
2003. Under the provisions of the resolution, commitments were entered into, as
follows: (a) $7,337,800 certified by the Secretary-General as relating to the
maintenance of peace and security; (b) $103,700 certified by the President of the
International Court of Justice as relating to unforeseen expenses in respect of the
Court; and (c) $4,200 for inter-organizational security measures.

10. Paragraph 11 of the performance report shows the breakdown of the
commitments in the amount of $7,337,800 certified by the Secretary-General as
relating to the maintenance of peace and security. These expenses relate to budget
sections 1, Overall policy-making, direction and coordination ($664,800); section 3,
Political affairs ($3,659,700); and section 24, Human rights ($3,013,300).

B. Decisions of policy-making organs

11. An additional requirement of $40.6 million relates to decisions of policy-
making organs. This amount includes (a) $39.7 million for strengthening the
security and safety of the United Nations operations, staff and premises, (b) $0.8
million for requirements of the Office of the President of the General Assembly and
(c) $0.04 million for the cost of holding a Security Council meeting in Nairobi (see
A/59/578, para. 14).

12. The issues related to strengthening the security and safety of the United
Nations operations, staff and premises are explained in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the
performance report. The updated costing parameters reflected in the report have
been applied to the resources initially approved by the General Assembly in its
resolution 58/295, which authorized the Secretary-General to enter into
commitments mostly for security infrastructure enhancements.

13. The requirements of the Office of the President of the General Assembly are
discussed in paragraphs 17 to 20 of the performance report. In its resolution 58/126
of 19 December 2003, the Assembly decided that the resources available to the
Office of the President of the General Assembly in personnel and other support
costs should be augmented from within existing resources. The Assembly also
decided that five additional posts should be made available to supplement current
support, of which three should be filled on an annual basis, following consultations
with the incoming President, beginning at the fifty-ninth session of the Assembly.
The Committee notes that two vacant posts (1 P-3 and 1 P-4) have been identified
within the existing establishment of the Department for General Assembly and
Conference Management. The remaining three posts (1 D-2, 1 D-1 and 1 General
Service (Other level)) have not been identified and an additional appropriation of
$815,000 is requested for the biennium 2004-2005. The Advisory Committee is of
the opinion that these remaining three posts should also be provided through
redeployment. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that the
amount of $815,000 be absorbed from within existing resources for the
biennium 2004-2005.

A/59/601

C. Variations in budgetary assumptions2

Exchange rates

14. The increase of $79.4 million in requirements is due to changes in exchange
rates, as discussed in paragraphs 26 to 30 of the performance report. The
methodology used by the Secretary-General in recosting the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations is in conformity with the recommendation of the Advisory Committee
that the Secretary-General should use such operational rates of exchange in the
recosting exercises as would allow for the lowest estimates in each case.3 Schedule
3 of the report provides detailed information on the operational rates of exchange in
2004 for all main duty stations. Annex I.A to the performance report shows the
breakdown of the additional requirement of $79.3 million due to changes in
exchange rates by expenditure sections of the programme budget for the biennium
2004-2005, and annex I.B shows the breakdown of the projected changes due to
changes in exchange rates by duty station, with the larger increases in Geneva
($54.9 million), Vienna ($13.0 million) and Santiago ($8.1 million).

15. The Advisory Committee notes that, as stated in paragraph 26 of the report, the
realized exchange rate from January to November 2004 has been applied to the first
eleven months of 2004 and the November rate applied to December 2004. For 2005,
either the average operational rate of exchange experienced thus far in the biennium
(the averaging method) or the November rate (the latest rate) has been applied for
each duty station, so as to allow for the lowest estimate for each duty station in
respect of requirements for the related currency. Adjustments resulting from actual
experience in 2005 will be reflected in the second performance report.

Inflation

16. Additional requirements of $32.8 million resulting from the application of
revised inflation rates are discussed in paragraphs 31 to 35 of the performance
report. Schedules 1, 2 and 4 show the revised inflation rates that affect all objects of
expenditure ($21.2 million related to Professional posts, $3.6 million related to
General Service posts and $7.0 million related to all non-post objects). Annex I.A to
the performance report shows the breakdown of the additional requirement of
$32.8 million due to revised inflation rates by expenditure sections of the
programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, and annex I.B shows the
breakdown of the projected changes due to inflation by duty station, with the larger
increases in New York ($14.9 million), Addis Ababa ($6.5 million) and Geneva
($5.6 million).

17. The Advisory Committee notes that the increase in requirements related to
non-post objects of $7.0 million includes the regular budget share of $0.4 million in
the estimated cost increase of $3.1 million in the insurance premium of the
malicious acts insurance policy covering the United Nations system staff operating
in duty stations with heightened security. This cost increase of $3.1 million is
budgeted and accounted for on a gross basis under section 31, Jointly financed
activities; the United Nations share would amount to $1.1 million ($0.4 million
under the regular budget and $0.7 million under the budgets of peacekeeping
operations and the International Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda).
The Committee was provided upon request with additional information on the
malicious acts insurance policy (see annex III to the present report).



5
A/59/601

Adjustments to standards costs

18. Adjustments to standard costs of $3.1 million reflect the net effect of changes
in salary standard costs ($1.9 million) and common staff costs ($1.2 million).
Increases in expenditure due to changes in staff assessment ($1.6 million) are offset
by an equivalent increase in related income from staff assessment shown under
income section 1 of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. Paragraphs
36 to 38 of the performance report provide information on the reasons for the
increases. Annex I.A to the performance report shows the breakdown of the
additional requirement of $3.1 million due to adjustments to standard costs by
sections of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, and annex I.B shows
the breakdown of the projected changes by duty station, with the largest increase in
New York ($15.0 million), offset largely by the decreases in Geneva ($8.1 million),
Addis Ababa ($3.4 million), Vienna ($2.3 million) and Bangkok ($1.4 million).

Vacancy

19. Additional requirements of $8.6 million would result from the adjustments to
vacancy factors for staff in the Professional and higher categories. The effective
budgeted rate for the budget for the biennium 2004-2005 was 6.1 per cent. For 2004,
the level of vacancies experienced is about 5.5 per cent. For 2005, it is assumed that
the same level of vacancies would be realized (see A/59/578, para. 39). Annex I.A
to the performance report shows the breakdown of the additional requirement of
$8.6 million due to changes in vacancy assumptions by sections of the programme
budget for the biennium 2004-2005, and annex I.B shows the breakdown of the
projected changes in vacancies by duty station, with the larger increases in New
York ($4.2 million), Geneva ($2.0 million) and Addis Ababa ($0.5 million).

20. For posts in the General Service and related categories of staff, the effective
budgeted rate for the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 was 3.9 per
cent. For 2004, the level of vacancies experienced for staff in the General Service
and related categories is about 3.2 per cent. For 2005, the Advisory Committee
notes that, in the light of the suspension of recruitment for this category of staff, it is
assumed that it would be premature to adjust the overall biennial vacancy rate and
such an adjustment, if required, would be considered on the basis of the information
available at the time of the preparation of the second performance report for the
biennium 2004-2005; therefore, no adjustment for vacancies for staff in the General
Service and related categories is included in the performance report (see A/59/578,
para. 41). The Committee was provided with vacancy statistics of authorized posts
under the regular budget, as at 31 October 2004 (see annex IV to the present report).

D. Other matters

Redeployment of posts

21. In its resolution 58/270, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-
General to commence, on an experimental basis, during the course of the
programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, with the redeployment of up to 50
posts, as necessary, to meet the evolving needs of the Organization in attaining its
mandated programmes and activities, in accordance with a number of principles, as
listed in paragraph 51 of the performance report. The Committee was briefed in
detail on the steps taken to comply with the General Assembly resolution, as



6
A/59/601

summarized in paragraphs 52 to 54 of the performance report. In 2004, it was not
possible to identify such posts. Explanations were provided on the inherent
difficulties in arriving at a listing of surplus staffing resources within a particular
programme and therefore available for redeployment to another programme. During
the preparation of the budget proposal for the biennium 2004-2005, some 800 posts
were considered for redeployment, taking into account the priority of mandated
activities. Moreover, the difficulty of identifying posts for redeployment was
partially the result of very low vacancy rates for Professional posts (4.9 per cent in
October 2004). The Committee was provided with a graph of changes in vacancy
rates in 2004 for Professional posts (see annex V to the present report).

22. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in paragraph 65 of its first report
on the proposed programme budget for 2004-2005,4 it pointed out that, as part
of normal personnel practice, the continuing need for a post should be
evaluated prior to filling that post again. Staff turnover does provide an
element of flexibility, especially if the staffing table is managed as a whole. In
this regard, the Committee stressed the need to view the allocation of posts as
dynamic, rather than static; posts need to be reviewed periodically to ensure
that their functions are consistent with current objectives. Moreover, the
Committee indicated in paragraph 75 of the above-mentioned report that
departments would not “own” particular posts at particular grade levels. The
Committee is disappointed with the apparent reluctance of the Secretariat thus
far to comply with the General Assembly’s directives in resolution 58/270. The
Committee believes that there should be greater efforts made to utilize the
flexibility given to the Secretary-General in implementing mandated
programmes, rather than proceeding automatically to propose new posts.

23. In this connection, the Committee was informed that, given the lessons learned
thus far, the strategies being employed will be adjusted to reflect a more proactive
approach, rather than a dependency on the existence of vacant posts. To this end,
strategies will focus on the forecasting of the posts which will become vacant due to
retirement within the period concerned. The same strategy is also being applied in
the review of staffing requirements in the formulation of budget proposals for the
biennium 2006-2007. In that context, the Committee was informed that lists have
already been transmitted to the heads of departments and offices, reflecting those
posts from which an incumbent is expected to retire during 2005 and the biennium
2006-2007, so as to better identify future opportunities for flexibility in the
management of staffing tables.

Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs

24. Paragraphs 48 to 50 of the performance report cover the issues related to the
mobilization of regular resources for the Repertory of Practice of the United Nations
Organs. As requested by the General Assembly in resolution 58/270, paragraph 44,
the performance report includes information on the possibilities for absorption with
existing resources. The Advisory Committee notes that no existing resources have
yet been identified for redeployment to enable work to proceed on the Repertory;
two departments, however, have indicated that they are examining the possibility of
rearranging resources.

25. The Advisory Committee notes that, with regard to the mobilization of
extrabudgetary resources, the Secretary-General, in his report on the Repertory of



7
A/59/601

Practice of United Nations Organs and the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security
Council (A/59/189) drew reference to paragraph 111 of the report of the Special
Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the
Role of the Organization, in which the Committee recommended that the General
Assembly review the possibility of establishing at its fifty-ninth session, a trust fund
for the preparation, updating and publication of the Repertory. The Advisory
Committee intends to comment further on the Repertory and the Repertoire,
including the timely production of the Repertory in all official languages, in the
context of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium
2006-2007.

United Nations Official Document System

26. The report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the United
Nations Official Document System (ODS) (A/59/578/Add.1) provides a review of
the increasing availability and expansion of the use of the system over the last two
bienniums. The report also presents an overview of improvements currently under
way to enhance the implementation and use of ODS at Headquarters and at offices
away from Headquarters.

27. The Advisory Committee notes the steady progress made in the
implementation of ODS at Headquarters and at offices away from Headquarters, as
stated in paragraphs 7 to 17 of document A/59/578/Add.1. New servers have been
installed and configured for the purpose of providing ODS access free of charge to
users through the Internet. The Committee was informed that the system is in place
and is being tested. In addition, direct linkages to General Assembly and Security
Council documents in all official languages are now provided on the United Nations
web site.

28. All offices away from Headquarters are loading their documents on ODS. The
Economic Commission for Africa is doing so on a pilot basis and the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific is doing so through the Dag
Hammarskjöld Library of the Department of Public Information. The Committee
was informed that new, more powerful and reliable document loading servers are
being shipped to offices away from Headquarters so as to facilitate the loading of
documents and improve the quality and reliability of the loading process. Efficiency
gains are expected both in time and resources, since documents no longer need to be
shipped and printing-on-demand will save storage space that was previously used
for storing large quantities of stock copies.

29. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 21 of the performance report
that one of the major concerns in implementing free access to ODS is ensuring
parity of all language versions of documents posted by offices away from
Headquarters. The majority of documents archived by offices away from
Headquarters are available only in the working languages of the duty stations or
specific intergovernmental organs. The Advisory Committee recommends that
the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management consider
the feasibility of ensuring full parity for language versions of all documents
posted on ODS.

E. Conclusions

30. With the exception of the reduction of $815,000 mentioned in paragraph
13 above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly
approve the revised estimates contained in the Secretary-General’s report,
subject to such adjustments as may be necessary as a result of its consideration
of matters now before it, including estimates related to special political missions
and security (see para. 4 above) and the consolidated statement of revised
estimates and programme budget implications (see para. 7 above).

Annex III
Background note on the malicious acts insurance policy

1. The malicious acts insurance policy was first instituted as a result of an
International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal ruling (forty-third
ordinary session, Judgement No. 402), taken in Geneva on 4 April 1980, which in
its considerations stated, inter alia, that “it is a fundamental principle of every
contract of employment that the employer will not require the employee to work in a
place which he knows or ought to know to be unsafe”. It further stated that “this
principle is to be applied with due regard to the nature of the employment”, for
some types of which there are “unavoidable risks”. The Tribunal suggested that the
test as to whether the risk attached to the nature of employment is abnormal “might
be to consider whether an insurance company could … properly demand an
additional premium for cover against the risk ... If so, the risk would be abnormal”.
The Tribunal concluded that “an employee is not obliged to run abnormal risks for
the benefit of his employer, at any rate unless he is given insurance cover, … [and]
that it might be irresponsible to require a staff member to return to a high risk area
without offering him full insurance cover”. Therefore, by its very nature, the policy
is considered as an administrative matter pertaining to terms and conditions of
service of the United Nations system staff.

2. The malicious acts insurance policy is a voluntary insurance programme,
which until recently has been managed by the Office of the United Nations Security
Coordinator on behalf of the Inter-Agency Security Management Network. At
present it is managed by the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts
of the Department of Management. The selection of the insurer is undertaken
through the procurement process established by the Financial Regulations and Rules
of the United Nations. Participation in the policy can be terminated at any time by a
subscriber.

3. The scope and nature of the coverage for United Nations system personnel has
been determined by the subscribing organizations. Although coverage conditions
and general policy terms were negotiated by the Office of the United Nations
Security Coordinator (currently by the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and
Accounts) with the insurer, on behalf of the Inter-Agency Security Management
Network of the High Level Committee on Management, the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator and the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and
Accounts have no direct authority over the policy terms and conditions; rather, they
act as a “broker” for the participating subscribers.

4. The following organizations are participating in the malicious acts insurance
policy: the United Nations, including its funds and programmes, tribunals, special
missions and peacekeeping operations, the International Trade Centre
UNCTAD/WTO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health
Organization/Pan American Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation
Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the
International Organization for Migration, the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-

Ban Treaty Organization. The last three organizations are non-United Nations
system organizations subscribed for the policy.

5. With regard to the inclusion of countries under the policy, this has been
determined in the past by the security phase in effect and the threat to United
Nations system personnel. However, during its annual meeting in the spring of
2003, and in response to rising global threats to the United Nations system
personnel operating in the field, the Inter-Agency Security Management Network
reached a consensus to broaden the policy to have worldwide coverage with the
exception of 10 countries where United Nations system headquarters are located
(United States of America, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland). The High Level Committee on Management approved the Network’s
decision in 2003, and the expanded malicious acts insurance policy coverage came
into effect on 1 January 2004. Therefore, at present, the malicious acts insurance
policy is a global insurance policy.

6. The policy covers malicious acts which are defined as involving death or
disability (permanent or partial) caused directly or indirectly by war, invasion,
hostility, acts of foreign enemies, whether war be declared or not, civil war,
revolution, rebellion, insurrection, military or usurped power, riots or civil
commotion, sabotage, explosion of war weapons, terrorist activities (whether
terrorists are the country’s own nationals or not), murder or assault by foreign
enemies or any attempted threat, occurring in a covered country. The policy
establishes certain conditions that are required to be fulfilled prior to submission of
a claim. The coverage is not effective unless appropriate security clearance has been
obtained. It is the responsibility of the individual staff member to obtain appropriate
security clearance from the designated official of the area to be visited prior to
departure. Security clearance is mandatory for only official travel to areas that have
a declared United Nations security phase in effect, as well as for travel on home
leave. A staff member who fails to obtain security clearance prior to travel will void
the insurance coverage for the period of travel. The insurance covers only staff
members. Dependants are not covered.

7. Benefits under this policy are as follows:

(a) For staff in the Professional category whose duty station is one of the
designated countries, the benefits are $500,000 per person for death or permanent
total disability and payment according to the “continental scale” for partial
disability. In the latter case, the policy defines the percentage scale for benefits
payable in the event of partial disability;

(b) For Professional internationally recruited staff members, experts and
consultants on mission, travel or daily subsistence allowance status and other
official visitors in the designated countries, the benefits are $500,000 per person for
death or permanent total disability and payment according to the “continental scale”
for permanent partial disability;

(c) For internationally and nationally recruited General Service or Field
Service staff members and those paid according to the Field Service salary scale, the
benefits are 10 times the annual salary up to a maximum of $500,000 for death or
permanent total disability and payment according to the “continental scale” for
partial disability. Annual salary is defined as the net salary in effect for the insured
person’s level and step at the time of the incident at the duty station. All additional
allowances, that is, spouse and child benefits, are excluded in calculations.
