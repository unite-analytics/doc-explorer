Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and to 30 June 1999 after receipt of the revised estimates of
Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the MINURSO and UNMOT. The Committee points out that
Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations revised estimates for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) 1999 were not submitted by the Secretary-General and was
(A/52/730/Add.3) and the United Nations Mission of informed that such a submission was not contemplated by the
Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) (A/52/772/Add.2). During Secretary-General. The Committee requests that, in preparing
its consideration of these items, the Committee met with the next budget estimates of MINURSO and UNMOT, the
representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided Secretary-General take fully into account the performance
additional information. experience of the Missions in previous periods.
2. In paragraph 5 of its report concerning the general
aspects of the financing of peacekeeping operations
(A/52/860) and paragraph 1 of document A/52/860/Add.8,
the Committee indicated that it had postponed consideration
of the proposed budgets of MINURSO and UNMOT for the
period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 in view of the
pending action by the Security Council. In paragraphs 4 and
10 of document A/52/860/Add.8, the Committee indicated
that its recommendations on the bridging appropriation and
assessments for the maintenance of MINURSO and UNMOT
during the four-month period from 1 July to 31 October 1998
was without prejudice to such position as the Committee
might take on requirements for the period from 1 July 1998

3. The proposed budget of the United Nations Mission for
the Referendum in the Western Sahara for the period from 1
July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amounts to $65,053,200 gross
($60,972,000 net) (A/52/730/Add.3). It provides for the
maintenance of the Mission at the authorized strength of 203
military observers, 186 contingent personnel (150
engineering unit personnel, 26 medical support personnel and
10 staff officers), 7 force orderly personnel and 81 civilian
police observers. The civilian establishment consists of 285
international staff (95 Professional staff, 125 General Service

personnel), 105 locally recruited personnel and 10 observers 1148 (1998) of 26 January 1998, in which the Council
from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) approved the resumption and completion of the identification
(A/52/730/Add.3, annex II.C). The Committee was informed activities and the redeployment of the engineering unit
that, as at 31 August 1998, the actual military and civilian required for demining activities and additional administrative
police personnel deployed in the mission area consisted of costs (A/52/730/Add.3, paras. 1, 2 and 17). Subsequently,
199 military observers, 246 contingent personnel (160 in its resolution 1198 (1998) of 18 September 1998, the
engineering personnel (including staff officers), 58 demining Security Council extended the mandate of the Mission until
personnel and 28 medical support personnel), 7 force orderly 31 October 1998. The Committee was informed that at the
personnel and 81 civilian police observers. The civilian staff present time no information is available as regards possible
deployed comprised 246 international staff, 98 local staff and changes in the Mission’s mandate.
10 OAU observers. In this connection, the Committee recalls
that, of the Mission’s authorized civilian staffing complement,
176 international and 30 local staff are required for the
resumption of the identification process and a further 7
international and 10 local staff are to provide support for
demining and engineering activities and to meet the logistical
requirements of the Mission (A/52/730/Add.2, para. 23).
4. As indicated in paragraphs 3 and 16 of document
A/52/730/Add.3, the proposed budget for the period from 1
July 1998 to 30 June 1999 corresponds to the maintenance
of the resources already in the mission area for the period
ending 30 June 1998, with the exclusion of two demining
platoons (63 personnel), which were to be repatriated by 30
June 1998. In this connection, the Advisory Committee was
informed that these two demining platoons were not deployed
until early August 1998 and were expected to leave the
mission area by the third week of October 1998 (see annex
I to the present report).
5. Upon inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed
that memoranda of understanding have not yet been concluded
with the troop-contributing Governments in respect of the
military contingent personnel (engineering and demining
units) already deployed in early August 1998. The Committee
cautions that the deployment of troops and equipment, prior
to the signing of memoranda of understanding with troop-
contributing countries, may lead to a situation where the
United Nations becomes liable for the settlement of claims
in excess of the actual needs of the Mission.
6. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 16 of
document A/52/730/Add.3 that some 59 per cent of the
proposed budget is based on standard cost ratios contained
in the standard ratio/cost manual, while 41 per cent covers
mission-specific costs (see A/52/730/Add.3, annex II.A).
7. The proposed budget of MINURSO for the period from
1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 reflects an increase of
$17,651,100 gross, or some 37 per cent over the revised
budget for the previous period. The increase is attributable
to the strengthening of the Mission pursuant to Security

8. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 5 of
document A/52/730/Add.3 that the current operational plan
of the Mission, with the exception of the strength of the
military component as outlined in paragraphs 7 and 8 of
document A/52/730, remains unchanged.
9. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 21
September 1998, outstanding assessments amounted to $70.2
million. With respect to the status of reimbursement to troop-
contributing Governments, it was confirmed that payments
have been made through June 1996 (see A/52/730/Add.3,
para. 13). As at 31 August 1998, the total expenditure for the
period from 1 July to 31 August 1998 (Headquarters and
field) amounted to some $8.6 million gross. Of this total,
unliquidated obligations totalled some $3.2 million.
10. In his letter of 28 September 1998 (see annex I to the
present report), the United Nations Controller sought the
Advisory Committee’s concurrence in the entering into
commitments in an amount not exceeding $2,372,000 for the
deployment and related commercial communications
requirements of the demining platoons and the increase in
cost of helicopter operations.
11. The letter of reply from the Chairman of the Committee
to the Secretary-General, dated 8 October 1998, is
reproduced in annex II to the present report.
12. In its resolution 52/228 B of 26 June 1998, the General
Assembly approved for appropriation and assessment the
amount of $22,749,540 gross ($21,473,540 net) for the
period from 1 July to 31 October 1998, inclusive of the
amount of $1,149,540 for the support account for
peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 1998 to
30 June 1999. Taking into account the fact that the additional
costs referred to above will be absorbed and the pattern of
expenditures of the Mission (see para. 9 above), the Advisory
Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve
the appropriation and assessment of the additional amount of
$37,250,460 gross ($34,445,260 net) for the operations of
MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999,

13. The proposed budget of the United Nations Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) for the period from 1 July
1998 to 30 June 1999 amounts to $22,282,100 gross
($20,998,100 net) (A/52/772/Add.2). It provides for the
maintenance of the Mission at the authorized strength of 120
military observers, 2 civilian police, 68 international staff (36
Professional, 12 General Service, 16 Field Service and 4
Security Service) and 143 locally recruited staff
(A/52/772/Add.2, annex II.C). Upon inquiry, the Advisory
Committee was informed that as at 30 September 1998 the
actual military and civilian personnel deployed consisted of
34 military observers, 2 civilian police, 56 international staff
(29 Professional, 8 General Service, 15 Field Service and 4
Security Service) and 112 local staff. The large number of
vacant posts in the Mission is the result of the precarious
security situation which has impeded UNMOT operations for
quite some time (see S/1998/754, paras. 18-23).
14. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 23 of
document A/52/772/Add.2 that some 30 per cent of the
proposed budget is based on standard cost ratios contained
in the standard ratio/cost manual, while 70 per cent covers
mission-specific costs and other items that vary from the
standards (see A/52/772/Add.2, annex II.A). Upon inquiry,
the Committee was informed that a review of peacekeeping
missions reveals that military contingents share a larger
portion of expenditures based on standard ratios and costs.
UNMOT is an observer mission and does not have military
contingents.
15. The proposed budget of UNMOT for the period from
1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 reflects an increase of
$5,711,200 gross, or 34.5 per cent over the revised budget
for the previous period of $16,570,900 gross
(A/52/772/Add.2, paras. 5 and 6 and annex I). The increase
is attributable to the expansion of the Mission’s mandate
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1138 (1997) of 14
November 1997 (A/52/772/Add.2, paras. 2 and 6). Since
then, in its resolution 1167 (1998) of 14 May 1998, the
Security Council extended the mandate of UNMOT until 15
November 1998. The Advisory Committee was informed that
at the present time no information is available as regards
possible changes to the Mission’s mandate.
16. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was informed
that, as at 15 September 1998, outstanding assessments
amounted to $10.6 million. As at 15 September 1998, the

expenditures as at 31 August 1998. Of this total, unliquidated
obligations totalled some $1.2 million as at 25 September
1998.
17. In his letter of 28 September 1998 (see annex III to the
present report), the United Nations Controller sought the
Advisory Committee’s concurrence in the entering into
commitments in an amount not exceeding $4,149,700 for the
acquisition of 28 additional armoured vehicles and
communications equipment for the operations of the United
Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan.
18. The letter of reply from the Chairman of the Committee
to the Secretary-General, dated 8 October 1998, is
reproduced in annex IV to the present report.
19. The Advisory Committee recalls that in its resolution
52/229 B of 26 June 1998, the General Assembly approved
the appropriation and assessment of $8,015,120 gross
($7,587,120 net) for the maintenance of UNMOT for the
period from 1 July to 31 October 1998, inclusive of an
amount of $415,120 for the support account for peacekeeping
operations for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
Taking into account the pattern of expenditure of the Mission
(see para. 16 above), and the amount already approved for
appropriation and assessment for the period 1 July to 31
October 1998 for UNMOT, the Advisory Committee
recommends that the General Assembly approve the
appropriation and assessment of the additional amount of
$11,984,880 gross ($11,128,880 net) for the operations of
UNMOT for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999,
subject to the extension of the mandate of UNMOT by the
Security Council.

Annex I
Letter dated 28 September 1998 from the United Nations Controller
to the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

The General Assembly, by its resolution 52/228 B of 26 June 1998, decided to
appropriate the amount of $22,749,540 gross ($21,473,540 net) for the maintenance of the
United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for the period
from 1 July to 31 October 1998, inclusive of an amount of $1,149,540 for the support account
for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999. The amount
of $22,749,540 included the absorption of $184,200 representing MINURSO’s share of the
pro-rated cost of the United Nations Logistics Base in Brindisi, as decided by the General
Assembly in its resolution 52/1 B of 26 June 1998. The Assembly’s decision to provide a
four-month bridging appropriation initially for the maintenance of the Mission was based on
the Advisory Committee’s recommendation contained in paragraph 4 of its report of 13 May
1998 (A/52/860/Add.8).

It will be recalled that, in paragraph 3 of his report of 16 March 1998 (A/52/730/Add.3),
the Secretary-General had indicated that “the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 1998
to 30 June 1999 corresponds to the maintenance of the resources already in the mission area
for the period ending 30 June 1998 (see A/52/730/Add.2), with the exclusion of two demining
platoons, which are to be repatriated by 30 June 1998”. In fact, as indicated in paragraph 5
below, these two demining platoons were not deployed until early August 1998 and are now
expected to leave the mission area by the third week of October 1998.

Since then, by its resolution 1198 (1998) of 18 September 1998, the Security Council
has extended the mandate of MINURSO until 31 October 1998.

The Secretary-General, in his reports of 10 July 1998 (S/1998/634), 18 August 1998
(S/1998/775) and 11 September 1998 (S/1998/849), informed the Security Council of
developments in the situation concerning Western Sahara including, inter alia, the
identification process, the deployment of military personnel in preparation for the full
deployment of MINURSO and progress in the finalization of the status-of-forces agreements
between the United Nations and the Governments of Algeria, Mauritania and Morocco.

In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his latest report to the Council (S/1998/849), the Secretary-
General informed the Council of the deployment of the remainder of the military contingent
personnel (engineering and demining units) in early August 1998, in accordance with the
provisions of the military agreement between MINURSO and Morocco of 23 July 1998. In
addition, the Council was informed that the demining unit would have completed its demining
activities by the time its contract expires on 25 October 1998.

In paragraphs 20, 21 and 23 of the aforementioned report, the Secretary-General
informed the Council of the completion of the identification of over 147,000 applicants.
However, the Secretary-General expressed his concern that the question of the identification
of applicants from the H41, H61 and J51/52 tribal groupings remains outstanding. He also
stated that the signature of the status-of-forces agreements is long overdue and impedes the
progress towards holding a referendum in Western Sahara. In order to allow his Personal
Envoy’s consultations with the two parties to take place, and for an assessment of the situation
thereafter, the Secretary-General recommended that the mandate of MINURSO be extended
until 31 October 1998.



A/53/474

The next report of the Secretary-General is expected to be submitted to the Security
Council 30 days from the date of the extension of the mandate of MINURSO. At this time,
no information is available as regards changes, if any, to the Mission’s mandate.

The authorized strength of the Mission is 203 military observers, 186 contingent
personnel, 7 force orderly personnel and 81 civilian police observers, supported by a civilian
establishment of 285 international staff, 105 local staff and 10 observers from the
Organization of African Unity (OAU). As at 31 August 1998, the actual staff deployed in the
mission area consisted of 199 military observers, 246 contingent personnel, 7 force orderly
personnel, 81 civilian police, 246 international staff, 98 local staff and 10 OAU observers.

It is therefore anticipated that requirements under civilian personnel costs would be
less than initially envisaged, taking into account the completion of the identification process
and pending the resolution of the identification of the three contested tribal groupings.

However, after the original budget was submitted, a change in the contract on the lease
of three helicopters, effective 1 May 1998, has resulted in additional requirements of
$1.6 million.

In view of the foregoing, it is likely that the original cost estimates for the 12-month
period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, as originally submitted in document
A/52/730/Add.3, may be sufficient to accommodate the costs related to the deployment and
related commercial communications requirements of the demining unit for the period from
July to October 1998, as well as the increase in cost of helicopter operations, which were not
envisaged at the time the original estimates were completed and submitted.

I would therefore request the concurrence of the Advisory Committee in the entering
into commitments in an amount not exceeding $2,372,000 for the deployment and related
commercial communications requirements of the demining platoons and the increase in cost
of helicopter operations.

Taking into account that the Assembly has already approved an appropriation and
assessment for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1998, I believe that an appropriation and
assessment by the General Assembly of $42,303,660 gross ($39,498,460 net) for the period
from 1 November 1998 to 30 June 1999 ought to be sufficient to meet the maintenance
requirements of the Mission as well as the additional requirement for military personnel costs,
helicopter operations and commercial communications. At the same time, it should be
understood that should the situation change substantially, we may have to revert to the issue.

Annex II
Letter dated 8 October 1998 from the Chairman of the Advisory
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to the
Secretary-General

The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered
the Controller’s letter of 28 September 1998, seeking the Committee’s concurrence in the
entering into commitments in an amount not exceeding $2,372,000 for the deployment and
related commercial communications requirements of the demining platoons and the increase
in cost of helicopter operations in the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO).

As indicated in the Controller’s letter, in its resolution 52/229 B of 26 June 1998, the
General Assembly decided to appropriate the amount of $22,749,540 gross ($21,473,540
net) for the maintenance of MINURSO for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1998,
inclusive of the amount of $1,149,540 for the support account for peacekeeping operations
for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.

The Advisory Committee notes from the Controller’s letter that it is likely that the
original cost estimates for the 12-month period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
(A/52/730/Add.3), amounting to $65,053,200 gross ($60,972,000 net) will be sufficient to
accommodate the costs related to the deployment and related commercial communications
requirements of the demining unit for the period from July to October 1998, as well as the
increase in cost of helicopter operations, which were not envisaged at the time the original
estimates were prepared. In this connection, the Committee notes that it is anticipated that
requirements under civilian personnel costs would be less than initially envisaged, taking into
account the completion of the identification process and pending the resolution of the
identification of the three contested tribal groupings. Under the circumstances, the Committee
expects that the requirements described in the Controller’s letter will not lead to a request
for additional appropriation.

The Committee understands that the request for additional commitment authority is in
view of the fact that the current appropriation is only for the period ending 31 October 1998
and is pending such action as the General Assembly may take on the request for appropriations
for the period remaining after 31 October 1998 (1 November 1998–30 June 1999).

However, upon inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the request for an
additional commitment authority of $2,372,000 did not take into account the expenditure
experience of MINURSO, thus far. The Committee has previously indicated that the most
basic problem in budgeting for peacekeeping operations appears to relate to the fact that the
experience of the previous period is not adequately taken into account when preparing
estimates for the next period (A/52/860, para. 21).

Based on the pattern of expenditures of MINURSO, the Advisory Committee believes
that there is no need to authorize you to enter into an additional commitment authority in the
amount of $2,372,000 for the period prior to 31 October 1998. Taking into account the
amount that the General Assembly has already approved of $22,749,540 gross ($21,473,540
net) for the maintenance of MINURSO for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1998, the
Committee intends to review the requirements of the Mission for the entire period from 1 July

1998 to 30 June 1999, as submitted in document A/52/730/Add.3, together with further
clarifications provided to the Committee, and report to the General Assembly at its fifty-third
session accordingly.

Annex III
Letter dated 28 September 1998 from the United Nations Controller
to the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

The General Assembly, by its resolution 52/229 B of 26 June 1998, decided to
appropriate the amount of $8,015,120 gross ($7,587,120 net) for the maintenance of UNMOT
for the period form 1 July to 31 October 1998, inclusive of an amount of $415,120 for the
support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
The amount of $8,015,120 included the absorption of $66,500 representing UNMOT’s share
of the pro-rated cost of the United Nations Logistics Base in Brindisi, as decided by the
General Assembly in its resolution 52/1 B of 26 June 1998. The Assembly’s decision to
provide a four-month bridging appropriation initially for the maintenance of the Mission was
based on the Advisory Committee’s recommendation which, inter alia, pointed out that there
were a number of unresolved issues that could impact on the development of the Mission and
on its resource requirements (A/52/860/Add.8, paras. 8 to 10).

Since then, by its resolution 1167 (1998) of 14 May 1998, the Security Council has
extended the mandate of UNMOT until 15 November 1998.

On 13 August 1998, the Secretary-General submitted his interim report on UNMOT
to the Security Council (S/1998/754 and Add.1). In paragraphs 10 to 12 of that report, the
Secretary-General made reference to the incident of 20 July 1998, in which four members
of the UNMOT team based in Garm were murdered. The Secretary-General further reported
that UNMOT immediately suspended its activities in the field and sent all teams back to base
in Dushanbe. The replacement of military observers ending their tour of duty has been
suspended to reduce the excess personnel in Dushanbe.

In view of the security situation in the mission area, the Secretary-General stated in
paragraph 23 of the same report that the Mission would be provided with additional hard-
skinned vehicles and better communications equipment in order to give its personnel at least
passive protection. In the addendum to the report (S/1998/754/Add.1), it was indicated that
the estimated cost of 28 armoured vehicles and the communications equipment was
approximately $4.1 million.

The President of the Security Council, in his letter dated 28 August 1998 (S/1998/818),
informed the Secretary-General that the members of the Council had taken note of the
information contained in paragraph 23 of the report as well as the financial implications
information contained in the addendum to the report.

The next report of the Secretary-General is expected to be submitted to the Security
Council prior to the expiration of the current mandate of UNMOT on 15 November 1998.
At this time, no information is available as regards changes, if any, to the Mission’s mandate.

The authorized strength of the Mission is 120 military observers, 2 civilian police, 68
international staff and 143 locally recruited staff. The actual staff deployed as at the end of
August is 69 military observers, 2 civilian police, 54 international staff and 116 local staff.

It is therefore anticipated that requirements in respect of military and civilian costs
would be substantially less than initially envisaged if the prevailing security situation remains
unchanged.

In view of the foregoing, it is likely that the original cost estimates for the 12-month
period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 as originally submitted in document A/52/772/Add.2



A/53/474

may be sufficient to accommodate the armoured vehicles and communications equipment that
were not envisaged at the time the original estimates were completed and submitted.

I would therefore request the concurrence of the Advisory Committee in the entering
into commitments in an amount not exceeding $4,149,700 for the acquisition of 28 additional
armoured vehicles and communications equipment.

Taking into account that the Assembly has already approved an appropriation and
assessment for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1998, I believe that an appropriation and
assessment by the General Assembly of $14,682,100 gross ($13,826,100 net) for the period
from 1 November 1998 to 30 June 1999 ought to be sufficient to meet the maintenance
requirements of the Mission as well as the additional requirement for military armoured
vehicles and communications equipment. At the same time, it should be understood that should
the situation change substantially, we may have to revert to the issue.

Annex IV
Letter dated 8 October 1998 from the Chairman of the Advisory
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to the
Secretary-General

The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered
the Controller’s letter of 28 September 1998, seeking the Committee’s concurrence in the
entering into commitments in an amount not exceeding $4,149,700 for the acquisition of 28
additional armoured vehicles and communications equipment for the operations of the United
Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT).

As indicated in the Controller’s letter, in its resolution 52/229 B of 26 June 1998, the
General Assembly decided to appropriate the amount of $8,015,120 gross ($7,587,120 net)
for the maintenance of UNMOT for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1998, inclusive of
the amount of $415,120 for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period
from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.

The Advisory Committee notes from the Controller’s letter that it is likely that the
original cost estimates for the 12-month period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
(A/52/772/Add.2), amounting to $22,282,100 gross ($20,998,100 net) will be sufficient to
accommodate the armoured vehicles and communications equipment, which were not
envisaged at the time the original estimates were prepared. In this connection, the Committee
notes that it is anticipated that requirements in respect of military and civilian costs would
be substantially less than initially envisaged if the prevailing security situation remains
unchanged. Under the circumstances, the Committee expects that the requirements described
in the Controller’s letter will not lead to a request for additional appropriation.

The Committee understands that the request for additional commitment authority is in
view of the fact that the current appropriation is only for the period ending 31 October 1998
and is pending such action as the General Assembly may take on the request for appropriations
for the period remaining after 31 October 1998 (1 November 1998–30 June 1999).

However, upon inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the request for an
additional commitment authority of $4,149,700 did not take into account past performance
experience of UNMOT. The Committee has indicated in the past that the most basic problem
in budgeting for peacekeeping operations appears to relate to the fact that the experience of
the previous period is not adequately taken into account when preparing estimates for the next
period (A/52/860, para. 21).

Based on the pattern of expenditures of UNMOT, the Advisory Committee believes
that there is no need to authorize you to enter into an additional commitment authority of
$4,149,700 at this time. Taking into account the amount that the General Assembly has already
approved of $8,015,120 gross ($7,587,120 net) for the maintenance of UNMOT for the period
from 1 July to 31 October 1998, the Committee intends to review the requirements of the
Mission for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, as submitted in document
A/52/772/Add.2, together with further clarifications provided to the Committee, and report
to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session accordingly.
