UNOPS: financial, budgetary and administrative matters

Revised budget estimates for the biennium 2000-2001,
budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003, and report on
the level of the operational reserve

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) has considered the
report of the Executive Director of the United Nations
Office for Project Services (UNOPS) on the revised
budget estimates for the biennium 2000-2001, the
estimates for the biennium 2002-2003 and the level of
the operational reserve (DP/2001/28). The Committee
also had before it, as background documentation, the
UNOPS interim financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2000. During its consideration of these
items, the Committee met with the Executive Director
of UNOPS and his colleagues, who provided additional
information.

2. The Advisory Committee notes that the revised
estimates of income and expenditure for 2000-2001
and the corresponding projections for 2002-2003 have
been greatly affected by the changes experienced in
2000-2001. Most important among these changes was
the shortfall of project income in 2000, due to the 20
per cent reduction in delivery on the project portfolio.
This resulted from the cancellation or delay of
approved project budgets, mostly from the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The
Committee exchanged views with the Executive

Director on this matter (see also document DP/2001/19,
paragraphs 19-22).

3. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that
this experience should be carefully analysed with a
view to refining current procedures and methods by
which UNOPS fixed assets can be adjusted to take
account of fluctuations such as those referred to in
paragraph 2 above, more quickly than is possible at the
moment. To this end, the nature and profile of UNOPS
contracts for personal services should be re-examined.
UNOPS should also increase its efforts to examine the
structure of its business portfolio with a view to
refining the criteria taken into account to evaluate the
commitment of clients and UNOPS own capacity to
deliver. In addition to this, the Committee is of the
opinion that the termination or postponement of project
budgets should be managed through consultation of all
parties concerned and in such a way as to minimize the
financial consequences and their impact on UNOPS.

4. Paragraph 33 of the report (DP/2001/28) indicates
that the Executive Director is “concerned that UNOPS
might face an experience similar to that of 1994, when
prolonged deliberations regarding its future status had
a negative impact on its operations, thus resulting in
lower levels of acquisition and delivery”. This is borne

DP/2001/29

out by the most recent data made available to the
Committee. The Committee shares the concern of the
Executive Director, given that UNOPS is a unique and
vital institution that applies business management
models to programme delivery. The Committee notes
that the Office of Internal Oversight Services has been
requested by the Secretary-General to conduct a review
of UNOPS but that the report will not be available in
time for the consideration by the Executive Board of
document DP/2001/28. The Committee is of the view
that it is incumbent on the Secretary-General to inform
Member States expeditiously of the results of the
review. Furthermore, the Committee also recalls the
Executive Board request, contained in paragraph 4 of
decision 2000/22 of 28 September 2000, for the
Administrator of UNDP and the Executive Director of
UNOPS to submit at its annual session 2001 a detailed
report on progress achieved on all recommendations of
the evaluation report of February 2000 (the “Vinde
evaluation report”).

Revised administrative budget for the
biennium 2000-2001

5. The revised estimates for the biennium 2000-
2001 are based on actual delivery, income and
expenditure for 2000 and on projections for 2001. Total
project delivery for the biennium 2000-2001 is
estimated at $1,087.1 million ($471.1 million of actual
project delivery in 2000 and $616.0 million projected
for 2001). The revised income projection for 2000-
2001 amounts to $105.3 million ($48.5 million of
actual income in 2000 and $56.8 million of projected
income for 2001), comprising $84.2 million from
project implementation, $14.5 million from services
and $6.6 million from other sources (see document
DP/2001/28, paras. 8-13 and table 1). This compares to
the revised estimates for total project delivery of
$1,180 million for the biennium ($590.0 million per
year) and income projected at $103.2 million ($51.6
million per year) indicated in DP/2000/37.

6. The Advisory Committee recommends that future
submissions include, in table 1, an additional column
indicating the initial targeted figures, which, for
example, in the case of project delivery, would
facilitate comparison with the actual and projected
figures presented therein.

7. The revised budget for UNOPS administrative
expenditures for the biennium 2000-2001 amounts to

$110.6 million ($55.3 million of actual expenditure in
2000 and $55.3 million projected for 2001). As
indicated in paragraph 14 of document DP/2001/28, the
revised estimates represent an increase of $4.3 million,
or 4 per cent, over the existing approved budget of
$106.3 million for 2000-2001. The changes, by object
of expenditure, are shown in table 2 of the document.

8. The revised budget for the biennium 2000-2001
for administrative expenditures also reflects the
distinction between recurring and non-recurring
administrative expenditures. Table 1 indicates a
provision of $107.6 million under recurring and
$3.0 million under non-recurring administrative
expenditures. The Advisory Committee notes that the
2000 budget provided for $3.1 million under non-
recurring expenditures, against which expenditures of
$3.0 million have been recorded. As indicated in
paragraph 14 of the report, no other provision was
included nor is further revision envisaged in this
regard.

9. The Advisory Committee further notes from
paragraphs 15-17 and table 3 that the Executive
Director proposes to establish 45 additional posts at the
P-5 level and below, offset by 32 posts to be abolished,
increasing the number of established posts from 419 to
432 for the biennium 2000-2001. The Committee
recommends acceptance of this proposal.

10. The Advisory Committee was informed that in
view of the changes mentioned in paragraph 2 above,
several measures had been introduced during the
current biennium with the aim of balancing the budget.
They included deferral of investments, particularly
those relating to equipment, a staffing review and
redeployment of staff, and a freeze on new recruitment
and reclassifications. In addition, the establishment of
offices or implementation units away from
headquarters are to be undertaken only when
identifiable savings would be generated. Moreover,
instead of issuing budgets to individual units, as an
incentive-based approach, resources would be released
from a pool only as additional income is generated.
The Committee commends UNOPS for the initiatives
taken.

Administrative budget for the
biennium 2002-2003

11. Table 1 of the budget report shows that, for the
biennium 2002-2003, total project delivery is projected
at $1,264.0 million ($632.0 million per year). This
constitutes, as indicated in paragraph 34 of the report,
an increase of $176.9 million, or 16.6 per cent, over the
revised 2000-2001 delivery projections. The revised
income projection for the biennium 2002-2003
amounts to $116.2 million ($58.1 million per year) and
comprises 97.3 million from project implementation,
$16.0 million from services and $2.8 million from
other sources.

12. The Advisory Committee was further informed
that of the project portfolio, United Nations agencies
held the largest share (47 per cent), followed by
Management Service Agreements (20 per cent), UNDP
General Resources (20 per cent) and UNDP Trust
Funds (13 per cent).

13. However, as a result of the reorganization
launched at the end of 2000, focusing on a
reorientation of UNOPS around client accounts, the
Executive Director of UNOPS indicates, in paragraph
32 of the report, that changes in structure, location,
technology and work processes are most likely to occur
and that the related details of these changes are still
being refined, including an assessment of the financial
impact. In view of this, it is pointed out that, when this
work is completed, UNOPS “will bring details of the
new arrangements to the attention of the Executive
Board, and submit, if appropriate, a supplementary
budget, including the potential use of the operational
reserve in connection with personnel-related liabilities
resulting from the organizational changes”.

14. The Advisory Committee was informed that the
reorganization would be implemented gradually,
starting early 2002. The Committee was further
informed that this review would not cover UNDP
personnel working on assignment to UNOPS. The
Committee urges the Executive Director of UNOPS
and the Administrator of UNDP to review
expeditiously the question of the future status of the
UNDP personnel working with UNOPS and the
respective liabilities of UNDP and UNOPS. The
Executive Board should be kept informed of the results
of this review, which would be carried out in the
framework of the Memorandum of Understanding of
April 1997.

15. Administrative expenditures for the biennium
2002-2003 are projected at $113 million ($56.5 million
for each year). The $5.4 million increase over the
revised expenditures for 2000-2001 relates to the
projected increase in staff costs to cover salaries and
normal increments, as indicated in paragraph 35 of the
report.

16. The $3.2 million projected excess income over
projected expenditures relating to the administrative
budget will be applied to the replenishment of the
operational reserve. A transfer of $1.6 million for each
year of the biennium to UNOPS operational reserve is
forecast for 2002-2003, thus raising the level of the
available operational reserve from $12 million at the
end of 2001 to $15.2 million at the end of 2003 (see
also paras. 18 and 20 below).

17. The Advisory Committee requests the Executive
Director to present, in the context of the next estimates,
his views on the feasibility and advantages, or
otherwise, of presenting future estimates on a biennial
basis.

Review of the level of the
operational reserve

18. In accordance with Executive Board decision
99/16, the report of the Executive Director includes a
review of the level of the UNOPS operational reserve.
As indicated in paragraph 38, the operational reserve
was established in order to cover shortfalls in income
and uneven cash flows, professional or contractual
liabilities associated with UNOPS services and
liabilities associated with UNOPS personnel contracts
funded from the UNOPS account. The current funding
level is targeted at 4 per cent of the combined
expenditure on administrative and project budgets of
the previous year. The movements on the operational
reserve from the 1998-1999 biennium, including
projections for 2002-2003, are included in table 1 and
summarized in paragraph 40 of the report.

19. The Advisory Committee notes that, following
the recent review of the UNOPS financial situation by
an external financial consulting firm (KPMG), two
issues meriting attention were identified (para. 41 of
DP/2001/28). The first issue refers to the appropriate
level of funding for after-service medical and dental
benefits for retired staff members, which was not
considered in the original definition or calculation of



4
DP/2001/29

the reserve. In this regard, the Committee notes with
satisfaction that UNOPS is currently working with the
United Nations Secretariat and UNDP to establish the
level of these obligations. The Committee also notes
that pending the conclusion and determination of the
impact on the level of funding required for the
operational reserve, the Executive Director is
proposing to fund this type of obligation pertaining to
UNOPS staff, both against the UNOPS Account and
project accounts; this will be done from the existing
reserve, requiring a modification to UNOPS Financial
Regulation 8.3 (a) (iv), as indicated in paragraph 42 of
the report. The Committee recommends acceptance of
this proposal.

20. The second issue relates to the fluctuations in the
level of the operational reserve resulting from the
current single-year basis of the calculation formula.
The Advisory Committee notes that, following a
review of this matter, the resulting proposal is to
replace the existing formula and funding requirements
with a calculation of the reserve level based on a three-
year moving average of expenditure on administrative
and project budgets instead. As indicated in paragraph
44 of the report, the new proposal would therefore take
the 4 per cent average of the project delivery and
administrative expenditures for 1998, 1999 and 2000,
or $567.7 million, and at a rate of 4 per cent, would set
the new operational reserve requirements at $23.1
million instead of $21.1 million under the current
calculation. The Committee notes, as indicated therein,
that while the difference is not large, the new proposal
would produce a more stable and less variable reserve
level that effectively achieves the buffering effect of
the reserve while not requiring modifications to the
current Financial Regulation 8.3. The Committee
concurs with this proposal.

21. Taking into account the comments and
observations made above, the Advisory Committee
recommends that the Executive Board approve the
actions set out in paragraph 46 of the report of the
Executive Director (DP/2001/28).
