Report of the Economic and Social Council

Programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005

Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions
adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its
substantive session of 2004

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on revised estimates resulting from
resolutions and decisions adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its
substantive session of 2004 (A/59/393). During its consideration of the report, the
Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided
additional information.

2. The revised estimates relate to a series of Economic and Social Council
resolutions and decisions outlined in the report of the Secretary-General. The
Committee notes with appreciation that, as it had requested, the report includes a
full costing of the new requirements, broken down into costs that can be met
through existing resources and those that entail additional appropriations.

3. As indicated in paragraph 40 of the report, the implications of resolutions and
decisions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 2004 would give rise
to estimated requirements of $1,537,600, of which $964,000 could be absorbed
within the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. The remaining
requirements of $573,600 for the biennium 2004-2005 would be subject to the
procedures established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 41/213 of
19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987 for the operation of the
contingency fund. The balance remaining in the contingency fund, as indicated in
part XVI of Assembly resolution 58/272 of 23 December 2003, is $11,314,500.

4. The Advisory Committee requested and received information concerning the
current performance for the affected sections of the programme budget. The
information received indicates that, at the present stage, there is under-expenditure.

The Advisory Committee would expect that this situation would lead to an
additional capacity to absorb and intends to take this into account when it considers
the possible appropriation of the amount requested by the Secretary-General.

5. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee take note
of the estimate of $573,600, on the understanding that such appropriations as
may be necessary will be requested by the Secretary-General in the context of a
consolidated statement of programme budget implications and revised
estimates to be submitted to the General Assembly.
