FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER MISSION IN LIBERIA

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary General of 4 September 1996 containing
the revised budget of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)
for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 (A/50/650/Add.4). During its
consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of
the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.

2. UNOMIL was established by the Security Council in its resolution 866 (1993)
of 22 September 1993 for an initial period of seven months. Its mandate has
since then been extended and adjusted by subsequent resolutions of the Council,
the latest being resolution 1071 (1996) of 30 August 1996, which extended the
mandate of the Observer Mission until 30 November 1996.

3. As indicated in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the report of the Secretary-
General, total resources made available to the Observer Mission, from its
inception on 22 September 1993 until 31 March 1996, amount to
$101,512,300 gross. Estimated expenditures total $80,939,000 gross and credits
returned to Member States amount to $20,573,200 gross. Furthermore, $79,134,808
has been assessed on Member States from inception to 31 March 1996,
contributions received amount to $68,212,035 and outstanding assessments were
reduced by $163,022 in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/83 of
15 December 1995. The Advisory Committee was informed during its deliberations
that the shortfall of $10,759,751 indicated in the report had been further
reduced to $10.5 million as at 20 September 1996.

4. The previous report of the Advisory Committee on the financing of UNOMIL,
(A/50/922), was introduced by its Chairman to the Fifth Committee, in the
context of a rapidly changing situation in the area of operations. The General
Assembly therefore requested the Secretary-General to submit revised cost

estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 in its decision 50/482
of 7 June 1996. It also authorized the Secretary-General to utilize the
resources available for the period up to 30 September 1996, should the Security
Council decide to extend the mandate of the Observer Mission beyond 31 May 1996.

5. The revised cost estimates presented in the report of the Secretary-General
(A/50/650/Add.4) were thus formulated on the basis of Security Council
resolution 1071 (1996) and reflect the downward revision in resource
requirements for UNOMIL, in line with the reduction in the operations and
strength of the Observer Mission recommended by the Secretary-General in his
previous report to the Security Council (S/1996/362) of 21 May 1996.

6. In accordance with paragraph 5 of Security Council resolution 1071 (1996)
the Secretary-General is requested to report to the Council by 15 October 1996
with proposals for assistance that UNOMIL or other United Nations agencies could
provide in support of the Liberian peace process, including support for the
election process, disarmament, demobilization and verification of compliance by
the factions. As indicated in paragraphs 15 to 17 of the Secretary-General’s
report, resource requirements for the overall disarmament and demobilization
programme will be presented at a later stage, with the exception of the
deployment of a disarmament adviser to assist the Military Observer Group
(ECOMOG) of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and UNOMIL
with regard to logistics requirements for the preparation for disarmament of the
factions. Plans for humanitarian assistance and resource requirements for the
electoral component of UNOMIL will also be presented in future.

7. Against this background, the Advisory Committee was informed, upon inquiry,
that a technical mission was being dispatched by the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations on 22 September 1996 in order to conduct a survey of the needs and
cost implications for a revised concept of operations, taking into account the
developments taking place in accordance with the new programme of implementation
of the Abuja Agreement, as contained in the final communiqué signed by the Heads
of State and Government of ECOWAS on 17 August 1996 (S/1996/679, annex). The
new programme of implementation provides, inter alia, for the disarmament,
demobilization and repatriation process to take place between 22 November 1996
and 31 January 1997, culminating on elections on 30 May 1997 and the new
Government being sworn in on 15 June 1997. It also provides a mechanism to
ensure strict compliance with the peace plan. It is evident that there will be
no further deployment of staff or provision of additional resources unless the
process moves forward.

8. Under the circumstances, it is the view of the Committee that the revised
estimates presented in the report of the Secretary-General may be revised once
again subject to further decision of the Security Council on the new concept of
operations.

9. The revised estimates presented in the report for the period from 1 January
to 31 June 1996, amount to $14,512,800 gross ($13,630,800 net). This estimate
is $13,102,300 gross lower - a 47 per cent reduction - than the previous cost
estimate of $27,615,800 gross ($25,852,600 net) submitted in the report of the
Secretary-General of 12 March (A/50/650/Add.3), the decrease being due primarily
to the reduction in the strength of the mission and the non-implementation of

the disarmament and demobilization programme. The breakdown of the revised
estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 is presented in
annex I of the Secretary-General’s report (A/50/650/Add.4), along with
supplementary information contained in its annex II.

10. However, the Advisory Committee was informed during its hearings that the
cost of maintaining UNOMIL for the same period had been further reduced to
$14,016,000 gross ($13,186,800 net). This reduction of $496,800 gross
($444,000 net) is due to adjustments to the deployment schedule for military and
civilian personnel. Estimated requirements for military personnel are based on
the deployment of 34 military observers. Therefore, the cost estimate contained
in annex I of the Secretary-General’s report (A/50/650/Add.4), under item 1 (a),
Military observers, subtotal, should now read $1,273,200. The Committee was
informed upon inquiry that, as at 18 September, 10 military observers were on
board.

11. The cost estimates also provide for 43 international civilian staff and 47
local staff, as indicated in paragraph 26 of the Secretary-General’s report,
including a disarmament advisor at the P-4 level who will assist UNOMIL and
ECOMOG to prepare for the disarmament process. The Advisory Committee was also
informed that, as at 18 September, 30 international civilian staff and 38 local
staff had been deployed. Item 2 (A/50/650/Add.4, annex I), Civilian personnel
costs, subheading (b), International and local staff, subtotal, should therefore
now indicate $5,832,000. Item 19, Staff assessment, should consequently be
amended to $829,200, as well as item 20, Income from staff assessment, which
should read $829,200.

12. The updated revisions to the cost estimates for these items mentioned in
paragraphs 10 and 11 above, in addition to a table indicating the planned
deployment dates for additional personnel to UNOMIL, are presented as annexes I
and II to the present report.

13. Of the total revised budget for the period from 1 July 1996 to
30 June 1997, a total of $1,020,100 is estimated for non-recurrent costs. As
indicated in paragraph 23 of the Secretary-General’s report, that amount relates
primarily to the replacement of equipment lost or stolen during the outbreak of
fighting in Monrovia in April and helicopter services for the movement of
personnel and logistics resupply flights during the month of July 1996.

14. The Advisory Committee requested an inventory of the stolen or lost
equipment. However, it was informed that only a preliminary list was available
at the moment. A final version will be presented in the context of the
performance report for the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996, which is due
during the current fifty-first session of the General Assembly. The Committee
also notes that in paragraph 8 of its resolution 1071 (1996), the Security
Council not only condemns the looting of equipment, supplies and personal
property, calling upon the leaders of the factions to ensure the immediate
return of looted property, but also requests the Secretary-General to include in
his report to the Council, quoted in paragraph 6 above, information on how much
of the stolen property has been returned.

15. A breakdown of non-recurrent items is provided in annex II.C of the
Secretary-General’s report. However, the Advisory Committee cautions that the
information provided under current inventory clearly does not reflect the
reality of the situation. Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that many of
the items enumerated in the current inventory column are either missing or not
in usable condition. They have been maintained in the inventory pending
processing by the Property Survey Board. The Committee agrees to the
replacement of those items subject to verification in the current inventory that
those items are unusable.

16. An amount of $807,800 for claims and adjustment is also included under
item 10, Supplies and services. As indicated in paragraph 4 of annex II.D this
amount is to cover the costs of claims arising from the outbreak of fighting in
Monrovia and throughout Liberia, during which UNOMIL personnel suffered losses
of their personal effects during evacuation procedures. Upon inquiry, the
Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 20 September 1996, 161 claims had
been received by UNOMIL for losses suffered by military and civilian personnel.
Total claims, amounting to $807,361, consisted of $537,230 claimed by 93
military observers, $207,150 by 46 international civilian staff and $62,981 by
22 United Nations Volunteers. These claims are yet to be reviewed and finalized
by the local claims review board.

17. The Advisory Committee also inquired regarding the limit for loss or damage
to personal effects attributable to service. In this regard, the Committee was
informed that the guidelines governing the limit of claims for personal losses
are set out in document ST/AI/149/Rev.4 of 14 April 1993. These guidelines
provide for a maximum allowable compensation for claims in respect of any one
incident of $12,000 for a staff member without dependants residing with him or
her at the duty station and $20,000 for a staff member with dependants. These
provisions exclude claims for an automobile and its accessories which are
treated separately.

18. Paragraph 28 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/50/650/Add.4)
outlines the actions that would need to be taken by the General Assembly at its
fifty-first session in connection with the financing of UNOMIL. The Advisory
Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General’s proposal that the
General Assembly appropriate the amount of $12,169,600 gross ($11,838,800 net)
already assessed under the terms of Assembly resolution 50/210 of
23 December 1995. The Advisory Committee also recommends appropriation of
$14,016,000 gross ($13,186,800 net) for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 to
30 June 1997 (see para. 10 above), which is equivalent to a monthly rate of
$1,168,000 gross ($1,098,900 net), subject to the extension of the mandate of
UNOMIL by the Security Council and the decision to be made regarding a revised
concept of operations in line with the new programme of implementation of the
Abuja Agreement. It is evident, in this case, that the Secretary-General will
submit revised cost estimates to the General Assembly to include resource
requirements for the overall disarmament and demobilization programme,
humanitarian assistance and electoral component of the Observer Mission.
