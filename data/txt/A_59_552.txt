Review of the structure and functions of all liaison offices or
representation in New York of organizations headquartered
elsewhere funded from the regular budget

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the review of the structure and
functions of all liaison offices or representation in New York of organizations
headquartered elsewhere funded from the regular budget (A/59/395). During its
consideration of the matter, the Committee met with representatives of the
Secretary-General.

2. The report was prepared pursuant to paragraph 47 of General Assembly
resolution 58/270 of 23 December 2003. It includes a description of the functions
and the level of staff resources of liaison offices and representation in New York
funded from the regular budget. Paragraph 2 of document A/59/395 includes a list
of these offices. Upon request, the Committee was provided with information on all
the posts and level of staff of these offices, including those funded from
extrabudgetary resources, as follows:

3. Paragraphs 4 to 21 of the report discuss the representational and substantive
contributions to the work programme of the parent offices. The Advisory Committee
notes that, in some instances (e.g., the United Nations Centre for Human
Settlements (UN-Habitat)), the description of these activities is very limited and
would appear not to be concomitant with the number and level of staff resources
available to the offices. The Committee was provided upon request with a detailed
description of the substantive responsibilities of the New York office of the
UN-Habitat.

4. The Advisory Committee requested information on measures taken to improve
the effectiveness of the liaison offices and representation in New York. The
Committee was informed that these offices were operating with the benefit of
current information and communication technologies available at Headquarters.

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that representational activities of the
liaison offices in New York described in the report could be broadly categorized in
three main areas: (a) participation in meetings at the intergovernmental level; (b)
participation in internal consultations, interdepartmental meetings within the
Secretariat and inter-agency meetings; and (c) outreach activities in developing and
maintaining contacts with United Nations-affiliated non-governmental
organizations, foundations, private-sector organizations and academic institutions.

6. The Advisory Committee requested information on travel to New York of staff
of organizations headquartered elsewhere with liaison offices or representation in
New York. Information was provided on expenditure and the number of staff
relating to official travel to New York in the biennium 2002-2003 (see annex to the
present report). It was indicated that these trips were often combined with travel for
other purposes and visits to other destinations. In the case of the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), it was

A/59/552

indicated that travel to New York was limited to five trips of the Commissioner-
General accompanied by one or two senior staff. Those trips related to the
presentation to the Advisory Committee of the biennial budget of UNRWA, the
presentation to the General Assembly of the annual report and the annual pledging
conference.

7. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly take
note of the report of the Secretary-General. The Committee intends to revert to
the issue and examine the functions and level of staff resources of the liaison offices
in New York in the context of its examination of the proposed programme budget
for the biennium 2006-2007.
