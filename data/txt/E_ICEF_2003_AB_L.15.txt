United Nations Children’s Fund biennial support budget for
2004-2005 and supplementary support budget for 2002-2003

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the reports of the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) on the biennial support budget for 2004-2005
(E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14) and supplementary support budget for 2002-2003
(E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.13). During its consideration of the item, the Committee met
with representatives of the Executive Director, who provided additional information.

Format and presentation
2. The Advisory Committee notes the improvements made in the overall
presentation of the budget document in response to its prior recommendations (see
E/ICEF/2001/AB/L.11, paras. 2-3). The Committee recalls that it recommended that
information be provided on progress in developing better tools for measuring
performance and expected results for which the UNICEF administration would be
held accountable (E/ICEF/2001/AB/L.11, para. 4). The Committee exchanged views
with the Executive Director on the programme implementation and results achieved
in 2002 (E/ICEF/2002/4 (Part II)). The Committee notes the progress on reporting
on the basis of results achieved in 2002 through the development of a set of baseline
indicators against which progress can be measured. The Committee was informed
that further to this, UNICEF has provided detailed guidance and learning materials
in 2003 to staff on results-oriented programme planning and management. Annual
reporting on results and key management indicators is being systematized through

* E/ICEF/2003/14.

E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.15

the country office annual reports. Progress on the subject will be reported in the next
biennial budget proposal.

3. The Advisory Committee trusts that further improvements will be made with
regard to programme performance measurement and in the presentation of indicators
of achievement. In the Committee’s opinion, the results-based presentation of
UNICEF programmes should be more specific, making clear to what extent key
results achieved contributed to the attainment of the objectives and expected
accomplishments, such as the priorities indicated in the UNICEF medium-term
strategic plan.

4. The Committee is aware that the implementation of results-based budgeting is
in its early stages at UNICEF, as in other organizations of the United Nations
system, and that refinements will be introduced as further experience is gained in
performance measurement and application of results-based management
methodologies. In this connection, the Committee recommends that UNICEF
maintain close collaboration with other funds and programmes that have introduced
results-based management systems (see, for example, document DP/2003/28, paras.
22-23), with the objective of using common terminology (see also para. 18 below).
Terminology used by UNICEF should be included in future budget presentation in
the annex on definitions.

5. The organization chart of UNICEF in document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14 shows
major organizational units at headquarters and in the field for 2004-2005. The
Committee requests that in the future, at the time of its examination of the estimates,
it should be provided with an organizational chart that includes the number of posts
in each unit at headquarters.

Resources
6. The Advisory Committee notes the positive income projections for UNICEF
for the biennium 2004-2005. As shown in table 1 of document
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, for the biennium 2004-2005 total projected resources
(including an opening balance of $707 million) would amount to $4,082.1 million,
an increase of 21.8 per cent, as compared with total planned resources of $3,351.8
million for the biennium 2002-2003.  For 2004-2005, total regular resources are
projected at $1,584.2 million, a 26-per-cent increase, as compared with planned total
regular resources of $1,257.2 million for 2002-2003. Other resources are projected
at $2,209.0 million for 2004-2005, as compared with other resources of $1,607.0
million for 2002-2003, or 37.5 per cent higher, and total trust funds are projected at
$288.9 million, as compared with trust funds of $487.6 million, showing a decrease
of 40.7 per cent, for 2002-2003.

7. The Advisory Committee was informed that income from the private sector,
projected at $901 million for 2004-2005 ($480 million for 2004 and $421 million for
2005), as compared with $805.0 million for 2002-2003 (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14,
table 1 and annex IV), would be revised upwards to $1,040 million ($536 million for
2004 and $504 million for 2005).

8. Table 2 of the budget document shows the revised resource projections for
2002-2003, as compared with the resources initially planned for 2002-2003. Regular
resources would increase 15 per cent, from $1,173.0 million planned for 2002-2003
(adjusted by excluding the opening balance of $100.0 million and adding the



3
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.15

adjustment for taxes of $15.8 million, as indicated in the footnote to table 2) to a
revised projection of $1,349 million. Other resources (excluding trust funds) would
increase 23.0 per cent, from $1,220 million planned for 2002-2003 to a revised
projection of $1,505 million.

II. Biennial support budget estimates for 2004-2005

9. For 2004-2005, the biennial budget estimates funded under regular resources
amount to $684.9 million gross ($528.5 million net), as compared to $566.2 million
gross ($477.9 million net) for 2002-2003 (E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, table 1). The
gross proposed budget for 2004-2005 shows an increase of $118.7 million,
comprising a volume increase of $45.0 million and a cost increase of $73.7 million.
Main areas of increase/decrease are discussed in the summary of the proposals in
paragraphs 34-37 and reflected in table 3 of the budget document.

10. Estimated income and adjustments to the 2004-2005 biennial support budget
amount to $156.4 million (including $129.6 million from recovery charges), as
compared to estimated income to the 2002-2003 biennial support budget of $88.3
million  (including income from recovery charges of $61.5 million). Recovery
charges are to cover the costs for programme support and management and
administration. The methodology upon which the recovery charges are currently
based is discussed briefly in paragraph 5 and recapped in annex VI to document
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14. The Committee notes that an average recovery rate of 8 per
cent is used to estimate the other resources recovery income. The Committee was
informed that the revised recovery policy approved by the Executive Board in
decision 2003/9 would be reviewed at the end of the biennium 2004-2005.

11. The total number of posts proposed under the support budget for 2004-2005 is
2,717 (930 international Professionals, 258 national Professionals and 1,529 General
Service and other categories of staff), as compared with the authorized staffing for
2002-2003 of 2,523 posts (859 international Professionals, 243 national
Professionals and 1,421 General Service and other categories of staff). Thus, for
2004-2005, the number of posts under the support budget would increase by 194
posts (71 international Professionals, 15 national Professional and 108 General
Service and other categories of staff). The Committee notes that the additional posts
include conversions from temporary assistance and from programme funds to
established posts in the support budget (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, paras. 22, 39,
table 6 and summary table IV). The Committee was provided with detailed
information on post changes in the field and at headquarters. The Committee
observes that the largest increases in posts for 2004-2005 under all sources of funds
are for new international Professionals at the P-5 and P-4 levels (23 and 20
additional posts, respectively), while at the P-3, P-2/1 and national Professional
levels the increases are comparatively lower (7, 14 and 13 additional posts,
respectively) (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, summary table V). In the view of the
Committee, there is a need to strengthen the UNICEF programme for young
international Professionals and increase their recruitment. The Committee also
recommends further cooperation and sharing of experiences in this regard with other
funds and programmes that have established similar young professional programmes
(see, for example, document DP/2001/24, para. 27).

E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.15

12. Summary table IV of the budget document shows the total post
reclassifications (net) proposed for 2004-2005. As indicated in paragraph 39 of
document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, for the current biennium, the Executive Director
has made changes in post levels up to the P-5 level with necessary offsets within the
total appropriation, as per authority delegated by the Executive Board. The Advisory
Committee was provided with information on the proposed upgrades to the D-1 and
D-2 level at headquarters and in the field. For headquarters, the Executive Director
proposes the reclassification of the posts of Director and Chief of Staff of the Office
of the Executive Director and of the posts of Director, Office of Public Partnership
from the P-5 to the D-1 level; for the field, the proposals include the post
reclassification of the Representatives in Afghanistan and in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo from the D-1 to the D-2 level and the reclassification of the
Representatives in Iraq, Niger, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and South Africa
from the P-5 to the D-1 level. The Advisory Committee has expressed concern in the
past about proposals for upward reclassification of post of funds and programmes of
the United Nations, particularly to the D-1 and D-2 levels, stating that they must be
as the result of significant changes in the level and scope of responsibility of the
posts. The Committee recommends that the Executive Board should bear this in
mind during its review of the UNICEF proposals for upward reclassifications of
posts to the D-1 and D-2 levels at headquarters and in the field.

Security and emergency preparedness
13. For the biennium 2004-2005, the UNICEF biennial support budget includes a
volume increase of $14.0 million ($8.1 million for the field operations and $5.9
million at headquarters) for security and emergency preparedness (see
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, paras. 12-17 and table 3, item III.1 (a)). UNICEF
participates in cost-sharing for the Office of the United Nations Security
Coordinator (UNSECOORD). An increase of $3.0 million in cost-sharing to $9.7
million has been included. The Committee notes that UNICEF emergency operations
centre, which has been partially staffed by temporary assistance funded from other
resources, would be funded from the support budget in 2004-2005. A provision of
$0.9 million has been included under the support budget for this purpose. Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that UNICEF emergency operations centre
would continued to function as a back-up support for the operations centre of the
United Nations Secretariat.

14. The Executive Director is exceptionally requesting that the Executive Board
grant her the authority to spend up to $14 million in additional funding for security-
related emergencies, if needed, after first utilizing the provision for security and
emergency preparedness under the support budget (E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, para.
18). The Committee notes that additional security-related requirements may arise in
connection with various security-related costs, such as emergency movement of
personnel and offices, blast mitigation and preventive measures to diminish possible
acts of terrorism, additional field security officers and security guards and
strengthening of premises access. UNICEF plans to continue to work closely with
UNSECOORD to assess and review these requirements. The Committee endorses
the request of the Executive Director.

E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.15

United Nations reform and programme results
15. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 19 of the budget document that
UNICEF continues to participate with other funds and programmes of the United
Nations in the inter-agency simplification and harmonization exercise coordinated
by the United Nations Development Group. For the initiatives discussed in
paragraphs 19-23 of document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.24, under the heading “United
Nations reform and programme results”, the Executive Director requests a total of
$14.8 million ($13.4 million for the field and $1.4 million for headquarters)
(E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, para. 24 and table 3). Upon request, the Committee was
provided with a summary of progress in the harmonization of programming
processes (see annex I to this report).

Training
16. For the learning/training activities mentioned in paragraph 26 of the budget
document, the Executive Director proposes an allocation of $7.0 million ($4.16
million for the field and $2.84 million for headquarters), reflecting an increase of
$1.0 million, as compared with the training budget approved for the current
biennium of $6.0 million. The Committee notes that the learning/training priorities
would focus on functional/substantive areas, and on those that would be used or
developed to support them, as well as the career development of staff. Upon request,
the Committee was provided with a cost breakdown of the proposed training budget
for 2004-2005 (see annex II to this report).

Information technology
17. The Executive Director’s proposals for information technology (IT)
requirements for 2004-2005 are addressed in paragraphs 76-79 of the budget
document. The estimated distribution of IT  requirements for 2004-2005 amounts to
$71.6 million, as compared with $50.0 million for the current biennium, or 43.2 per
cent higher. Recurrent costs would amount to $49.9 million and include only cost
increases and maintenance of investment projects approved for 2002-2003. In
addition, a one-time investment of $19.4 million is proposed for 2004-2005 for
development of major systems (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, tables 7 and 8).

18. The Advisory Committee notes the information provided on UNICEF major
systems for headquarters and field offices (E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.14, paras. 30-33).
The Committee was provided with a summary of main IT activities completed in
2002-2003 and planned for 2004-2005 and beyond (see annex III to this report). The
Committee is not convinced that these systems would provide the IT support needed
for the development of a result-based management framework at UNICEF.
Moreover, the Committee is concerned with the rapid escalation of IT costs at
UNICEF, projected at $71.6 million for 2004-2005, as compared with IT budgets of
other United Nations funds and programmes (see, for example, document
DP/2003/29, para. 18). The Committee is aware that other funds and programmes
have been cooperating in joint implementation of enterprise resource planning
(ERP) systems in support of the organizations’ results-based management
frameworks. The roll-out of ERP systems is providing opportunities to these
organizations for deepening collaboration and harmonization, while economies have
been realized by splitting costs among the participants based on projected usage and
each organization’s staff and support budget amounts (see, for example, document



6
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.15

DP/2003/28, paras. 97, 127 and 134). The Committee recommends that UNICEF
explore further areas of IT collaboration with other funds and programmes,
particularly in IT systems geared to supporting  results-based management
frameworks.

III. Supplementary support budget for 2002-2003

19. The Executive Director recommends that the Executive Board approve a
supplementary budget appropriation of $8.0 million to cover salary increases and
additional requirements in security for 2002-2003. Paragraphs 1-3 of document
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.13 explain in some detail the reasons for these increases.

20. In decision 2001/13 (E/ICEF/2001/6), the Executive Board approved a support
budget of $566,169,000 gross ($477,869,000 net), with the estimated income to the
budget of $88,300,000. The increased expenditures from other resources in 2002 has
brought about an increased recovery income for the support budget of $2.9 million;
moreover, due to the revised recovery policy (see para. 10 above), UNICEF expects
to realized a further increase of recovery income of $5.1 million in 2003. The
estimated increase of income to the support budget, totalling $8.0 million for 2002-
2003, would offset the increase of $8.0 million requested by the Executive Director
for the support budget for 2002-2003 (E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.13, para. 4).

21. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Executive Board approve the
request of the Executive Director.
