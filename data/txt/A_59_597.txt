Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and

at its substantive and resumed sessions of 2004

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the following statements of programme budget implications, submitted
by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of
the General Assembly, of the following: draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.49, on the
situation of human rights in Myanmar (A/C.5/59/19); proposal of the Chairman of
the Sixth Committee at its 27th meeting, on 19 November 2004, related to the
International convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings
(A/C.5/59/20); draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.31, on the International Convention on
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families
(A/C.5/59/21); draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1, on the rights of the child
(A/C.5/59/22). The Committee also considered the report of the Secretary-General
on revised estimates relating to activities in the area of international cooperation in
tax matters, resulting from resolution 2004/69, which was adopted by the Economic
and Social Council at its resumed substantive session of 2004 (A/59/393/Add.1).

2. The implementation of the above-mentioned decisions, if adopted by the
General Assembly, would, as indicated below, entail in some cases additional
appropriations for the biennium 2004-2005, which would be considered by the
General Assembly in accordance with the procedures set out in General Assembly
resolutions 41/213 and 42/211 of 19 December 1986 and 21 December 1987,
respectively, for the use and operation of the contingency fund.

Situation of human rights in Myanmar

Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.49

3. As indicated in paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General’s statement
(A/C.5/59/19), under the terms of operative paragraph 4 of draft resolution
A/C.3/59/L.49, the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to
continue to provide his good offices and to pursue his discussions on the situation of
human rights and the restoration of democracy with the Government and the people
of Myanmar; to give necessary assistance to enable his Special Envoy for Myanmar,
as well as to the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the
situation of human rights in Myanmar, to discharge their mandates fully and
effectively; and to report to the Assembly at its sixtieth session and to the
Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session on the progress made on the
implementation of the resolution.

4. The activities related to the implementation of the requests are described in
paragraphs 4 and 5 of the statement. Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 contain information on
the estimated resource requirements. In this connection, the Committee notes that
the Secretary-General estimates that the costs of continuing the good offices efforts
through his Special Envoy for Myanmar, for a one-year period (1 January to
31 December 2005), amount to $294,900 gross ($252,400 net). The resource



3
A/59/597

requirements are also presented in the consolidated presentation of the Secretary-
General on estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other
initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council (see
A/59/534/Add.1).

5. The breakdown of the costs is provided in the annex to the Secretary-General’s
statement (A/C.5/59/19). Resources include the provision of salaries for the Special
Envoy, at the rate applicable on a when-actually-employed basis, and that of a
General Service (Local level) to provide support to the Special Envoy as and when
required ($102,600). It also includes provision for travel of the Special Envoy
($95,600), the services of a consultant ($48,500) and miscellaneous services in
support of the Mission ($5,700).

6. The Committee notes from paragraph 6 of the statement that an unencumbered
balance of $6,200 is expected to remain out of the appropriation for 2004. Taking
this balance into account, the overall requirements for 2005 would therefore amount
to $288,700 gross ($246,200 net).

7. The request in paragraph 4 (b) of the draft resolution regarding assistance to
the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights does not require
additional resources, since provision for this type of activities, considered to be of a
perennial nature, are already included under section 24, Human rights (see para. 8 of
the Secretary-General’s note).

8. Taking into account paragraph 6 above, and bearing in mind what is
stated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the statement of the Secretary-General, the
Fifth Committee may wish to inform the General Assembly that, should it
adopt draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.49, a total of up to $288,700 gross ($246,200
net) would be required for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2005 for
the continuation of the good offices of the Secretary-General relating to the
situation in Myanmar.

International convention against the reproductive cloning of
human beings

Programme budget implications arising from the decision of the Sixth Committee
at its 27th meeting, on 19 November 2004

9. As indicated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Secretary-General’s statement
(A/C.5/59/20), at the 27th meeting, the Chairman of the Sixth Committee made a
statement proposing the establishment of a working group to finalize the text of a
United Nations declaration on human cloning, on the basis of draft resolution
A/C.6/59/L.26, and to report to the Sixth Committee during the current session. At
the same meeting, the Secretary of the Committee made a statement regarding the
administrative and budgetary implications of the proposal (see A/C.6/59/SR.27) and
the Committee decided, without a vote, to establish a working group.

10. The activities related to the implementation of the request contained in the
proposal of the Chairman of the Sixth Committee are indicated in paragraph 5 of the
Secretary-General’s statement. The Committee notes that the decision entails five
meetings of the Working Group and one formal meeting of the Sixth Committee in
February 2005. As indicated in paragraphs 7 and 8, the conference-servicing
requirements related to the meetings of the working group, estimated at $128,600 (at



4
A/59/597

2004-2005 rates), would not require additional resources, since it is understood that
the meetings would be held in lieu of the 10 meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee
already programmed in the calendar of conferences. The conference-servicing
requirements at full cost for a formal meeting of the Sixth Committee, to be held on
18 February 2005, entail an amount of $37,500 (at 2004-2005 rates), as indicated in
paragraph 6 of the statement. The Advisory Committee requested clarification and
was informed that the formal meeting would constitute an “addition”. However, the
Committee points out that it should be possible to accommodate the meeting from
within existing conference-servicing resources, in view of the reduction in the
overall number of meetings foreseen.

11. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform
the General Assembly that the implications of the proposals contained in the
decision of the Sixth Committee at its 27th meeting, on 19 November 2004
would not entail additional requirements for the five-day session of the working
group in February 2005. Bearing in mind what is stated in paragraph 9 above,
the requirements related to the formal meeting of the Sixth Committee
anticipated for 18 February 2005 ($37,500) need not be appropriated at this
time; instead, such requirement, if any, should be reflected in the second
performance report for the biennium 2004-2005.

International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families

Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.31

12. As indicated in paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General’s statement
(A/C.5/59/21), under the terms of operative paragraph 3 of draft resolution
A/C.3/59/L.31, the General Assembly would welcome the establishment of the
Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of
Their Families, as well as the report of its first session, which was held from 1 to
5 March 2003, and take note of the rules of procedure adopted by the Committee.

13. The Committee notes that the above-mentioned Committee, in its report,1

decided to request the Secretary-General to arrange two sessions in July and
October 2005, of one week duration each. These sessions would replace an initially
programmed session of three weeks for 2005 (see para. 3 of the statement). As
indicated in paragraph 6 of the statement, the full cost of the activities envisaged in
this decision amount to $891,300 in the biennium 2004-2005, compared to the
amount of $1,120,400 currently approved for the programmed three-week session.
The proposed arrangements would therefore result in additional requirements for
travel of Committee members ($12,000), which, as indicated in paragraph 6 (a), can
be absorbed within overall resources currently included under section 24, Human
rights; and estimated savings of $238,100 and $3,200 under section 2, General
Assembly affairs and conference services and section 29E, Administration, Geneva,
respectively, of the programme budget for the current biennium.

14. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform
the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.31, as
orally amended, it would not give rise to additional requirements under the
programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. Moreover, the actual savings
resulting from the reduction in conference-servicing requirements will be

A/59/597

reported to the General Assembly in the context of the second performance
report for the biennium 2004-2005.

Rights of the Child

Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1

15. The Secretary-General’s statement (A/C.5/59/22) contains the programme
budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1, adopted by the Third
Committee at its 52nd meeting, on 23 November 2004. The Committee notes that
the draft resolution has programme budget implications which relate to the
Committee on the Rights of the Child (see A/C.5/59/22, sect. I) and to the Office of
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed
Conflict (ibid., sect. II).

16. With regard to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee notes
that, under the terms of paragraph 9 of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1, the
General Assembly would welcome the efforts of the Committee on the Rights of the
Child to reform its working methods so as to consider the reports of States parties in
a timely manner, including by the proposal to work in two chambers, as an
exceptional and temporary measure, for a period of two years, in order to clear the
backlog of reports, taking due account of equitable geographic distribution, and
would urge the Committee to continue to review its working methods in order to
enhance its efficiency and to assess progress after two years, also taking into
account the wider context of treaty body reform.

17. The Committee notes that the bicameral work would increase the number of
reports of States parties to be examined from 27 to 48 per year, as indicated in
paragraph 3 of the statement. However, the Committee was informed that it is not
expected that the backlog will be cleared up completely. The Committee therefore
stresses the importance of pursuing additional avenues in the context of the
treaty body reform.

18. Paragraph 8 of the statement contains a breakdown of the additional resource
requirements related to the request contained in paragraph 9 of draft resolution
A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1. The Committee notes that the additional regular budget
requirements for 2005 amount to $702,200, which would require additional
appropriations by the General Assembly. As to the costs for 2006, indicated at
$4,115,200, as indicated in paragraph 9 of the Secretary-General’s statement, these
would be included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007.
In connection with the latter, the Advisory Committee requested a breakdown of the
conference-servicing requirements of $3,878,700 for 2006, which is attached as an
annex below.

19. Under the terms of paragraph 51 (d) of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1,
the General Assembly would decide to invite the Chairman of the Committee on the
Rights of the Child to present an oral report on the work of the Committee to the
General Assembly at its sixtieth session. This would be funded by extrabudgetary
resources, as indicated in paragraph 10 of the Secretary-General’s statement.

20. With regard to the programme budget implications related to the Office of the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict,
the Committee notes that, under the terms of operative paragraph 51 (c) of draft



6
A/59/597

resolution A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1, the General Assembly would decide to request the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict to
continue to submit reports to the General Assembly and the Commission on Human
Rights.

21. Paragraphs 12 to 17 of the statement provide the background of the Office of
the Special Representative. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General
Assembly, in its resolution 51/77 of 12 December 1996, recommended that the
Secretary-General appoint a Special Representative on the impact of armed conflict
on children for a period of three years, and that a Special Representative was
appointed in September 1997. The mandate of the Special Representative was
extended by the General Assembly for subsequent three-year periods in its
resolutions 54/149 and 57/190 of 17 December 1999 and 18 December 2002,
respectively. In the latter resolution, the Assembly also requested a comprehensive
assessment of the scope and effectiveness of the system’s response, including
recommendations for strengthening, mainstreaming, integrating and sustaining those
activities.

22. Since its inception, the Office of the Special Representative has been funded
through voluntary contributions. The Committee further recalls that the General
Assembly, in its resolution 58/245 of 23 December 2003, decided that the activities
under the mandate of that Office would be supported through regular budget
funding. The Fifth Committee, having considered the Secretary-General’s statement
of programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.28, informed the
General Assembly before the adoption of the resolution that, should it adopt the
draft resolution, any appropriations would be considered in the context of the report
requested in resolution 57/190 (see para. 21 above). The report of the Secretary-
General entitled “Comprehensive assessment of the United Nations response to
children affected by armed conflict” was issued on 3 September 2004 (see
A/59/331).

23. The Committee notes from paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Secretary-General’s
statement (A/C.5/59/22) that it is not expected that sufficient extrabudgetary
resources will be available to maintain the Office of the Special Representative
beyond 31 December 2004. The balance of extrabudgetary resources for children
and armed conflict activities is estimated to amount to $690,000 at the end of 2004,
of which $150,000 are unearmarked. It is further indicated therein that “it is not
possible at this stage to provide a definite estimate of voluntary contributions for
2005”, but it could be determined, however, that the Office would not have
sufficient extrabudgetary resources to operate through 2005.

24. As indicated in paragraph 20 of the Secretary-General’s statement, the
reporting requested to the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights
in paragraph 51 (c) of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1 has been the
responsibility of the Office of the Special Representative during the past six years,
and support is required to carry out this mandate for one more year, in view of the
extension mentioned in paragraph 21 above.

25. The Committee notes from paragraph 21 and table 2 of the statement that the
annual cost of the activities of the Office of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict is estimated at $950,000 net of
staff assessment. The staffing costs, which amount to $750,000 provide for a
streamlined structure, as indicated in the comprehensive assessment report



7
A/59/597

(A/59/331, para. 50), which includes a total of eight temporary posts (1 USG, 1 P-5,
2 P-4, 1 P-3 and 3 General Service), described in paragraph 21 of the statement,
compared to a previous total of 12 posts. The balance of the resources ($200,000),
covering travel, consultancies and other office operations indicated in table 2, are
based on related costs since 2002.

26. The Committee notes that the balance of unearmarked extrabudgetary
resources of $150,000 would cover some of the operational requirements, but in
order to maintain the Office until the end of December 2005, an additional provision
of $800,000 net would be required to be funded from the regular budget for the
biennium 2004-2005, under section 1, Overall policy-making, direction and
coordination. In addition, an amount of $120,000 would be required under section
34, Staff assessment, to be offset by the same amount under income from staff
assessment.

27. As indicated in paragraph 22 of the statement, any possibility for reducing the
proposed regular budget financing for 2005 could only be defined at a later stage,
when further information of additional extrabudgetary resources becomes available.
In addition, the Committee notes that, subject to the review of the mandate of the
Special Representative during the General Assembly’s sixtieth session, the funding
of the Office beyond 2005 would be contingent upon availability of voluntary
contributions.

28. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform
the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution
A/C.3/59/L.29/Rev.1, additional requirements of $1,622,200 gross ($1,502,000
net) would arise under the programme budget for 2004-2005, as broken down
in the table in paragraph 26 of the Secretary-General’s statement. The
additional appropriations would be considered by the General Assembly in
accordance with the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency
fund mentioned in paragraph 2 above. The requirements of $4,115,200 for 2006,
mentioned in paragraph 17 above, in connection with the work of the
Committee on the Rights of the Child, would be included in the proposed
programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007.

Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted
by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive and resumed
sessions of 2004

29. The Advisory Committee was informed that, following the adoption of
Economic and Social Council resolution 2004/69, the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on
International Cooperation in Tax Matters had been renamed the Committee of
Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters. Starting in 2005, the
Committee will hold yearly meetings, whereas the Ad Hoc Group used to meet on a
biennial basis.

30. As indicated in the revised estimates submitted (A/59/393/Add.1), the
expenditure requirements arising as a result of the adoption of resolution 2004/69,
estimated at full cost of $294,900 for 2005, can be absorbed within resources
approved for the biennium 2004-2005 under section 2, General Assembly affairs
and conference services ($126,100), section 9, Economic and social affairs



8
A/59/597

($165,900) and section 29E, Administration, Geneva ($2,900). The related
requirements for the biennium 2006-2007 and beyond are estimated at $589,800 per
biennium. These requirements would be included in the proposed programme
budgets for the biennium 2006-2007 and subsequent bienniums (para. 8,
A/59/393/Add.1).

31. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-
General’s proposals.
