20 - 24 September 2004, New York
Item 7 of the provisional agenda
Financial, Budgetary and Administrative Matters

UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND

ADDITIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS TO SAFEGUARD
UNFPA PERSONNEL AND PREMISES GLOBALLY

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the
report of the Executive Director on the additional security requirements to safeguard UNFPA
personnel and premises globally (DP/FPA/2004/14).  During its consideration of the report the
Advisory Committee met with the Deputy Executive Director (Management) and her colleagues,
who provided additional information.

2. The Committee notes that approved resources in the biennial support budget for 2004-
2005 for this purpose amount to $4.6 million (see table 1 of the report).  The Executive Director
indicates that additional protective measures to address the deterioration of the security
framework and ensure that the organization has the capacity to effectively respond to the
demands of the rapidly changing global environment with minimal interruption of its operations
would require additional resources estimated to amount to $6.8 million (paragraph 1 and table 1).
The measures envisaged are enumerated in paragraph 2 of the report.

3.  Further to the information provided in table 1, the Advisory Committee, upon enquiry,
was provided with a detailed breakdown of the requirements proposed:

The Committee points out that the foregoing information was not accompanied by further detail
or by any analysis of how these projected allocations were arrived at.

4. The Advisory Committee was also informed that during the last 12 months eight  country
offices had been relocated for safety and/or security reasons (in Cambodia, Central African
Republic, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Philippines, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen) and five
more will be relocated during this biennium (in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Guinea, Jordan and Syrian
Arab Republic).

5. The Committee notes that the Executive Director’s request for additional resources
amounts to approximately 4 per cent of the approved gross 2004-2005 regular biennial support
budget.  The amount would be treated as a reserve and recorded as such in the financial
statements.

6. The Advisory Committee recognizes the importance and the urgency of strengthening the
security and safety of United Nations operations, staff and premises.  However, in its report on
the subject (A/58/758), the Committee indicated that resource requests for such purpose should
not be based on a piecemeal approach but preceded by a comprehensive and complete review of
security arrangements.  In addition, the Committee indicated the need for an integrated and
coordinated approach by all organizations of the United Nations system and requested the
Secretary-General to aim, in his report to be submitted early in the fifty-ninth session, at the
establishment of a unified standard in terms of the level of security. The General Assembly
endorsed these recommendations in its resolution 58/295 of 18 June 2004 and in paragraph 6 of
the resolution enumerated the elements to be contained in the comprehensive report.

7. The Advisory Committee endorses the measures indicated in (a) through (d) of paragraph
2 of the report and takes note of UNFPA’s timely efforts in this regard.  It trusts that they will be
integrated in an overall United Nations comprehensive plan.   However, bearing in mind the
considerations referred to in paragraph 6 above, the Committee is of the opinion that action on
the recruitment of the three field-based regional security advisers and one member of support
staff at headquarters (paragraph 2 (e)) should await the submission of the Secretary-General’s
comprehensive report and such decision as the General Assembly may take thereon.

8. Subject to what has been stated in paragraph 7 above, the Advisory Committee
recommends that the Executive Board endorse the proposal of the Executive Director to grant
her exceptional authority during 2004-2005 to access up to 4 per cent of the approved gross
2004-2005 regular biennial support budget of $169.6 million, as additional funding for security
measures amounting to a maximum of $6.8 million.  The amount should be utilized only for the
purposes intended; it should be recorded as a reserve, disclosed in the financial statements and
reported to the Executive Board in the annual financial review.
