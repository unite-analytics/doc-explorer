Financial situation of the International Research and
Training Institute for the Advancement of Women

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financial situation of the
International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women
(A/58/426). The report was submitted in response to General Assembly resolution
57/311 of 18 June 2003, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to
report further at its fifty-eighth session on the financial situation of the United
Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of
Women (INSTRAW).

2. As indicated in the report, the level of expenditures realized for the period
from 1 January to 30 September 2003 was lower than expected. This was due mainly
to the fact that no Director of the Institute had yet been appointed and the resulting
low level of activity (A/58/426, para. 7).

3. The Secretary-General indicated that currently available resources would allow
continuation of operations of the Institute to the end of May 2004, albeit at a
suboptimal level. In response to questions, representatives of the Secretary-General
informed the Advisory Committee that they were not in a position to provide
information on whether further funds were forthcoming.

4. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly take
note of the report of the Secretary-General. The Committee understands that
the matter of INSTRAW is currently before the Third Committee. Should
developments in that Committee result in the submission by the Secretary-
General of a statement of programme budget implications, the Advisory
Committee would revert to the matter at that time.
