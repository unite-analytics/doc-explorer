6. In paragraph 7 and annex I to the report, it is indicated
that the total resources provided to MINURSO by the General
Assembly, in its resolutions 51/2 B of 13 June 1997 and
52/228 A of 31 March 1998, for the period from 1 July 1997
to 30 June 1998 amount to $47,402,100 gross ($44,419,700
net). This includes the amount of $1,122,000 for the support 10. It is indicated in paragraph 16 of the performance report

— approximately 14 per cent of the amount appropriated. unencumbered balance of $6,523,200 gross ($5,357,200 net)
7. The Advisory Committee notes that the unencumbered
balance resulted, in large part, from the delayed deployment
of contingent personnel, as well as initial delays in the
deployment of civilian personnel. In this connection, the
Advisory Committee notes that savings of $1,037,600, out
of an apportioned amount of $9,917,700, are reported under
military personnel costs, and that savings of $5,168,600, out
of an apportioned amount of $20,882,700, are reported under
civilian personnel costs. Moreover, although related costs for
international salaries and common staff costs were calculated
on the basis of 50 per cent of staff on appointments of limited
duration, mission appointees ranged from 75 to 80 per cent
of the total, contributing to additional savings under civilian
personnel costs.
8. However, these savings were partially offset by an
overexpenditure of $242,300 under operational costs. In
particular, under premises and accommodations, an
expenditure of $430,600 over the apportioned amount of
$1,128,900, was reported. In this regard, the Advisory
Committee recalls that the Secretary-General, in his report
of 20 February 1998 had indicated a provision of $40,000,
under construction/prefabricated buildings, for the
construction of two base camps (A/52/730/Add.2, annex II.C,
para. 4). Although the Advisory Committee notes that savings
were achieved from lower rental rates for premises in
Laayoune, the non-rental of 30 apartments originally required
for the identification process and lower requirements under
alterations to premises, maintenance supplies and services
and utilities, this was more than offset by additional
requirements of $635,800 for the extensive renovation of a
logistics complex in Laayoune used as residential and office
accommodations for the engineering support and demining
contingent personnel, thus resulting in the net additional
requirement of $430,600 under premises/accommodations.
 

9. The Advisory Committee was informed that the Mission
had expected a voluntary contribution for the engineering and

for the period from 1 July to 30 June 1998. The Advisory
Committee recommends that Member States be credited their
respective shares of the unencumbered balance for the period
in question in a manner to be determined by the Assembly.

Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 1999
to 30 June 2000

11. The proposed budget of MINURSO for the period from
1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, contained in the report of the
Secretary-General of 11 February 1999 (A/53/820), amounts
to $49,023,000 gross ($45,071,400 net). The proposed
budget contains the operational requirements of MINURSO
at the maintenance level, including the identification process
(see para. 20 and 21 below). As indicated in paragraph 22 of
the report, the proposed requirements represent a decrease
of $9,643,300 in gross terms — or 16.4 per cent — when
compared to the previous 12-month period. The Advisory
Committee further notes that the proposed budget takes into
account the maintenance requirements at the strength
authorized by the Security Council in its resolution
1133 (1997) of 20 October 1997, the recent pattern and
history of expenditures in the mission area, as well as the
repatriation, during the 1998/99 financial period, of the
military engineering support and demining units and related
reductions. The resulting decrease, when compared to the
1998/99 budget, is mostly due to the reduction in the
estimates for military personnel, which decrease in number
from 193 to 27 with the repatriation in the 1998/99 period of
the engineering support unit, and related operational costs,
as well the reduction in the estimates for civilian personnel
costs, reflecting a reduction of 15 international and local
posts.

12. Military personnel costs therefore decrease by
$5,879,000, or 43.6 per cent, over the budget for the 1998/99
period, while civilian personnel costs decrease by
$1,157,700, or 4.3 per cent. The budget provides for the
maintenance of 203 military observers, 27 military contingent

personnel, 81 civilian police, 280 international staff, 95 local 18. In paragraphs 11 to 14 of the report of the Secretary-
staff and 10 observers of the Organization of African Unity General of 28 January 1999 to the Security Council
(OAU). (S/1999/88), and paragraphs 16 to 18 of his report of 27
13. The Advisory Committee notes from the report of the
Secretary-General that the three factors affecting staff costs
are: a proposed reduction of civilian staffing by 5
international and 10 local posts, a proposed vacancy factor
of 15 and 10 per cent for international and local posts,
respectively, and a downward adjustment for international
civilian staff salaries and related costs in respect of mission
appointees, on the basis of such personnel representing 65
per cent of the total. 19. The action to be taken by the General Assembly at its
14. The Advisory Committee was provided, upon inquiry,
with the following average vacancy rates for the period from
1 July 1998 to 31 January 1999: 2.5 per cent for military
observers, 27.4 per cent for military contingents, 20.1 per
cent for civilian police, 21.4 per cent for international staff,
7.5 per cent for local staff and 20 per cent for OAU observers.
15. The Advisory Committee was informed that in view of
the continuing operational requirements of the Mission with
regard to engineering and logistical support of its activities,
in particular the maintenance of the three mission-owned base
camps and the logistics complex in Laayoune, it was
considered necessary to retain the Engineering and Logistics
Sections in the organizational structure of the Mission, headed
by Professional staff at the P-4 and P-3 levels, respectively.
16. Operational costs show a reduction of $2,327,600, or
16.8 per cent as compared with the budget for the 1998/99
period. The Secretary-General's estimate under air operations
provides for an amount of $6,959,300 — a decrease of
$1,103,300 when compared to the estimate for the current
1998/99 budget period. This decrease is mostly due to the
reduction in the number of helicopters from four to three after
repatriation of the engineering support unit, and a 44.5 per
cent decrease in the average cost of related aviation fuel; this
is partly offset by a 23.7 per cent increase in requirements for
hire/charter costs owing to the signing of a new contract in
January 1999. The reduction also includes lower costs under
fixed-wing aircraft attributable to reduced requirements for
aviation fuel for the two aircraft utilized in support of the
Mission's operational requirements and the third to be
deployed in connection with the identification process.
17. The requirements under transport operations, estimated
at $1,756,700, reflect a decrease of $525,100, or 30 per cent,
when compared to the 1998/99 period. The provision
provides for a fleet of 244 vehicles and includes the
replacement of 62 vehicles at $914,500 that have met the
necessary criteria for write-off.

April 1999 (S/1999/483), it is indicated that the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
continues, in close coordination with MINURSO, its
preparatory work for the repatriation of Saharan refugees, as
provided for under the United Nations Settlement Plan. The
Advisory Committee was informed that MINURSO would be
reimbursed should it provide support to UNHCR in this
regard.

fifty-third session in connection with the financing of
MINURSO is outlined in paragraph 27 of the proposed
budget (A/53/820). The Secretary-General recommends that
the Assembly appropriate the amount of $49,023,000 gross
($45,071,400 net), for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June
2000. Furthermore, the Secretary-General recommends that
this amount be assessed at the monthly rate of $4,085,250
gross ($3,755,950 net), subject to the extension of the
mandate of MINURSO by the Security Council beyond 30
June 1999.
20. The Advisory Committee points out, as stated in
paragraph 2 above, that the Security Council, in its most
recent resolution (resolution 1235 (1999)), decided to extend
the mandate of MINURSO until 14 May 1999. Furthermore,
in his most recent report to the Security Council
(S/1999/483), the Secretary-General indicated that, under a
revised outline calendar for the referendum process, the
identification process would resume on 1 June 1999 and be
completed in November 1999, and the appeals process would
begin on 1 July 1999 and be completed by February 2000,
with a view to holding the referendum in July 2000
(S/1999/483, para. 6). It is also indicated in that report that
from July 1999 onward the Mission would increase the
number of Identification Commission members from 25 to 30.
Additional administrative and support personnel would be
deployed, and an increase in its aviation assets and logistics
support equipment would be required to facilitate the
simultaneous conduct of both processes. The Mission would
also need additional premises in support of the Identifications
Commission's training of new staff in Laayoune (ibid., paras.
7 and 8).
21. As indicated by the Secretary-General in the same
report (ibid., para. 19), and as has been confirmed by
representatives of the Secretary-General to the Advisory
Committee, the financial requirements, at maintenance level,
related to the extension of the mandate of MINURSO beyond
14 May 1999, should the Security Council decide to extend
the mandate of the Mission, as recommended by the

Secretary-General, would be covered by the additional funds
appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 53/18
of 2 November 1998 for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30
June 1999 ($37.3 million, equivalent to $4.7 million per
month), and by the resources proposed by the
Secretary-General for the 12-month period from 1 July 1999
to 30 June 2000 in the report under consideration (A/53/820),
if provided by the Assembly. Moreover, as indicated by the
Secretary-General, should the implementation of the revised
timetable for the referendum process require additional
resources, the Secretary-General would seek additional
appropriation from the Assembly.
22. In view of the above, and the comments of the
Secretary-General in paragraph 25 of his most recent report
to the Security Council (S/1999/483) with regard to the many
assumptions upon which the timely implementation of the
calendar is predicated, the Advisory Committee concurs with
the requests of the Secretary-General and recommends that
the General Assembly appropriate, at this time, the amount
of $49,023,000 gross ($45,071,400 net) for the 12-month
period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, as mentioned in
paragraph 19 above, subject to the extension by the Security
Council of the mandate of the Mission beyond 14 May 1999.
