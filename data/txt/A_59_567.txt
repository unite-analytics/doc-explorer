Programme budget implications of recommendations contained in
the report of the Committee for Programme and Coordination

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/59/13), in
accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, on the
programme budget implications of paragraphs 347, 348 and 349 of the report of the
Committee for Programme and Coordination (A/59/16).

2. As indicated in the statement, under the terms of paragraph 347, the Secretary-
General would be requested to report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session,
and biennially thereafter, on the contribution made by the Department of
Management to the improvement of management practices in the Secretariat,
including measures to increase efficiency and productivity. Under the terms of
paragraph 348, he would be requested to develop a time-bound plan for the
reduction of duplication, complexity and bureaucracy in United Nations
administrative processes and procedures, including the adoption of a Secretariat-
wide approach to streamlining and automating them, and to report to the Assembly
at its sixtieth session on the plan and on the progress made in implementing it.

3. The Committee notes that the Secretary-General estimates that the reports
related to the requests in paragraphs 347 and 348 can be prepared within the existing
resources currently allocated under section 29A, Office of the Under-Secretary-
General for Management, of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005
(A/C.5/59/13, para. 4).

4. As further reflected in the statement, under the terms of paragraph 349, the
General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to develop improved tools
for identifying the cost of activities and outputs and to report to the Assembly at its
sixtieth session on options for applying cost-accounting techniques drawing on best
international practices. It is indicated in the statement (para. 5) that the request in
paragraph 349 would necessitate a feasibility study in 2005, which, according to the
Secretary-General, would require the services of a consulting firm specializing in
cost accounting. Such a study would (a) analyse available cost-accounting tools and
their applicability for identifying and analysing the costs of activities and outputs at
the United Nations; (b) cover the need for the potential adaptation of existing
systems for the provision of sustainable data (including IMIS and IMDIS); and
(c) look into ongoing requirements for the acquisition, implementation, management
and continued maintenance of the cost-accounting system.

5. The Committee was informed that, in preparing the programme budget
implications, the Secretariat had looked at availability within the United Nations
and the United Nations system and had concluded that the specialized expertise
required was not available.

6. The related additional resource requirements for the feasibility study are
estimated to amount to $500,000. The Committee was informed that this would
cover consultant fees, including software, as follows:

US dollars

Software 150 000
3 to 4 consultants for 12 weeks 350 000

Total 500 000

7. The Committee enquired as to the status of consultancy funds in the current
biennium for section 29 of the programme budget and was informed that, of the total
appropriation of $849,500, the balance, as at 30 September 2004, was $511,396,
with all funds already allocated or programmed.

8. The Committee notes that the cost of eventual implementation cannot be
“reliably projected at this time in advance of the required feasibility study” (see
A/C.5/59/13, para. 5).

9. The Committee further notes from the Secretary-General’s statement (para. 6)
that the programme budget implications were reported to the Committee for
Programme and Coordination at the time of the adoption of its report (see A/59/16,
para. 14), and to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 2004,
in accordance with rule 31 of the rules of procedure of the Council.

10. The Advisory Committee recalls that cost measurement exercises have
been attempted by the United Nations and its funds and programmes a number
of times since the 1970s, with varying degrees of success. The Committee has, in
the past, pointed to the need to ensure that such exercises not be time-
consuming and cumbersome and that, once the initial data has been collected,
any long-term system be simple to administer. Moreover, as has been stated by

A/59/567

the Committee in the past, the cost of such an exercise must always be
considered in relation to its potential benefit and practical usefulness.

11. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform
the General Assembly that, should it endorse the recommendations contained
in paragraphs 347, 348 and 349 of the report of the Committee for Programme
and Coordination (A/59/16), the programme of work under section 29,
Management and central support services, of the programme budget for the
biennium 2004-2005, would be modified as indicated in paragraph 3 of the
Secretary-General’s statement (A/C.5/59/13), and an additional amount of
$500,000 would be required under section 29B, Office of Programme Planning,
Budget and Accounts, of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005,
subject to the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency fund.
