Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Board.1 The
Committee also had before it the report of the Secretary-General on the investments
of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (A/C.5/57/11) and the report of the
Board of Auditors on the accounts of the Fund for the biennium ended 31 December
2001.2 During its consideration of these matters, the Committee met with the
Chairman of the Pension Board, representatives of the Secretary-General and the
Chief Executive Officer of the Pension Fund.

II. Actuarial matters

2. Paragraphs 16 to 48 of the report of the Pension Board deal with actuarial
matters, including the results of the twenty-sixth actuarial valuation of the Fund
carried out as at 31 December 2001. The previous valuation had been prepared as at
31 December 1999 and its results were reported to the General Assembly at its fifty-
fifth session in 2000.3 The actuarial valuation determines whether the present and
estimated future assets of the Fund will be sufficient to meet its liabilities.

3. For the twenty-sixth regular valuation, the Committee of Actuaries proposed
and the Pension Board approved the 5.5/8.5/5 set of assumptions.4 The results of the
valuation showed an actuarial surplus of 2.92 per cent of pensionable remuneration
or $4,284.4 million in dollar terms. The Committee was provided with a table
showing the evolution of actuarial valuation of the fund since 1976 both in absolute
terms and as a percentage of projected liabilities (see the annex to present report).

4. In paragraph 48 of its report, the Pension Board noted the conclusion of the
Committee of Actuaries in paragraph 37 “that it would be prudent to set aside, for



2
A/57/490

adverse contingencies, a portion of the surplus equivalent to at least 1.0 per cent but
not more than 2.0 per cent of pensionable remuneration, subject to future review”.
The Board also agreed with the conclusion of the Committee of Actuaries, as
indicated in paragraph 39, “that the present contribution rate of 23.7 per cent of
pensionable remuneration was sufficient to meet the benefits requirements under the
Plan”. The Advisory Committee agrees with this view and recommends that the
present contribution rate of 23.7 per cent be retained. In this connection, the
Committee recalls the provisions of General Assembly resolution 53/210 of 18
December 1998 “that the Pension Board should continue to monitor closely the
evolution of the actuarial valuation of the Fund and that no attempt should be
made to reduce the present rate of contributions to the Fund or change any
other features unless and until a pattern of surpluses emerges in future
valuations.”

5. Transfer agreements between the Fund and the European Organization for the
Safety of Air Navigation and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe are discussed in paragraphs 52 to 55 of the report of the Pension Board. The
Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 54 of the report that the Pension Board
decided to approve the proposed transfer agreements with both Eurocontrol and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, subject to the concurrence of
the General Assembly, as required under article 13 of the Pension Fund Regulations.
The Advisory Committee agrees with the position of the Pension Board on
these issues.

III. Investments of the Pension Fund

6. For the reporting period, the market value of the Fund’s assets decreased by
$4,267 million, from $26,056 million on 31 March 2000 to $21,789 million on 31
March 2002, or 16.4 per cent. The Advisory Committee was provided with updated
information on developments in the financial markets and related changes in the
Fund’s portfolio of assets since the end of the reporting period. The market value of
the Fund had continued to decline. The Committee was informed that, during
September 2002, financial markets remained volatile, as did the Fund, whose market
value fluctuated between $20,771 million and $19,865 million.

7. Investment matters are dealt with in paragraphs 56 to 85 of the report of the
Board. The Committee notes that the Board, in paragraph 82, expressed deep
concern over the significant reduction of the market value of the Fund’s
investments, reaffirmed that the respective roles of the Board, the Secretary-
General, the Investments Committee and management should be maintained and not
confused and invited all concerned parties to continue communicating with each
other.

8. The Advisory Committee exchanged views with the representatives of the
Secretary-General, the Chairman of the Pension Board and the Chief Executive
Officer on the issues raised in paragraphs 81 to 83 of the report of the Board. The
Committee recalls that, under article 19 of the regulations of the Fund, “the
investments of the assets of the Fund shall be decided upon by the Secretary-General
after consultation with an investment committee in the light of the observations and
suggestions made from time to time by the Board on the investment policy.” The
Committee fully endorses the statement of the Board referred to in paragraph 7



3
A/57/490

above, especially on the need to avoid confusion of roles vis-à-vis investments.
To this end, the Committee stresses the importance of ensuring that the
fiduciary responsibility of the Secretary-General, under the regulations of the
Fund, to take decisions on the investments of the assets of the Fund should
under no circumstances be compromised.

9. The Pension Board, in paragraph 83 of its report, invited the Secretary-General
to undertake a review of the procedures and operating methods of the Investment
Management Service, including an evaluation of internal procedures for risk
management and security. The Board also requested the Secretary-General to submit
to the Standing Committee, at its next meeting, the terms of reference for an
independent external performance review of the investment of the Fund, together
with the cost implications of such a review.

10. The Committee exchanged views with the representatives of the Secretary-
General and sought additional clarification on those subjects. The Committee
has concluded from the testimony before it and from additional information
that has been provided that the Investment Management Service has not
received sufficiently clear and precise guidance in order for it to proceed in the
manner contemplated by the Board. This matter should be clarified before the
Investment Management Service is expected to proceed any further. Moreover,
despite the reaffirmation by the Board referred to in paragraph 7 above, the
Advisory Committee remains concerned with the lack of precision as to the
basis for the request to review the Investment Management Service. In the
opinion of the Advisory Committee, it should be understood by all that use of
the results of the study and any subsequent executive action taken further to it,
remain the responsibility of the Secretary-General as the one with fiduciary
responsibility for the investments of the Fund, under article 19 of its
regulations. To avoid confusion, the Advisory Committee suggests that, in
future, in order to ensure cost-effective use of the administrative resources of
the Fund, requests for reviews and studies of the type indicated above be
clearer regarding the basis for the request, and that they be specific as to the
objective of the study or review and the results expected.

IV. Investments Committee

11. Article 20 of the regulations of the Fund provides that members of the
Investments Committee shall be appointed by the Secretary-General after
consultation with the Pension Board and the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly. The
Secretary-General conveyed to the Board the names of three members of the
Investments Committee whom he intended to propose to the Assembly for
confirmation at its fifty-sixth session, after consultation with the Advisory
Committee. They would all be reappointed as members for further terms of three
years, commencing on 1 January 2003.5 The Committee has written in this regard to
the Secretary-General to convey its concurrence.

12. The Advisory Committee notes that the Pension Board also invited the
Secretary-General to consider greater diversification of the Investments Committee
in order to provide the requisite expertise in all major areas on investment.6

V. Financial statements of the Fund and report of the Board
of Auditors

13. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 5 of the report of the Pension
Board that the Board examined and approved the financial statements and related
data on the operations of the Fund for the biennium ended 31 December 2001 and
considered the report of the Board of Auditors on the accounts and operations of the
Fund. The Board also considered a report on the internal audits of the Fund (see
para. 24 below). The examination of the report of the Board of Auditors by the
Pension Board is reported on in paragraphs 86 to 95 of the report of the Pension
Board.

14. As indicated in paragraphs 34 and 35 of the report of the Board of Auditors,
the Fund relies on two sources of income: contributions from employing
organizations and employees and investment income. Since 1994, contributions have
not covered all benefits paid in the year. The Board has found that investment
income has become an increasingly necessary source of additional income to cover
benefits and all administrative and investment expenditures. As shown in table XII.1
of the report of the Board of Auditors, total contributions represented 87.2 per cent
of benefits in 2001, as compared with 97.5 per cent in 1994. The Board of Auditors
has consequently noted that, while presenting no short-term risk, the actuarial
valuations in 2001 indicate that the Fund should exercise caution before changing
the level of contributions or benefits (see para. 46 of the report of the Board of
Auditors). The Advisory Committee agrees with the opinion of the Board of
Auditors.

15. Investment management issues were reviewed by the Board of Auditors in
paragraphs 53-75 of its report. In paragraph 67, the Board of Auditors recommended
that the Pension Fund supplement the United Nations Staff Rules with guidelines
related to specific Fund activities and that a compliance officer function be
introduced to ensure compliance at all levels with both existing Staff Rules and
supplementary guidelines. The Advisory Committee notes that, in paragraph 95 of
its report, the Pension Board indicated that the United Nations standards of conduct
were applicable to the staff of the Investment Management Service, as were the
Financial Rules and Regulations. Upon request, the representatives of the Secretary-
General clarified further the basis for the Pension Board’s position as stated in
paragraph 95 of its report (see para. 17 below).

16. The findings and recommendations of the Board of Auditors on cash
management matters are included under subparagraph (f) of main findings in the
summary of the report of the Board and in paragraphs 59 to 65 of the report. The
Advisory Committee was informed that the Fund is currently involved in the
negotiation of contracts for new, worldwide banking arrangements, a process that
had started in the fall of 2001. When the new banking arrangements are in place, the
management of the Pension Fund expects to implement, as rapidly as possible, the
recommendations of the Board of Auditors with respect to cash management.

17. The Committee requests that, in the future, the reasons for not
implementing a recommendation of the Board of Auditors be clearly stated
both in the report of the Pension Board and in the communication from the
administrations concerned. The Committee notes, for example, that the Board
of Auditors has strongly recommended that a compliance function be



5
A/57/490

introduced in the Investment Management Service to ensure compliance at all
levels with both existing staff rules and supplementary guidelines. Despite the
additional clarification provided, the Committee recommends that the
Investment Management Service discuss the status of this recommendation
with the Board of Auditors. The results of this should be reported to the
Standing Committee, in the context of the report requested by the Pension
Board in paragraph 83 of its report, with an indication of the action taken to
implement the recommendation of the Board of Auditors, or, in the event of
non-implementation, a clear indication of the reasons therefor. The Advisory
Committee intends to revert to this matter in the context of its consideration of
the administrative budget of the Fund for the biennium 2004-2005.

18. Furthermore, the Committee requests that, in the future, information in
the report of the Board of Auditors, some of which might be based on previous
findings by the Internal Audit Service, be updated to avoid confusion. For
example, the Committee was informed that some of the comments in paragraph
85 of the report of the Board of Auditors about systems that were year-2000
non-compliant was already out of date as action had already taken place to
effect compliance.

VI. Benefit provisions of the Fund

19. Benefit provisions of the Fund are discussed in paragraphs 141 to 166 of the
report of the Pension Board. As indicated in paragraphs 11 and 157 of the report, the
Pension Board recommended that the General Assembly approve the following
benefit provisions of the Fund: (a) to apply cost-of-living adjustments to deferred
retirement benefits as from age 50, rather than from age 55 as is currently the case;
(b) to apply cost-of-living differential factors, also for deferred retirement benefits,
as from the day of separation; and (c) to eliminate the limitation on the right to
restoration of prior service. The Advisory Committee notes that, in making its
recommendations, the Board focused on the measures that further promoted the new
human resources framework, which had been adopted by the International Civil
Service Commission and the General Assembly. The Advisory Committee agrees
with the recommendation of the Board, subject to the provisions of General
Assembly resolution 53/210 as quoted in paragraph 4 above.

20. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 158 of the report that the
Pension Board also approved a measure to eliminate the 1.5 percentage point
reduction in the first adjustment based on the consumer price index due to existing
and future beneficiaries, with the understanding that the implementation of this
modification would be subject to a surplus being shown in the next actuarial
valuation, to be performed as at 31 December 2003. The Committee was informed
that the Pension Board and the General Assembly would decide on the actual
implementation date in 2004 (that is, after the results of the Fund’s actuarial
valuation as at 31 December 2003 were known); that date could be set at 1 April
2004 (the date of the first adjustment after 31 December 2003) or at 1 April 2005
(the date of the first adjustment due after the General Assembly action in the fall of
2004). The Pension Board did not specifically address in its meeting of July 2002
the question of the effective date for the implementation of this change in the Fund’s
pension adjustment system.

VII. Administrative matters of the Fund

21. The Advisory Committee notes that the Pension Board considered revised
budget estimates for the biennium 2002-2003, reflecting an increase of $179,200
over the initially approved budget of $29,943,800 for the biennium 2002-2003 for
the purposes indicated in paragraph 96 of the report of the Pension Board. The
Advisory Committee agrees with the recommendation of the Pension Board
that the General Assembly approve an increase in the resources under
administrative costs from $29,943,800 to $30,123,000 for the biennium 2002-
2003.7

22. In paragraphs 100 to 104 of its report, the Pension Board discusses the whole-
office review of the staffing structure and levels of both the Fund’s secretariat and
the Investment Management Service, requested by the Standing Committee of the
Pension Board at its July 2001 meeting. The Advisory Committee notes that the
Pension Board decided to take no action on the requests for reclassification and for
new posts and that the Fund’s proposals would be presented to the Standing
Committee in 2003, as part of the Fund’s budget proposal for the biennium 2004-
2005.

23. The Advisory Committee notes the information provided in paragraphs 105 to
107 of the report of the Pension Board on the issues concerning the office space for
the Fund. The Committee recalls that the Standing Committee had suggested that the
Fund look into the possibility of acquiring premises outside the United Nations for
the Fund’s secretariat, including relocation options for back-office processing (see
A/56/7/Add.1, para. 27). The Committee reiterates its view that a long-term
solution for the office space problem of the Fund should be found, including the
possibility of the acquisition of its own premises. In this connection, the
Committee requests that the procedure outlined in General Assembly
resolution 53/210 of 18 December 1998 on the United Nations pension system be
followed and that it be apprised in the first instance when a firm determination
is made in this respect.

24. The internal audit coverage of the Fund’s activities is discussed in paragraphs
115 to 120 of the report of the Pension Board. The Advisory Committee was
informed that the Board considered a report of the Office of Internal Oversight
Services on the internal auditing of the Pension Fund during the period from 1 May
2000 to 30 April 2002. The Committee exchanged views with representatives of the
Secretary-General and the Chief Executive Officer and obtained additional
information from the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services. In
the following paragraphs, the Committee has taken into account the additional
information it received orally and in writing regarding internal audit services for the
Fund.

25. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraphs 117 to 119 of the report that
additional resources, consisting of two new P-4 posts and the amount of $425,000 to
cover expenses such as consultancy fees, travel and training, were requested by the
Office of Internal Oversight Services for the biennium 2002-2003; however, the
Pension Board decided not to recommend for approval by the General Assembly the
additional resources requested by the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The
Committee recalls that the resources approved for the biennium 2002-2003 for
internal audit purposes took into account the wide scope and complexity of the



7
A/57/490

proposed internal audits planned for 2002-2003 so that the work programme would
be carried out effectively and in conformity with accepted professional auditing
standards (see A/56/7/Add.1, para. 30). Under the circumstances, the Committee
endorses the views of the Pension Board. The Committee further recommends
that additional requests identified by the Office of Internal Oversight Services
be discussed with the Chief Executive Officer in time for him to submit his
proposals to the Pension Board in the context of the proposed budget of the
Fund for 2004-2005.

26. The Advisory Committee further notes that the Pension Board also decided to
request that the Fund secretariat prepare a study, for the 2003 meeting of the
Standing Committee, on alternative arrangements that could be considered for the
performance of the internal audit function for the Pension Fund, including the
possible establishment of a unit within the Fund secretariat or outsourcing of the
function to an entity other than the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The
Committee further notes that the Board of Auditors has reviewed the work
performed by the Office of Internal Oversight Services in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and
was “pleased to acknowledge the valuable work done by the Office of Internal
Oversight Services in providing sound internal audit services to the Fund and to the
Investment Management Service” (para. 104 of the report of the Board of Auditors).
The Committee points out that, during its review of the matter, it was not
provided with any compelling argument in support of a decision to discontinue
the internal audit services of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The
Committee cautions against a hasty decision on this matter. Before the current
arrangement is modified, the cost-effectiveness of such a change needs to be
analysed thoroughly. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Board of
Auditors carry out an assessment of the capacity and professional expertise
required by the Office of Internal Oversight Services to provide internal audit
services to the administrative and investment activities of the Pension Fund, in
accordance with commonly accepted industry standards for the audit of
pension funds, and report in the context of its next audit for the biennium
2002-2003. The Board of Auditors may wish to have recourse to outside
expertise for this assessment. In this connection, the Committee recalls its
comments and recommendations in paragraph 13 of its report A/57/439.

VIII. Other matters

27. Among the other matters considered by the Pension Board that require action
by the General Assembly was the review of the size and composition of the Pension
Board. The Board discusses the matter in paragraphs 205 to 220 of its report. As
indicated in paragraphs 11 (d) and 217 of its report, the Board recommends that the
General Assembly approve the increase in the size of the Board from 33 members to
36. The three additional seats would be allocated to the United Nations Staff
Pension Committee (that is, in accordance with article 6 of the regulations of the
Fund, one additional member to be elected by the General Assembly, one additional
member to be appointed by the Secretary-General and one additional member from
the participants in the Fund) owing to the significant growth in the number of
participants from the United Nations.8 The increase in the size of the Board would
require that the General Assembly approve the amendments to articles 5 and 6 of the



8
A/57/490

Pension Fund regulations, as well as of appendix 1 to the rules of procedure of the
Fund.9 The Advisory Committee agrees with the proposal of the Board.

28. The Advisory Committee points out that, should the General Assembly
approve the recommendation of the Pension Board, it will need to elect one
additional representative of the General Assembly to the United Nations Staff
Pension Committee, resulting in a representation of five members and four alternate
members from the General Assembly to the Pension Board. The Committee recalls
that, in the past, members and alternate members were designated at the time of
election by the General Assembly. The Committee understands that this practice is
currently not followed, which has given rise to difficulties in determining the
representation of the General Assembly at both the Pension Board and the Standing
Committee sessions. In this regard, the Committee recommends that the
General Assembly review the manner in which members and alternate
members representing the General Assembly are elected to the United Nations
Staff Pension Committee under article 6 of the regulations of the Fund.
