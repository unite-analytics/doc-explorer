Verification Mission in Guatemala

Financing of the Military Observer Group of the United
Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and requirements for mission subsistence allowance for military
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the observers and miscellaneous supplies and services.
Secretary-General on the financing of the Military Observer
Group of the United Nations Verification Mission in
Guatemala (MINUGUA) for the period from 15 February to
31 May 1997 (A/53/775). The Committee has also considered
the final disposition of the assets of the Military Observer
Group. During its consideration of the report, the Committee
met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who
provided additional information and clarification.
2. As indicated in paragraph 6 of the report, total
resources made available to the Military Observer Group for
the period from 15 February to 31 May 1997 amounted to $4
million gross ($3,956,300 net). The related expenditures, as
indicated in paragraph 6 of and annex I to the report, amount
to $3,946,000 gross and net. Prior period obligations
amounting to $130,200 were subsequently liquidated, as
indicated in annex IX to the report, reducing expenditures to
$3,815,800. The resulting unencumbered balance therefore
amounts to $184,200 gross ($140,500 net). This balance
resulted primarily from civilian staff vacancies and lower
requirements for utilities and commercial communications.
These under-expenditures were partially offset by additional

3. Paragraph 7 of the report indicates that, as of 30 April
1997, a total of $3,969,802 had been assessed on Member
States for the reporting period and that contributions received
as at 31 October 1998 amounted to $3,651,046. The resulting
shortfall is $318,756. Unliquidated obligations as at 31
December 1998 amounted to $12,336. These were related to
the travel of military observers.
4. Under-expenditures of $62,000 are reported under
civilian personnel costs (see A/53/775, annex II.B). The
original cost estimates provided for a staffing complement of
10 international and 20 local staff. The Committee notes,
however, that only three international staff were deployed
during the demobilization process owing to “difficulties in
identifying candidates with the required language and
experience and within the specified time-frame” and that
administrative backstopping had to be provided by existing
MINUGUA staff. The Committee believes that this issue
should be looked into in order to prevent this from recurring
in future missions or operations.
5. Additional requirements of $170,000 were reported
under mission subsistence allowance for the military
observers. According to the explanation provided in

$246,100 resulted under hire/charter costs of helicopters (see
A/53/775, annex II.B, para. 18). The Committee recalls that
the cost estimates contained in the report of the Secretary-
General dated 3 March 1997 (A/51/815) provided for the
hiring of three helicopters for use by the Military Observer 10. The second group consisted of assets with an inventory

information on the final disposition of the assets of the
Military Observer Group, which is guided by the policies and
principles for the liquidation of assets proposed by the
Secretary-General (see A/48/945 and Corr.1, para. 110),
recommended by the Committee (A/49/664, para. 116) and
approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/233
A of 23 December 1994. The Committee notes that the assets
of the Military Observer Group, based on inventory value,
were estimated at $1.2 million as at 31 May 1997. As
indicated in paragraph 16 of the financial performance report,
they have been placed into three groups detailed therein. The
Committee notes that group I includes assets with an 12. Paragraph 17 of the report outlines the actions that need

Board. Moreover, during construction of a shelving unit in
the electronic data-processing section of the warehouse, they
disappeared. The Local Property Survey Board, after
consideration of the case and in view of the circumstances
involved, recommended that the United Nations absorb the
loss of the nine laptops. In view of the amounts being spent
in replacing data-processing equipment, the Committee
reiterates the importance of ensuring that safety and
accountability procedures are in place to deter such losses and
penalize those responsible.

Military Observer Group, to the Peace-keeping Reserve Fund,
as was the case with the United Nations Observer Mission in
El Salvador (see General Assembly resolution 50/246 of 17
September 1996), or to credit Member States their respective
share, as was done in the case of the United Nations
Operation in Mozambique (see General Assembly resolution
52/240 of 26 June 1998). The Committee also recommends
approval of the special arrangements as regards article IV of
the financial regulations, and that the General Assembly take
note of the report on the disposition of the assets of the
Military Observer Group.
