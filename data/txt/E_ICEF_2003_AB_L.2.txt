The UNICEF recovery policy: Report of the Advisory
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) on recovery policy (E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1). The report was
prepared to review the current recovery policy for support costs for other resources
programmes (formerly called supplementary-funded programmes). During the
consideration of the matter, the Committee met with representatives of the Executive
Director, who provided additional information.

2. On the basis of UNICEF recommendations in document E/ICEF/1998/AB/L.6,
in its decision 1998/21 (E/ICEF/1998/6/Rev.1), the Executive Board approved an
interim recovery policy and requested a review in 2002.** The Advisory Committee
notes that the review of the recovery policy by the UNICEF Executive Board has
been rescheduled for the first regular session in 2003. As an interim measure, in its
decision 1998/21, the Executive Board decided that, “to cover the support costs to
be incurred in the 1999 support budget, the recovery rate was to be increased from 3
to 5 per cent, while recognizing that the indirect support costs incurred in field
offices and headquarters for supplementary funding exceeded this rate.” As decided
by the Executive Board, this rate was to be applied to all new agreements to be
signed after the second regular session of the Executive Board in 1998. The
Executive Board also authorized that the interest earned on the supplementary
funding cash balances was to continue to be used, as an interim measure, to cover
the shortfall in the recovery.

3. For the biennium 2000-2001, the Advisory Committee was informed that, on
the basis of a 5 per cent recovery rate, support costs charged to other resources
programmes amounted to some $55 million, or 5 per cent of the final programme
expenditure of $1,104 million funded from other resources in the biennium (see also
E/ICEF/2001/AB/L.10, para. 8). The interest income earned on other resources cash
balances amounted to $39.6 million (or about 3.6 per cent of the other resources
programme expenditure) and was also used to cover support costs of other resources
programmes. Thus, an effective total recovery rate of 8.6 per cent was applied in
2000-2001 to cover support costs incurred for other resources programmes.

4. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in the context of its review of the
UNICEF biennial support budget proposal for the biennium 2002-2003
(E/ICEF/2001/AB/L.10), it indicated that the Executive Director should review the
policy implications of the rapid increase in other resources and trust funds, as
compared with regular resources. The review should include the effect, if any, on
priorities in planning and in programme formulation and approval, as well as in
terms of management capacity of the administration in situations where regular
resources were decreasing, with inadequate recovery from other resources and trust
funds (E/ICEF/2001/AB/L.11, para. 15).

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that efforts to increase regular
resources via the resource mobilization strategy and multi-year funding framework
approved by the Executive Board in decision 1999/8 (E/ICEF/1999/7/Rev.1) have
not produced increases in regular resources. The medium-term strategic plan for the
period 2002-2005, approved in decision 2001/22 (E/ICEF/2001/6), requires an
increase in regular resources to fund organizational priorities in country
programmes. For the biennium 2000-2001, regular resources accounted for 47 per
cent of total resources, while other resources (including emergency funding)
represented 53 per cent of total resources (see also E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, table 1).

6. The Advisory Committee recalls that UNICEF was to review its recovery
policy in 2002 after the United Nations Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) completed a
system-wide study on the subject of support costs related to extrabudgetary
activities in organizations of the United Nations system (E/ICEF/2001/AB/L.10).
The Advisory Committee notes that, in her report E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, the
Executive Director has taken into account the views of JIU in its report
JIU/REP/2002/3 of June 2002 and of the Committee, as indicated in paragraphs 9,
11-13 and 16 of its report E/ICEF/1998/AB/L.12 of 18 June 1998 on the UNICEF
recovery policy.

7. The Advisory Committee notes that the methodology proposed in paragraph 13
of document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1 would be used to calculate the programme
support and management and administration costs for other resources programmes
(E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, para. 32 (c)). According to the proposed methodology, the
support costs chargeable to regular resources programmes and to other resources
programmes are calculated separately using the proportion of variable costs for
regular resources and other resources programmes. Fixed costs are excluded from
the calculation. Definitions of fixed and variable costs for various divisions and
offices at headquarters are shown in annex I to document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1.

8. For the field offices, as indicated in paragraph 15 of the report, for the
biennium 2000-2001, the total cumulative programme expenditure for all country
offices has the split of 44 per cent to 56 per cent for regular resources, as compared



3
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.2

with other resources programmes. This proportion has been used to determine the
variable support costs for regular resources and for other resources. Annex II of the
report shows that, for the biennium 2000-2001, the percentage of other resources
support to total other resources programme expenditure was 6.0 per cent for field
offices (4.7 per cent for country offices and 1.3 per cent for regional offices).

9. For headquarters programme support units, the ratio of 44/56 for the
breakdown of regular resources programme expenditure to other resources
programme expenditure was also used as an approximate ratio for the breakdown of
the support costs between regular resources and other resources. On the basis of
2000-2001expenditure data, the percentage of other resources support to total other
resources programme expenditure was estimated at 2.5 per cent for headquarters
programme support units (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, para. 17 and annex II).

10. For headquarters management and administration units, using again
expenditure data for the biennium 2000-2001, the breakdown of the variable costs
borne by regular resources as compared with variable costs borne by other resources
was estimated to be in the ratio of 40 per cent to 60 per cent and the percentage of
support was 3.5 per cent net. Taking into account the support costs attributable to
headquarters programme support units of 2.5 per cent mentioned in paragraph 9
above, the total support costs attributable to headquarters units for supporting other
resources programmes was 6.0 per cent of the total other resources programme
expenditure in the biennium 2000-2001 (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, annex II). This
represents an increase from the 3 per cent utilized in the current recovery policy for
headquarters units, as a result of changes in the classification of fixed and variable
costs as well as the increasing proportion of other resources (see
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, para. 24 and table 4). The Advisory Committee is not
convinced that a case has been made to apply the ratio 40/60 of variable costs borne
by regular resources to variable costs borne by other resources to the headquarters
management and administration units (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, annex II). The
Committee has indicated that the UNICEF administrative and support budget for
headquarters continues to include top heavy and costly structures (see, for example,
E/ICEF/1999/AB/L.10, paras. 22-29 and E/ICEF/2001/AB/L.11, paras. 24 and 34-
37).

11. The Advisory Committee requested clarification on the time-survey study done
to calculate the administrative handling costs incurred for the standard process for a
sample of other resources contributions mentioned in paragraph 25 and annex III of
document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1. The Committee was provided with a description of
the standard process discussed in paragraph 25 of document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1
and a comparison of support costs for other resources for headquarters programme
support units and management and administration units between those presented in
the current document (E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1) with those included in the 1998
recovery cost document (E/ICEF/1998/AB/L.6) (see annex to this report).

12. In paragraph 24 and table 4 of document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, it is indicated
that the total cost of supporting other resources programmes amounts to a total of 12
per cent, of which 6 per cent is attributable to field offices support and 6 per cent
attributable to headquarters support. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph
26 of document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1 that a sliding scale of support cost rates from
12 per cent to 9 per cent is proposed to take into account the size of contributions.
The Committee requested further justification for the proposed sliding scale of



4
E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.2

support cost rates. From the information provided, the Committee sees little
justification for the proposed sliding scale of recovery rates; indeed such a
procedure could lead to protracted negotiation with donors.

13. In addition to the sliding scale referred to above, in paragraphs 27-30 of
document E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, a 2 per cent lower rate is recommended to be
applied for contributions into thematic funds (see E/ICEF/2003/AB/L.1, para. 7 for
an explanation of thematic funds). Furthermore, in addition, “to reduce the
administrative burden to collect donor funds and provide more predictability, it is
recommended also that if 80 per cent of the funds is received upon signing the
agreements, a 1 per cent lower recovery rate would be applied. If 100 per cent is
received, 2 per cent lower rate would be applied.” The application of the lower rates
is summarized in the table shown in paragraph 29 of the Executive Director’s report.
The Advisory Committee believes that the implementation of the proposed recovery
rates schedule may be cumbersome to apply and, as with the sliding scale referred to
in paragraph 12 above, may lead to contention as to the timing of contributions.

14. Rather than using a sliding scale under the proposed revised recovery policy,
the Advisory Committee recommends that, as an interim measure, the recovery rate
be increased from 5 per cent to 8 per cent of the actual other resources programme
expenditure to cover the support costs incurred. Such an increase in the recovery
rate should allow the interest income accrued on other resources cash balances to be
credited to regular resources instead of being used to supplement support cost
recovery. The Committee intends to revert to the matter and re-examine the
experience of the application of this rate during its consideration of the biennial
budget estimates for future bienniums.
