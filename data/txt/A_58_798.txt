Financing of the United Nations Mission in Liberia

Proposed budget for the United Nations Mission in Liberia
for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

Appropriation 2003/04 $564,494,300

Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General 2004/05 $834,155,400

Recommendation of the Administrative Committee 2004/05 $821,986,000

1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 20, 22, 28 and
30 below would entail a reduction of $12,169,400 to the proposed budget for the
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30
June 2005. The Committee also makes a number of observations and
recommendations with regard to the administration and management of the Mission
and opportunities for further savings.

2. The report of the Secretary-General of 22 March 2004 (A/58/744) contains no
financial performance information for the financial period 2002/03 since the
Mission started during the current financial period (2003/04).

I. Information on performance for the current period

3. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 31 March 2004, a total of
$446,183,000 had been assessed on Member States in respect of UNMIL since its
inception. Payments received as at the same date amounted to $284,764,000, leaving
an outstanding balance of $161,419,000. As at 31 March 2004, the cash position of
the Mission was $159,400,000.

4. The Advisory Committee was also informed that reimbursement to Member
States for troops and equipment as at 31 March 2004 totalled $18,157,000. In



2
A/58/798

respect of death and disability compensation, $100,000 was paid as at 31 March
2004 for two claims, no claims were pending and unliquidated obligations amounted
to $581,000.

5. According to the Secretariat, the incumbency for UNMIL for the period from 1
July 2003 to 30 June 2004 was as follows (as at 30 April 2004):

Authorized Incumbered
Vacancy rate
(percentage)

Military observers 215 169 21.4

Military contingents 14 785 13 955 5.6

Civilian police 755 393 47.8

Police in formed units 360 239 33.6

International staff 607 302 50.2

National staff 768 317 58.7

United Nations Volunteers 286 131 54.2

6. The Committee was informed that by mid-May 2004, the Mission would have
421 international staff on board and that the number was expected to be close to
500, i.e., a vacancy rate of 18 per cent, by the end of the current financial period.
The projected vacancy rate in the category of national staff, including staff currently
working on a daily-hire basis, is expected to be about 5 per cent by the end of the
current financial period; moreover, in addition to 131 United Nations Volunteers on
board as at 30 April 2004, 49 Volunteers would arrive in the Mission area by 30
June 2004 and that would bring the vacancy rate from the current level of 54.2 per
cent to 37.1 per cent. The Committee was also informed that by 30 June 2004, there
would be 431 national staff holding regular appointments.

7. The Advisory Committee was provided with expenditure data for the period
from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 as at 31 March 2004 (see annex I below).
Expenditure for the period amounted to $237,837,300 gross ($237,260,700 net)
against the appropriation of $564,494,300 gross ($559,284,300 net). The Secretariat
also provided the Committee with an estimated expenditure for the current financial
period broken down by major category of budget costs as follows:

Appropriation Projected expenditure Variance

Military and police personnel 200 287 300 278 114 000 (77 826 700)

Civilian personnel 51 655 300 35 506 100 16 149 200

Operational costs 312 551 700 250 780 300 61 771 400

Total (gross) 564 494 300 564 400 400 93 900

8. According to the Secretariat, the projected overexpenditure in the cost of the
deployment of troops would be offset by savings under civilian personnel costs due
to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel and savings in operational costs.
The Committee was informed that the projected overexpenditure under military and
police personnel is due mainly to deployment of troops and contingent-owned
equipment by air ($52 million); according to the original troop deployment plan, 80



3
A/58/798

per cent of the troops and their contingent-owned equipment should have been
transported by sea and 20 per cent by air; however, owing to the delayed readiness
of a number of contingents, approximately 80 per cent of the troops and their
contingent-owned equipment had to be transported by air to meet the immediate
operational requirements of the Mission. The Committee is concerned about the
projected cost overrun and expects that the Secretariat would draw the
necessary lessons from this experience in order to minimize in the future
unplanned airlifting of troops. Moreover, the Committee points out that in
order to reach the level of expenditure projected, the Mission would have to
spend about $326 million in three months (April-June 2004) as compared to an
expenditure of $238 million spent during the previous eight months (from 1
August 2003-31 March 2004). In this connection, it should be noted that
information on unliquidated obligations is not available to the Committee.

9. The Advisory Committee was informed that although the actual expenditures
under quick-impact projects reflect a moderate pace of project implementation
($183,100 as at 31 March 2004, compared with the appropriation of $1,000,000), the
Mission projected full and complete utilization of all budgeted funds for the
projects. Moreover, the Committee was informed that the Mission was in a position
to identify quick-impact projects substantially exceeding in volume the current
budget of $1 million. The Committee recalls, in this connection, that the General
Assembly, in its resolution 55/135 of 8 December 2000, endorsed the proposals,
recommendations and conclusions contained in the report of the Special Committee
on Peacekeeping Operations which supported, inter alia, “exploration of the concept
that a small percentage of a mission’s first-year budget should be made available to
the head of mission to fund quick-impact projects targeted at enhancing the
mission’s effectiveness in implementing its mandate in its area of operations” (see
A/C.4/55/6, para. 6). The Committee points out that funds currently budgeted for
quick-impact projects of the Mission amount to approximately 0.2 per cent of the
apportionment for the financial period 2003/04.

II. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2004 to
30 June 2005

A. Mandate and planned results

10. The Advisory Committee commends the Mission for the progress it has
made in formulating its budget document using results-based techniques. The
Committee is of the opinion, however, that further improvements could be
made in a number of areas of the budget presentation in the results-based
budget framework. For example, there should be a clearer and better-defined
linkage between proposed resources and programmed outputs and
accomplishments. Moreover, the identification of external factors under a
number of components should be further improved.

11. The activities of the Mission as programmed in the results-based budget format
are grouped into six components, as follows: (i) executive direction and
management; (ii) ceasefire; (iii) humanitarian and human rights; (iv) security
reform; (v) peace process; and (vi) support. The Advisory Committee was informed
that these activities were derived from the Integrated Mandate Implementation Plan,



4
A/58/798

which is a consolidated mission-wide strategic and operational framework which, on
the basis of Security Council resolution 1509 (2003), identifies objectives that are to be
achieved and core programmes to achieve them. The core programmes are:
consolidating and strengthening peace and security; disarmament and demobilization;
rehabilitation and reintegration; strengthening the rule of law; improving human rights
conditions; strengthening civil affairs; conducting public information and coordinating
United Nations agencies. Each core programme has enumerated specific goals, projects
and time lines. According to the Secretariat, the two mechanisms (integrated mandate
implementation plan and results-based budget) reinforce each other to ensure the
effective and resource-efficient implementation of the UNMIL mandate.

12. The Committee was informed that UNMIL has attempted to implement its core
programmes in accordance with the established time lines, in spite of occasional
delays and disruptions. For example, UNMIL started the disarmament,
demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration programme in November 2003 by
collecting weapons from combatants and opened the first cantonment site on 7
December 2003. However, later in December 2003, the programme had to be
suspended. After its resumption on 20 January 2004, the programme progressed
without major problems or incidents and, as of 2 May 2004, a total of 20,774
combatants have been disarmed, representing approximately 38 per cent of the
caseload (approximately 55,000). A total of 10,981 weapons have been collected,
together with an estimated 3,207,934 rounds of small arms ammunitions, and 7,716
ammunitions of other categories. There are currently four cantonment sites in the
country and contractual agreements are already under way for an additional six sites.
With the progress in disarmament and demobilization parts of the programme, more
attention is being paid to its rehabilitation and reintegration components.

13. With regard to the electoral programme of the Mission, the Advisory
Committee was informed that a two-week needs assessment mission was dispatched
by the Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs during
the month of April 2004, which concluded that the National Elections Commission
of Liberia has very little material and human capacity to carry out civic and voter
education, voter registration, delimitation and polling. According to the Secretariat,
without extensive international assistance, these activities cannot be carried out on
schedule, or in accordance with the parameters set out in the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement. Article XIX of the Agreement provides that elections shall be held no
later than October 2005. The UNAMIL Electoral Unit is expected to play a lead role
in ensuring that the elections in Liberia are held on time, and in conformity with
United Nations standards, hence the proposal to establish an Electoral Division with
staffing and other resources substantially exceeding those of the Electoral Unit (see
para. 24 below).

14. The Committee notes that in response to the recommendations contained in
paragraphs 7 and 8 of its report of 12 November 2003 (A/58/591), the budget
document provides information on the mechanisms for effective collaboration and
coordination with other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and
international partners. The Committee welcomes this information; however, it is
of the view that more needs to be done by the Mission in this area. The
Committee requests that the next budget submission provide information on
further efforts of the Mission in achieving effective collaboration and
coordination with other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and
international partners.

B. Resource requirements

15. As indicated in the budget document, the proposed budget for UNMIL for the
period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 amounts to $839,591,300 (gross).
However, in the course of its deliberation, the Advisory Committee was informed
that this figure should be revised as follows:

United States dollars

Budget as originally proposed in A/58/744 839 591 300

Reduction for troop-rotation travel (8 665 400)

Additional requirements for the electoral programme:

General temporary assistance (4,080 temporary
registration staff for 6 weeks) 1 468 800

Consultants 110 900

Other supplies, services and equipment 1 468 800

Subtotal for the electoral programme 3 229 500

Revised budget (gross) 834 155 400

1. Military and police personnel

Category Approved 2003-2004 Proposed 2004-2005

Military observers 215 215

Military contingents 14 785 14 785

Civilian police 755 755

Formed police units 360 360

16. As shown in paragraph 15 above, the estimates contained in document
A/58/744 have been reduced by $8,665,400 for troop-rotation travel. The Advisory
Committee was informed upon enquiry that the reduced requirements are due to the
projected regional rotation of troops by the B737 aircraft proposed to be acquired in
the 2004/05 financial period, rather than by chartered aircraft.

17. The total provision of $428,170,200 for military and police personnel should
therefore be revised to $419,504,800. The revised total represents an increase of
$219,217,500, or 109.4 per cent, in comparison with the appropriation for the
current period under military and police personnel. According to the Secretary-
General, the increase is due to the full deployment of the military and police
personnel over the 12 months of the budget period, compared to a phased
deployment over 9 months adjusted by a 35 per cent delayed deployment factor in
the 2003/04 period.

18. The Committee notes that the unit cost of rations has decreased from $6.40 per
day to $4.74 as from 1 January 2004. The Committee welcomes this information;
however, it cautions that the reduction in unit cost of rations should not impact



6
A/58/798

adversely on the quality of food. The Committee was informed that staff officers
who were paid mission subsistence allowance in lieu of rations (114 staff officers as
of 30 April 2004) would start to receive rations beginning in August 2004.
Moreover, according to the Secretariat, all military personnel of the Mission would
enjoy hard-wall accommodations during the months of July and August 2004.

19. The Advisory Committee was provided upon request with information on the
status of memorandums of understanding and pre-deployment inspections. The
Committee is concerned that as at the beginning of May 2004, only 3 troop-
contributing countries, out of 20 represented in the Mission, had signed
memorandums of understanding and that pre-deployment inspections had been
conducted in only 5 troop-contributing countries. The Committee requests that
urgent measures be taken to remedy this situation.

20. The budget estimates are based on the following assumption of vacancy rates
for military and police personnel: (i) military observers — 0 per cent; (ii) military
contingents — 2 per cent; (iii) civilian police — 5 per cent; and (iv) formed police
units — 0 per cent. The Advisory Committee observes, in this connection, that the
Mission continues to experience less than full incumbency of military and police
personnel (see para. 5 above). Under the circumstances, the Committee
recommends that the vacancy rates of 5 per cent for military observers and 15
per cent for civilian police be used in the budget estimates. Therefore, the
requirements of $419,504,800 for military and police personnel should be
reduced by $4,823,100 to reflect the delayed deployment factor.

2. Civilian personnel

Category Approved 2003-2004 Proposed 2004-2005 Increase

International staff 607 635 28

National staff 768 798 30

United Nations Volunteers 286 431 145

Recommendations on posts

21. The Advisory Committee notes that, as a partial response to its previous
recommendation (see A/58/591, paras. 16 and 17), UNMIL has carried out an
initial review of the Mission’s organizational structure and has proposed
measures aimed at streamlining the structure. For example, the Mission proposes
to abolish 12 posts (one in substantive and 11 in support areas) and to downgrade
five posts, including one D-2. At the same time the Committee is of the view that
further efforts aimed at streamlining the organizational structure of the
Mission should be made in the context of the more comprehensive review of the
organizational structure planned for mid-2004. In this connection, the
Committee points out that its previous concern about numerous small sections
and units in the organizational structure of UNMIL still remains to be taken
into account by the administration of the Mission (see A/58/591, para. 15). The
Committee intends to monitor developments with regard to the reform of the
organizational structure of UNMIL, including top-level positions.

22. The increase of $118,019,900 in the estimated requirements for civilian
personnel, or 128.5 per cent, compared with the appropriation of $51,655,300 for the



7
A/58/798

current financial period, is attributable mainly to the deployment of the Mission
during the 12 months of the 2004/05 financial period, rather than 9 months during
the current budget period, as well as to the proposed establishment of 203 new posts.
The estimated requirements of $118,019,900 were based on the assumption of 15 per
cent vacancy rates for international staff, National Professional Officers and UNVs
and a 10 per cent vacancy rate for national General Service staff. The Advisory
Committee is of the view that these vacancy rates do not adequately reflect the
delayed recruitment of civilian personnel of UNMIL (see also para. 5 above).
Under the circumstances, the Committee recommends that the estimated
requirements of $118,019,900 for civilian personnel be reduced by $6,811,300,
which would reflect vacancy rates of 20 per cent for international staff,
National Professional Officers and United Nations Volunteers and 15 per cent
for national General Service staff.

23. Besides the abolition and downgrading of posts referred to in paragraph 21
above, the proposed staffing structure of the Mission for the period 2004/05
provides for the following changes:

Additional posts

• 4 posts (1 P-4, 2 P-3 and 1 National Professional Officer) for the Disarmament,
Demobilization, Rehabilitation and Reintegration Section

• 197 posts (1 D-2, 1 D-1, 5 P-4, 15 P-3, 4 Field Service, 5 General Service, 3
National Professional Officers, 15 national staff and 148 United Nations
Volunteers) for the Electoral Division

• 15 posts (all national General Service staff) for the Regional/County Offices

• 2 posts (1 Field Service and 1 national General Service) for the Procurement
Section.

Reclassification of posts

• 1 national General Service post to the National Officer level in the Resource
Mobilization and Trust Fund Programme, Quick-Impact Projects Unit

• 1 national General Service post to international General Service in the
Communications and Information Technology Section

• 1 P-3 post to the P-4 level in the Office of the Director of Administration

• 1 P-3 post to the P-4 level in the Medical Section.

Redeployments

• 26 posts (1 P-4, 1 P-3, 8 Field Service, 12 national General Service and 4
United Nations Volunteers) from Integrated Support Services to Administrative
Services, following the consolidation of the Property Control and Inventory
Unit under the General Services Section

• 1 P-3 post from the Joint Logistics Operations Centre to the Supply Section.

24. The Advisory Committee notes that the bulk of the requests for additional
posts relates to the electoral programme of the Mission and the related establishment
of the Electoral Division as an outgrowth of the current Electoral Advisory Unit.



8
A/58/798

The additional 197 posts for the Division would be augmented by 4,080 temporary
registration staff to be engaged for six weeks, for which a provision of $1,468,800 is
requested under general temporary assistance (see para. 15 above). In this
connection, the Committee recalls its previous observation that while “the Mission
intends to expand the Unit in the next budget period as elections draw nearer, it
emphasizes that planning for the elections should be done well in advance”. The
Committee was informed by the representative of the Secretary-General that
additional personnel for the electoral programme would be hired in a staggered
manner during the preparation for and holding of the elections and would be
released in a similar staggered manner as the need for electoral support diminishes.
The Secretariat estimates the total cost of the Mission’s electoral programme at $20
million for the financial period 2004/05. Annex II below contains additional
information on the estimate.

25. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-
General’s staffing proposals for UNMIL. In this connection, it should be pointed
out that three posts of Resident Auditors at UNMIL (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 1 General
Service/Other level) are not included in the Mission’s staffing table since, as a
standard procedure, posts of Resident Auditors are budgeted under the Support
Account for peacekeeping operations.

3. Operational costs

Variance

Apportioned 2003/04 Proposed 2004/05 Amount Percentage

$312 551 700 $296 630 700 ($15 921 000) (5.1)

26. While the overall requirements under operational costs show a net decrease,
the proposed budget reflects growth in resource requirements under a number of
budget lines, such as consultants, official travel, air transportation, communications,
medical and special equipment.

Consultants

27. The requirements for consultants for 2004/05 shown in section II.1 of the
proposed budget ($689,400) have subsequently been increased by $110,900 (see
para. 15 above) to a total of $800,300. This represents an increase of $345,900, or
76.1 per cent, compared with the appropriation of $454,400 for the current period.
As explained by the Secretariat, the increased requirements result mainly from the
need to conduct reviews and workshops in the area of judicial reform and legal
education and to implement consulting projects which were budgeted in 2002/04 but
had to be rolled over to 2004/05 as they cannot be conducted in 2003/04. The
Advisory Committee was informed that the $454,400 would be reflected as savings
in the performance report for the current financial period. A provision of $110,900 is
requested for the electoral programme.

28. The Advisory Committee points out that the presentation of resource
requirements for consultants needs to be significantly improved. The requested
resources should be explained and justified in terms of programmatic needs.
Projects to be implemented by consultants should be clearly and directly linked



9
A/58/798

to outputs and achievements programmed by the Mission. The Committee
points out that in the absence of such detailed justification, it was not in a
position to ascertain whether the entire requested provision of $800,300 was
necessary. Therefore, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the
amount of the rollover from the current financial period ($454,400) and
$110,900 for the electoral programme, i.e., a reduction of $235,000 to the
requested amount of $800,300.

Official travel

29. The estimate for official travel for 2004/05, as shown in section II.1 of the
proposed budget, amounts to $2,276,900, an increase of $296,000, or 14.9 per cent,
compared with the amount of $1,980,900 apportioned for 2003/04. The total of
$2,276,900 reflects a provision of $852,400 for training-related travel, an increase of
$252,400 compared with the apportionment for the period 2003/04, and a provision
of $1,424,500 for other official travel, an increase of $43,600 compared with the
apportionment for the period 2003/04. As explained in paragraph 17 of the budget
document, the additional requirements result mainly from the full deployment of
civilian personnel over the 12 months of the budget period, compared to a phased
deployment in the 2003/04 budget.

30. The Committee is of the view that the proposed increase in travel
requirements cannot be justified simply by the anticipated higher level of
civilian personnel; the travel programme of the Mission should better
demonstrate its relationship with and impact on outputs and achievements
planned for the Mission. The Committee questions, for example, the usefulness
and effectiveness of undertaking 20 trips (of 7 days’ duration each) to New
York for increasing awareness and understanding of political factors affecting
Liberia (for an estimated cost of $160,500); another 13 trips (of 7 days’
duration each) to New York are planned on administrative matters (for an
estimated cost of $136,200). The Committee is of the view that the Mission
should rely more on available communications and information technology and
reduce its travel programme accordingly. The Committee recommends a
reduction of $300,000 from the requested provision of $2,276,900 and trusts
that the necessary measures will be taken by the administration of UNMIL and
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to ensure the efficient use and
effective control of travel expenditures of the Mission.

Air transportation

31. The estimate for air transportation for the period ending 30 June 2005 amounts
to $74,228,100, an increase of $8,800,100, or 13.5 per cent, in relation to the
appropriation for the current period. The increase is mainly due to the higher
number of contracted flight hours and the projected replacement of the high-speed
medium-range aircraft and the IL-76 by a DHC7 and a B737. The Advisory
Committee was informed that the replacement would enhance the Mission’s capacity
to airlift contingents and equipment and reduce its reliance on chartered aircraft,
which should result in savings in emplacement cost (see para. 16 above). The
Committee welcomes this approach.

A/58/798

Financial arrangements for UNMIL for the period from 1 August 2003 to
30 June 2004

32. In his note on the financial arrangements for UNMIL for the period from
1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004 (A/58/792 of 12 May 2004), the Secretary-General
indicates that the budget of the Mission for the current financial period would be
fully implemented. The General Assembly, in its resolution 58/261 of 23 December
2003 on the financing of UNMIL appropriated the amount of $564,494,300 and
apportioned among Member States the amount of $450,000,000, i.e. $114,494,300
less than the appropriation. In his note of 12 May 2004 (A/58/792), the Secretary-
General requested that the General Assembly apportion among Member States the
additional amount of $114,494,300 for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June
2004.

III. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

33. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of UNMIL for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 is indicated in
paragraph 27 of the proposed budget (A/58/744). In view of its comments above,
the Advisory Committee recommends that the estimated budget requirement be
reduced from $834,155,400 to $821,986,000.

34. The Committee expects the next budget submission for UNMIL to fully
reflect the results of a comprehensive review of the Mission’s organizational
structure as called for in paragraph 21 above.

35. With regard to the request in document A/58/792, it is for the General
Assembly to decide on the level of assessment for UNMIL. The Advisory
Committee has provided information on payments received in respect of
UNMIL in paragraph 3 above. It seems fortuitous that the projection of total
requirements for UNMIL exactly matches the total level of the appropriation
for 2003/04 (see also para. 8 above). The Committee reiterates the view, which
it has expressed several times in the past, that increasing the level of assessment
is not a solution to the problem of unpaid contributions.
