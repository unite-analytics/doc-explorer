Admission of the International Criminal Court to
membership in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the note by the Secretary-General on Admission of the International
Criminal Court to membership in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund
(A/C.5/58/13).

2. The Advisory Committee notes that the Standing Committee of the United
Nations Joint Staff Pension Board has, by consensus, decided to recommend to the
General Assembly that it approve the application of the International Criminal Court
for membership in the Pension Fund, effective as from 1 January 2004.

3. The Advisory Committee notes further that, according to the Chief Executive
Officer of the Pension Fund, the conditions of service for staff of the International
Criminal Court have been aligned with those prevailing in the United Nations
common system and thus conformed with the “common system of salaries,
allowances and other conditions of service of the United Nations and the specialized
agencies” (ibid., annex, para. 3).

4. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General
Assembly approve the recommendation of the Standing Committee of the
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Board with regard to the application of the
International Criminal Court for membership in the United Nations Joint Staff
Pension Fund.
