I. Introduction

3. The Committee recalls that the General Assembly, on the recommendation of
the Advisory Committee (see A/58/809), authorized commitment authority with
assessment of the amount of $49,259,800, approved by the Advisory Committee
under the terms of section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of
23 December 1994, for the establishment of the Mission (for the period from 1 May
to 30 June 2004), and of an amount of $172,480,500 for the period from 1 July to
31 October 2004 (see General Assembly resolution 58/311 of 18 June 2004).

4. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that, of the amount apportioned
for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004, expenditures amounted to $34,556,000.
For the period from 1 July to 31 October 2004, expenditures, with the exclusion of
field expenditures, amounted to $57,794,900, as at 23 September 2004.

5. The Advisory Committee was provided with the following table showing
incumbency as at 31 August 2004:

Category of personnel Authorized/proposeda Incumbered

Military contingents 6 700 2 761

Civilian police 872 320

Formed police units 750 -

International staff 482 191

National staff 549 334

United Nations Volunteers 153 50

a Represents the highest authorized/proposed strength for the period.

II. Proposed budget for the period from 1 May 2004
to 30 June 2005

A. Mandate and planned results

6. The Advisory Committee commends the results-based budget presentation for
MINUSTAH for 2004/05. The Committee is of the opinion, however, that there is
room for further improvement, particularly as regards the measurability of
indicators of achievement and the refinement of external factors.

7. The Committee notes that the overall objective of the Mission is to restore
peace and security and to further the constitutional political process under way in
Haiti. Furthermore, on the basis of the specific mandate of the Mission, as provided
in paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 1542 (2004) of 30 April 2004, and the
supporting activities identified in the Secretary-General’s report on Haiti
(S/2004/300), five components are outlined, with specific expected
accomplishments and related indicators of achievement and outputs: (i) secure and
stable environment, (ii) political process, (iii) human rights, (iv) humanitarian and
development coordination and (v) support.

8. The structure proposed for the Mission is discussed in paragraphs 17 to 26
below. The Committee notes that the Mission will establish offices in the 10



3
A/59/390

geographical districts, consisting of the Mission Headquarters in Port-au-Prince,
three regional headquarters and six district offices (see A/59/288, para. 6).

B. Resource requirements

9. The proposed budget for MINUSTAH of $428,306,600 contained in the report
of the Secretary-General (A/59/288) comprises the commitment authority of
$49,259,800 granted by the Advisory Committee for the establishment of the
Mission for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004 (see para. 3 above) and resource
requirements in the amount of $379,046,800 proposed for the period from 1 July
2004 to 30 June 2005.

1. Military and police personnel

Category Authorized/proposed 2004/05

Military contingentsa 6 700

Civilian policea 872

Formed police unitsa 750

a Represents highest level of authorized/proposed strength.

10. The provision proposed for military and police personnel amounts to
$204,401,900 (including $12,603,700 for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004).
The requirement of $148,850,200 for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005
with respect to military contingents provides for the phased deployment of 5,844
military contingent personnel, with the full authorized strength expected to be
attained in the period 2005/06. A 10 per cent delayed deployment factor has been
applied. The Committee notes that at the time of its hearings, a total of 2,770 troops
were deployed throughout the mission area, compared to the projected deployment
schedule, according to which 4,947 troops were supposed to have been deployed by
the end of August 2004. The Committee was informed that the delays were due to
discussions relating to the memorandums of understanding and requests for
evaluation teams in some cases. However, the deployed operational contingents
from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay were expected to be joined by troops
from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Peru, Spain and Morocco. In view of the evident delays,
the Committee recommends that the delayed deployment factor for military
contingents be adjusted to a more realistic rate of 15 per cent. The impact on the
budget would be a reduction of $5,927,400.

11. The Advisory Committee notes that provision is made for $17,664,200 for
rations, at a cost of $8.40 per day per person, whereas in the United Nations Mission
in Liberia (UNMIL) and the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (MONUC) their cost has been closer to $5 to $6 range. The
Committee requested an explanation for the variance and was informed that since
the time of preparation of the budget, a rations contract had been signed that
reflected an actual cost of $7 per day per person, thus reducing requirements for
expenditures on rations by $2,270,400. The Committee requests that efforts be
made to reduce future costs so that they would be more in line with those of
other missions.

A/59/390

12. The estimated requirements for civilian police amount to $26,136,700 for the
period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, based on a phased deployment of 872
police officers, reflecting a 40 per cent delayed deployment factor. At the time of its
hearings, the Committee was informed that 429 civilian police had been deployed
and that the delays in deployment were mostly due to the language requirements.

13. Provision of $16,811,300 for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 is
also made for the costs of 750 formed unit police, to be deployed in 6 teams of 125
officers each, reflecting a 30 per cent delayed deployment factor. At the time of its
hearings, the Committee was informed that a Jordanian team of 125 formed unit
police was already present, and that a Chinese team (30 formed unit police) and a
team from Nepal (6 formed unit police) were expected before the end of September.

2. Civilian personnel

Category Proposed 2004/05

International staff 482

National staffa 549

United Nations Volunteers 153

a Includes National Officers and national General Service staff.

14. The estimated requirements for civilian personnel for the period from 1 May
2004 to 30 June 2005 amount to $62,877,400 ($3,767,200 for the period from 1 May
to 30 June 2004 and $59,110,200 for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005).
They provide for a staffing establishment of 1,184 personnel, consisting of 482
international personnel, 549 national staff and 153 United Nations Volunteers.

15. The related staff costs include a delayed deployment factor of 35 per cent for
international staff, 45 per cent for national staff and 30 per cent for United Nations
Volunteers. The Committee was informed that the process of recruitment of local
staff had been initiated with the advertisement of 551 posts, for which 14,100
applications had been received. At the time of the Committee’s hearings, 482 local
staff had been approved by the local Appointments and Postings Committee and
recommendations for 69 National Officers had been referred to the Personnel
Management and Support Service of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for
final endorsement. The Committee was also assured that approximately 50 per cent
of the international staff had been recruited and were on travel status. The
Committee believes that the deployment factor for national staff, which will
most certainly result in over-expenditures under that budget line in view of the
timely recruitment, may be offset by the delays in the deployment of
international staff. This should be reported in the context of the performance
report.

16. The Committee encourages greater use of national staff, where possible, as
has been requested by the Committee and the General Assembly in the past,
particularly in the area of administration, where, the Committee was informed,
in view of the advertisement and recruitment efforts locally, a skilled workforce
had been identified.

A/59/390

Structure of the Mission

17. The Committee was informed that MINUSTAH is organized as a
“multidimensional and integrated mission in order to enable it to respond to the
various needs in accordance with the mandate provided by the Security Council”.
The Committee notes from the organizational chart, that under the leadership of the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the structure of the Mission is
comprised of two main areas or pillars: a civilian affairs pillar, headed by a
Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, which includes
sections concerned with justice, human rights, security, the police, civil affairs and
electoral assistance; and a humanitarian affairs and development pillar, headed by a
Deputy Special Representative, who is also the Resident Coordinator, concerned
with disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, humanitarian and development
coordination, child protection, gender issues and HIV/AIDS.

18. In addition to the two Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General
mentioned above, the Force Commander, responsible for the development of the
concept of operations, deployment and all military activities, and the Chief
Administrative Officer, who heads the support component of the mission, report
directly to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.2 The Office of the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General also has a direct link to the Political
Affairs and Planning Division, the Legal Affairs Section, the Office of the Resident
Auditor and the Communications and Public Information Section.

19. The Advisory Committee had an exchange of views with representatives of the
Secretary-General on what appears to be the application of a structure with certain
commonalities in such missions as MINUSTAH, the United Nations Operation in
Burundi (ONUB), the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) and
UNMIL. The Committee had previously referred to an earlier form of such a
structure in its report on the financing of UNOCI (A/58/806, paras. 26-29), as well
as its reports on UNMIL (A58/591, paras. 15-17) and MONUC (A/58/447, paras.
30-37). In the case of UNOCI, the Committee pointed out the “fragmented and top-
heavy” structure and recommended that a review be undertaken with a view to
“streamlining the structure by combining smaller units or integrating them into
larger sections and eliminating some posts for heads of units and other higher-level
posts, including in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
and the Deputy Special Representatives”. In the case of MONUC and UNMIL, the
Committee has called attention to the proliferation of small sections and units with
chiefs at the P-4 and P-5 level, overseeing small numbers of staff, which tends to
inflate the grade structure and lead to a duplication of functions.

20. The Committee was informed that the structure now being proposed has
evolved as a follow-up to the Brahimi report, in response to the multidimensional
character of recent operations, which reflect the changes in the nature of the
problems or conflicts in which the Organization is now called to play a role, as well
as lessons learned. However, this structure or model, which is being applied on an
experimental basis, is not rigid; it can be adapted to the specificities and
complexities of each mission and will be adjusted to adapt to changes in mandates.

__________________
2 The budget document (A/59/288) indicates that the Chief Administrative Officer reports to the

Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General. During the Committee’s
consideration of the Secretary-General’s report, the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General indicated that current arrangements provide for direct reporting.



6
A/59/390

In complex missions, a Principal Deputy would relieve the Special Representative
from the day-to-day management tasks of the operation, while allowing a second
Deputy, usually the resident representative, to concentrate on the coordination of
humanitarian and development affairs, thus ensuring an integrated and coordinated
approach which would involve the rest of the United Nations system from the onset
of the missions. This second deputy is thus, in many cases, assigned a role in
mobilizing required resources related to disarmament, demobilization, repatriation,
resettlement and reintegration activities and ensuring the emplacement of a
sustainable exit strategy.

21. The Committee appreciates the work that has been done so far, but it is of
the opinion that the concerns indicated in paragraph 19 above have not been
fully addressed, particularly with regard to the need to avoid fragmentation, to
establish clear lines of authority and to avoid the potential for grade inflation.

22. Consistent with the views expressed in its report on ONUCI (A/58/806),
the Committee recommends that the level of the Deputy Special Representative
(Humanitarian and development coordination), which is given at the Assistant
Secretary-General level in the common structure now being put forward, be
considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the existing grade of the
Resident Coordinator and in consultation with the funds and programmes
represented in the mission area. It is the view of the Committee that, unless a
clear case based on function and responsibility is made otherwise, this post
should normally be established at the D-2 level. Moreover, it is the
understanding of the Committee that this post would usually be funded by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), up to the grade level of the
existing Resident Coordinator; any difference would be paid by the mission
concerned. In this connection, the Committee was informed that this
arrangement will be reflected in the next budget of MINUSTAH. This funding
arrangement should be applied to other missions.

23. The Committee notes that there is direct reporting to the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General of certain units such as those of legal
affairs, public information and communications and political affairs in this Mission,
as well as in UNMIL, MONUC and the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The Committee was assured that this responds to
lessons learned and reflects the direct support to some of the functions of the
Special Representatives in these multidimensional missions. The Committee
cautions, however, against a tendency to replicate functions of the Mission itself
in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General or the
Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General. The aim should be to
increase efficiency and accountability and to improve management; it should
not result in an increase in the number of posts or the grade level of the posts
proposed either in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General or in other units.

24. In the case of MINUSTAH, the Division of Administration currently also
reports directly to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, as indicated
in paragraph 18 above. The Advisory Committee questioned this line of reporting in
the case of ONUCI (see A/58/806). The Committee is of the opinion that the
reporting function of the Division of Administration should be carried out
through the Principal Deputy of the Special Representative of the Secretary-



7
A/59/390

General, thus ensuring a system of checks and balances for all elements of the
Mission.

25. The Committee also cautions against the duplication of functions in
different units or a tendency to fragment functions into very specialized units,
particularly where resources could, more efficiently, be pooled or merged, as is
the case with the Child Protection, Gender and HIV/AIDS Units. In addition, the
Committee notes that the Security Section in MINUSTAH is currently placed under
the pillar of the Principal Deputy Special Representative. The Committee points
out, however, that the reporting lines of security responsibility may shift or be
adjusted after a decision is taken on the Secretary-General’s comprehensive
report on security to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.

26. While the Committee is aware of the need for flexibility in the model
structure being applied on an experimental basis to these complex missions, the
Committee recommends that an evaluation of that structure, on the basis of
experience in these missions, be provided in the context of the submission of the
peacekeeping budgets for the period 2005/06.

Recommendations on posts

27. In view of the paragraphs above, the Advisory Committee makes the
following recommendations for adjustments regarding the staffing
establishment in MINUSTAH:

• In the Office of the Special Representative, the post of the Director,
proposed at the D-1 level, should be at the P-5 level and the Director
should be assisted by a P-3, instead of a P-4. The Committee does not see
the need for a Special Assistant (P-5) or a Protocol Officer (P-4); the latter
functions can be carried out by the P-3. In view of the proximity of the
Political Affairs and Planning Division to this office, the Committee does
not see the need for a Political Affairs Officer (P-4).

• The level of the Deputy Special Representative for Humanitarian and
Development Coordination should be set at the D-2 level (see para. 22
above). For the reasons given in paragraph 23 above, one P-5 and one P-4
post in the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-
General should be eliminated owing to duplication of functions with other
units reporting to this Deputy.

• Both the Legal Affairs Section and the Communications and Public
Information Section should be headed at the P-5 instead of the D-1 level,
in view of the available support from Headquarters. In both sections this
should be achieved through the elimination of the D-1 post. The head of
the Communications and Public Information Section could also act as
spokesperson.

• The level of the post of the head of the Political Affairs and Planning
Division should be reclassified downward from D-2 to D-1.

These recommendations are made on the understanding that the staffing of
MINUSTAH would be revisited in the light of the evaluation called for in
paragraph 26 above. The impact on the budget would be a reduction of
$1,114,600.

A/59/390

3. Operational costs

28. The proposed operational costs for MINUSTAH are $161,027,300. Of this
total, an amount of $29,000,000 constitutes the replacement cost of equipment
transferred from the strategic deployment stocks at the United Nations Logistics
Base in Brindisi since 1 May 2004.

29. The Committee notes a provision of $64,056,600 under facilities and
infrastructure (including $9,980,200 for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004).
The resources provide for the acquisition of prefabricated facilities ($20,067,100)
and the reimbursement for self-sustainment of the military contingents and the
formed police units ($13,973,200), as well as $3,387,000 for site construction and
the upgrading of roads, airports and seaports. The Committee also notes an amount
of $2,027,200 for requirements for water treatment and bottling plants, of which
$1,839,800 relates to the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The Committee
expects that once completed, this should lead to savings in the amount budgeted
for the supply of bottled water.

30. The proposed requirements under communications amount to $24,503,700 for
the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005. This would cover acquisition costs for
communications equipment related to the establishment of the Mission’s
communications network, requirements related to commercial communications,
specialized technical support and the self-sustainment of the military contingents
and the formed police units, including the replacement cost of equipment transferred
from the strategic deployment stocks at the United Nations Logistics Base
($1,901,900) and an amount of $373,800 for the acquisition of public information
equipment.

31. An amount of $11,695,100, for the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005,
is proposed for information technology requirements, reflecting total acquisition
costs for equipment of $9,083,700, including $712,500 in replacement costs for
equipment transferred from the strategic deployment stocks.

32. The Advisory Committee recommends that requests for resources for
communications, information technology, and facilities and infrastructure
include a time frame for the completion of projects and that the status of
implementation of tasks undertaken be reflected in the performance report (see
also A/57/772, para. 102).

33. The requirements of $24,842,800 for the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June
2005 under ground transportation provide for the operation and maintenance of a
fleet of 764 vehicles. The purchase cost for the fleet of $19,201,800 includes an
amount of $11,686,250 for the replacement cost of 468 vehicles transferred from the
strategic deployment stocks at the United Nations Logistics Base. It also includes a
provision for spare parts ($476,300). The Committee requested clarification as to
the level of the provision for spare parts. The Committee was informed that the
established practice is to make provision for the acquisition of certain critical spare
parts in view of delays in getting equipment repaired under warranty or in obtaining
replacement parts from the supplier. While, in established missions, spare parts and
supplies are estimated at a standard rate of 10 per cent, in the case of MINUSTAH,
where most of the equipment is new, they are estimated at 5 per cent.

A/59/390

Electoral assistance

34. In its resolution 1542 (2004) the Security Council called upon the Mission to
assist the Transitional Government in its efforts to organize, monitor and carry out
municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections “at the earliest possible date”.
The Committee was informed that the Transitional Government is aiming to hold
elections in the middle and at the end of next year. The Advisory Committee notes
that the Electoral Assistance Section is responsible for the related tasks (A/59/288,
para. 40), thus contributing to expected accomplishment 2.3 and supporting the
related outputs in component 2 of the results-based framework of MINUSTAH. The
related resources consist of 23 staff (8 international, 2 national and 13 United
Nations Volunteers). The Committee was also informed that additional staff were
not envisaged for this purpose, in view of the fact that the Section has been involved
in the process since the start and the monitoring activities would be carried out by
other entities.

Quick-impact projects

35. Resources amounting to $1,000,000 are included in the budget for quick-
impact projects, of which $970,000 relate to the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June
2005 for the requirements of 20 projects in support of civil society initiatives and
public institutions, facilitating United Nations peacekeeping efforts. The Committee
was informed that 300 submissions had been received, of which 83 projects had
been evaluated and 31 had been approved.

III. Conclusions of the Advisory Committee

36. The Advisory Committee, taking into account its observations and
recommendations in the paragraphs above, is of the opinion that a reduction of
$9,312,400 is possible. During its consideration of the Secretary-General’s
estimates, the Advisory Committee inquired as to the effects of Hurricane
Jeanne on the conduct of the Mission. The Advisory Committee was informed
that the impact is significant both upon the facilities and infrastructure of the
Mission itself and with regard to the additional tasks the Mission is being called
upon to perform in relation to humanitarian assistance and security for food
distribution. The Committee was further informed, however, that it is not the
intention of the Secretary-General to request additional resources at this time.
Bearing the foregoing in mind, the Advisory Committee is recommending
appropriation of the full amount requested by the Secretary-General,
notwithstanding the adjustment in respect of the delayed deployment factor
(see para. 10 above), the cost of rations (see para. 11 above) and the
Committee’s views on the staffing of the Mission and the numbers and levels of
posts required ( see para. 27 above). The financial impact of Hurricane Jeanne
on the mission should be disclosed in the relevant performance report for
MINUSTAH.
