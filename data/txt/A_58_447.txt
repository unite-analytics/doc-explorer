Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Proposed budget for the United Nations Organization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the
period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004

Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

I. Introduction

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has
considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed budget for the
United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUC) for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (A/58/381). During its
consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-
General, who provided additional information and clarifications.

2. At its winter 2003 session, the Advisory Committee had before it proposed
initial and revised budgets for MONUC for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June
2004 (A/57/683 and Add.1). However, as noted in paragraph 3 of its report
(A/57/772/Add.10) on those documents, the Committee was informed that the
Secretary-General would submit a report to the Security Council in May 2003 that
would contain recommendations for an expanded role and new tasks for MONUC
and that a new budget would be submitted for consideration that would reflect such
action as the Council might take. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that the
budget be maintained at $582 million and that the staffing table be maintained at
1,695 posts pending action by the Council and the submission of a new budget. The
Committee also annexed detailed observations and recommendations to its report to
be taken into account in the preparation of the new budget for 2003/04.

3. The mandate of MONUC is contained in paragraph 7 of Security Council
resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000. In that resolution, the Council
authorized the expansion of MONUC to consist of up to 5,537 military personnel,
including up to 500 military observers or more, as deemed necessary by the
Secretary-General. Subsequently, in its resolution 1445 (2002) of 4 December 2002,



2
A/58/447

the Council authorized the expansion of MONUC to consist of up to 8,700 military
personnel, principally comprising two task forces, to be deployed in phases. By its
resolution 1493 (2003) of 28 July 2003, the Security Council expanded the mandate
of MONUC and extended it to 30 July 2004. The Council also noted with
appreciation the recommendations contained in the second special report of the
Secretary-General on MONUC of 27 May 2003 (S/2003/566 and Corr.1) and
authorized an increase in the military strength of MONUC to 10,800 personnel.

4. The proposed new budget for MONUC for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30
June 2004 (A/58/381) was prepared on the basis of the mandate of the Security
Council in its resolution 1493 (2003). The Advisory Committee notes, as indicated
in the summary of the proposed new budget, that the new estimates supersede the
budgetary proposals contained in the previous reports of the Secretary-General on
the financing of MONUC (A/57/683 and Add.1). The Committee has examined the
estimates in the light of developments since the submission in May of its report on
the previous estimates (A/57/772/Add.10).

II.  Information on performance

5. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 30 September 2003, a total
of $1,533,940,600 had been assessed on Member States in respect of MONUC since
its inception. Payments received as at the same date amounted to $1,294,754,200
leaving an outstanding balance of $239,186,400. The cash position of the Mission as
at that date was $249,900,000, and unliquidated obligations for the period from 1
July 2003 to 30 June 2004 amounted to $227,983,100.

6. The Advisory Committee was also informed that cost reimbursements for
troops and formed police up to 24 September 2003 totalled $98,654,300, while the
amount owed for the month of August was $7,321,400. With regard to contingent-
owned equipment, the Committee was informed that, as at 24 September, an amount
of $15,972,300 had been reimbursed, and the amount owed up to 31 August was
$52,892,900, while unliquidated obligations totalled $68,646,300. In respect of
death and disability compensation, $261,000 had been paid as at 24 September for
six claims, two claims were pending and unliquidated obligations amounted to
$2,877,700.

7. The Advisory Committee was provided with the following incumbency
statistics for MONUC as at 30 September 2003:

A/58/447

8. The Advisory Committee was also provided with expenditure data for the
period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. Expenditures for the period as at 30
September 2003 amounted to $274,757,300 gross. Expenditures consisted of
disbursements of $46,774,200 and unliquidated obligations of $227,983,100 against
an apportionment of $582 million. The Committee has expressed concern in the
past about the need to monitor obligations; high levels of unliquidated
obligations can be signs of a lack of proper planning and control (see also
A/57/772/Add.10, annex, para. 7).

III. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2003
to 30 June 2004

A. General comments

9. The Advisory Committee commends the Secretariat for its attempt to
prepare the estimates using results-based-budgeting techniques and encourages
further improvement, taking into account the views expressed by the
Committee in its previous reports on peacekeeping operations (A/57/772 and
Add.10).

10. The Advisory Committee welcomes the information provided in section V
of the new proposed budget report concerning follow-up action taken to
implement requests and recommendations of the Committee, but notes also that
the observations of the Committee are not fully covered therein and considers
that some of the responses are inadequate (see, e.g., paras. 12 and 13 below).
The Committee recognizes that there has not been enough time to implement all of
its recommendations and that many of them will have to be addressed in the context
of the next budget estimate after budget performance results are available. The
observations of the Committee contained in its general report on peacekeeping
operations (A/57/772) and in its report on the financing of MONUC
(A/57/772/Add.10) remain valid and have been taken into account in the
recommendations set out in the present report.

11. In future, the Advisory Committee recommends that information on
action taken to implement the Committee’s recommendations be incorporated
into the narrative of the budget document and that section V be refashioned
into an index that would serve as a guide to the relevant section of the
narrative.

12. The Advisory Committee reiterates its observation that there has been a
continuing and serious trend of overbudgeting for the Mission, despite the
reductions recommended by the Committee (see A/57/772/Add.10, annex,
para. 5). Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with expenditure
data for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 (see annex below). As
indicated, expenditure for the period amounted to $479,952,000 gross against an
apportionment of $581,933,500 gross, an underexpenditure of nearly $102 million.
The Committee recalls that, in the original budget submission for that period,
requirements were estimated at $603,911,000 gross (see A/56/897, table 1), which
the Committee recommended reducing by $21,977,536 gross to $581,933,464
(see A/56/887/Add.11, para. 74). The expenditure of $479,952,000 is therefore
$123,959,000, or approximately 20.5 per cent, less than the amount initially



4
A/58/447

estimated for the period. Similarly, as noted previously by the Committee
(see A/57/772/Add.10, annex, para. 3), the original budget proposal for the 2001/02
period was $537.1 million gross. The Committee recommended an appropriation of
$450 million gross (see A/56/845, para. 83), or a reduction of $87.1 million.
Expenditure for the period amounted to $388.8 million, approximately $148 million,
or 28 per cent, less than the amount initially estimated.

13. Furthermore, although the issue of overbudgeting is addressed in
section V of the proposed budget, the Advisory Committee does not consider
the response adequate. There is an indication that a review has been
undertaken, but no specific information is provided concerning the results of
the review or specific action taken in response to those results.

B. Resource requirements

14. As indicated in the proposed budget for MONUC, resource requirements for
the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 are estimated at $675,038,300 gross
($661,771,300 net), excluding voluntary contributions in kind in the amount of
$2,274,000 (see A/58/381, sect. II.A). The estimate represents an increase of
$93,104,800, or 16 per cent, in gross terms in relation to the apportionment for the
period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 and an increase of $40,269,400 over the
initial estimates submitted for the current period (see sect. II.A.1 of A/57/683 and
A/57/683/Add.1). The estimate includes increases of $77,767,000, or 41 per cent,
for military and police personnel; $11,628,200, or 11.9 per cent, for civilian
personnel; and $3,709,600, or 1.3 per cent, for operational costs.

15. The estimate provides for 760 military observers, 10,040 military contingents,
182 civilian police, 938 international staff, 1,299 national staff and 419 United
Nations Volunteers.

1. Military and police personnel

16. The Advisory Committee was provided with a table showing the status of
expenditure for MONUC for the period 2003/04 as at 24 September 2003, which
showed expenditures of $31.4 million out of the $227.7 million apportioned under
military and civilian police personnel. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed
that the $31.4 million did not reflect the full picture, as it did not include fully
obligated amounts for troop costs. The Committee was subsequently provided with a
replacement table showing expenditure as at 30 September, which did include the
fully obligated amounts for troop costs, bringing the level of expenditure to
$151,460,900. The Committee expresses concern that incomplete information
can hinder its examination of the estimates in a timely manner and its
formulation of recommendations based on facts. The Committee insists that it
be provided in future with the most up-to-date expenditure and obligation
information so that it may examine the estimates without requesting further
clarification.

17. The estimate of $266,930,300 for military and police personnel costs
represents an increase of 41.1 per cent ($77,767,000) over the appropriation of
$189,163,300 for the 2002/03 period. The variance is due to the increase, in
accordance with Security Council resolution 1493 (2003), in the number of military
and police personnel from 5,637, including 100 civilian police (the number that had



5
A/58/447

been authorized by the Council, in its resolution 1291 (2000), when the 2002/03
budget for MONUC was approved), to 10,982, including 182 civilian police,
authorized for 2003/04 (see A/58/381, sect. II.B.1).

18. The Advisory Committee was informed that it was the intention of the
Secretary-General to deploy military personnel to full strength by 30 June 2004. As
at 30 September 2003, 8,794 military personnel and 81 civilian police were on board
(see para. 7 above). The Committee notes that the delayed deployment rate for
military contingents is currently 20 per cent. The Committee was informed that a
delayed deployment factor of 25 per cent had been applied for a number of cost
elements in respect of military contingent personnel, including troop cost
reimbursement, recreational leave allowance, daily allowance, rations and
reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment.

19. In the experience of the Advisory Committee, however, projected deployment
rates for MONUC have traditionally proven optimistic when compared with actual
implementation rates. The Committee therefore doubts that the full additional
amount of $77.7 million will be needed before the end of June 2004. It is also
the experience of the Committee that, while the reimbursement of military and
equipment costs is fully obligated during the financial period, for a variety of
reasons, savings are traditionally realized in amounts previously obligated (see,
e.g., A/57/772, paras. 60-76, regarding the management of contingent-owned
equipment arrangements).

20. The estimate for military observers amounts to $41,393,500, a decrease of
$7,187,900, or 14.8 per cent, in comparison with the apportionment for the 2002/03
period. The decrease is due to the reduction in the number of military observers
from 810 to 760. The Advisory Committee was informed that no delayed
deployment factor had been applied for military observers; however, incumbency as
at 30 September 2003 was 746, for an actual delayed deployment rate of 2 per cent.

21. The cost estimate for travel related to the emplacement, rotation and
repatriation of military and police personnel amounts to approximately $29 million.
The overall increase of $3,740,700 under this item, in comparison with the
apportionment for 2002/03, includes an increase of $7,743,900 for military
contingents, offset in part by decreases of $3,973,100 for military observers and
$30,100 for civilian police. The decrease for military observers is due to the
decrease in the number of observers from 810 to 760. The Advisory Committee
enquired as to the extent to which it would be possible to transport troops that come
from the region using United Nations-owned aircraft rather than charter aircraft. The
Committee was informed that at present the Mission had only one fixed-wing
passenger aircraft that would be suitable for troop movements outside of the mission
area and that the use of that aircraft for such purposes would be at the expense of
internal support operations. However, the Mission’s aircraft fleet is to be expanded
shortly through the contracting of additional fixed-wing passenger aircraft, which
would increase the capacity of the Mission to take on such flights. The Committee
requests the Mission to explore this possibility.

22. The estimate for rations amounts to $17,340,800, an increase of $4,166,300
over the apportionment for 2002/03. The variance is based on the increase in the
number of contingent personnel to 10,040 and a delayed deployment factor of 25 per
cent. In its previous report on MONUC, the Advisory Committee commented in
some detail on the issue of delivery of rations. It had been informed of an additional



6
A/58/447

requirement of $7.2 million in connection with the use of the contractor’s aircraft to
distribute rations.1 The Committee had requested the Secretariat to consider possible
alternatives to this arrangement and to properly justify the results in the new budget
submission for MONUC (see A/57/772/Add.10, annex, paras. 25 and 26). The
proposed budget (A/58/381) contains no information on follow-up to the
Committee’s recommendations on this issue. The Committee understands that
MONUC is currently delivering rations. The Committee was informed that, as a
consequence of the increase in the authorized troop strength, the reconfiguration of
the deployment of military contingents and the projected opening of a third
warehouse, in Uganda, the results of a previously undertaken cost-benefit analysis
were no longer valid. The Mission intends to conduct a new cost-benefit analysis
upon receipt of a new proposal from the contractor. It was explained to the
Committee that a number of considerations would be taken into account apart from
the cost. Among these were the advantage of having the contractor assume all
operational risks, such as food spoilage and subsequent replacement or
replenishment, the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain management and
possible additional air capacity freed up for use by the Mission.

23. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 84 of the proposed budget that
one P-3 post and one national staff post have been budgeted to coordinate the
distribution of rations to contingents from the contractor’s warehouse in Kigoma,
United Republic of Tanzania. The Committee requested information concerning the
possibility of having rations delivered directly to troop location sites rather than to
warehouses, which are owned by the contractor. The Committee was informed that
the cost of operating the warehouses was included in the contract for rations. The
Committee was also informed that the results of the original cost-benefit analysis
mentioned above indicated that the delivery of rations to troop locations from two
warehouses, in Kinshasa and Kigoma, would result in annual savings for the
Organization ranging from $1.1 million to $2.1 million.

24. The Advisory Committee was informed that the per-person cost of rations was
estimated at $6.20 per day, as compared with $6.34 per day in the budget submission
for MONUC for 2002/03. The Committee enquired as to why there had not been a
greater decrease in costs given the significant increase in the number of troops, but
no satisfactory answer was provided. In the opinion of the Committee, economies
of scale should have been achieved as a result of the increase in troop strength.

25. The estimate for contingent-owned equipment amounts to $67,230,400, of
which $34,470,300 is for reimbursement for self-sustainment costs (see A/58/381,
para. 6). The Advisory Committee was informed that the estimate for self-
sustainment took into account actual requirements of $26.3 million in respect of
troops deployed as at 31 August 2003 and included an estimated $8.2 million based
on the phased deployment of troops in respect of which a 25 per cent delayed
deployment factor had been applied.

26. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that of the 59 contingent
units in place, memorandums of understanding had been signed in respect of 38
units, 15 were in the process of being reviewed and/or signed by the troop-

__________________
1 This figure is based on a total of 7,940 troops. The increase in troop strength, in accordance

with Security Council resolution 1493 (2003), would in all likelihood entail a consequent
increase in the additional requirement related to the use of the contractor’s aircraft for the
distribution of rations.

A/58/447

contributing countries, 2 were being reviewed by the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, 3 were under negotiation and 1 was yet to be negotiated.

27. The estimate for reimbursement of major equipment amounts to $32,760,100,
an increase of $10,262,300 over the apportionment for 2002/03 (ibid.). The
Advisory Committee was informed that the increase was based on the actual troop
strength as at 31 August 2003 (7,296) and the phased deployment of an additional
2,744 troops from 1 September 2003 in respect of which a 25 per cent delayed
deployment factor had been applied. The Committee was given a deployment
schedule, which provided for the deployment of 8,605 military contingent personnel
as at 30 September and 9,875 as at 31 October. Upon enquiry as to whether the
Mission was on schedule with those deployments, the Committee was informed that
the deployed troop strength as at 30 September stood at 8,048 military contingent
personnel as compared with the anticipated strength of 8,605. The Committee was
also informed that it was expected that an additional 1,525 troops would arrive in
October and a further 45 in November, bringing the total to 9,618 as at 30 November
2003.

2. Civilian personnel

28. The estimated requirements for civilian personnel for 2003/04, which provide
for a total of 2,656 staff2 (938 international staff, 1,299 national staff and 419
United Nations Volunteers) amount to $109,576,900, an increase of $11,628,200
over the apportionment for 2002/03. In the last budget document examined by the
Advisory Committee, the estimate was $109,879,500 for a total of 2,435 staff (see
A/57/683/Add.1, summary). The current proposal represents an increase of 223
international staff, 537 national staff and 207 United Nations Volunteers over the
approved staffing for 2002/03 (see A/58/381, summary, and para. 8). The Committee
was informed that the estimates reflected the application of a 10 per cent vacancy
rate for national staff on board as at 31 August 2003 coupled with a 10 per cent
delayed recruitment factor for proposed additional national staff. For international
staff, the computation of salaries and related costs reflects a 20 per cent
vacancy/turnover factor in respect of staff on board as at 31 August 2003, as well as
a 30 per cent vacancy rate in respect of 331 staff (108 vacant posts plus the proposed
additional 223 posts). A 10 per cent vacancy factor has been applied in respect of
living allowances for United Nations Volunteers. The provision also reflects the
application of approved salary scales at the G-2, step 1, level for Local level
national staff and the entry-level scale for National Professional Officers. Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that those levels were used throughout the
Mission.

29. In its previous report on MONUC, the Advisory Committee noted the
traditionally high vacancy rates at the Mission and expressed its belief that the
vacancy factors proposed for 2003/04 were optimistic (see A/57/772/Add.10, annex,
paras. 29-31). As indicated in section V of the proposed budget, vacancy rates for
international staff as at 31 August 2003 had dropped to 15 per cent from the 38 per
cent average noted in the Committee’s report (ibid., para. 29). The Committee
trusts that efforts to increase recruitment and improve the vacancy situation
will continue.

A/58/447

Organizational structure of the Mission

30. The proposed staffing establishment and structure reflect the results of a
review of the Mission’s staffing requirements (see A/58/381, para. 8). The Advisory
Committee notes that many small units have been established with chiefs at the
P-4 level and above and very few staff for them to supervise. The
administrative structure as proposed tends to inflate grade structure and
exacerbate the duplication of functions.

31. The Advisory Committee questions, for example, the rationale for setting up a
separate Mandate Planning and Tracking Unit, which would appear to duplicate the
work of all the other substantive units of MONUC that deal with or should be fully
involved in mandate implementation, tracking and reporting. Furthermore, the
Mandate Planning and Tracking Unit and the Political Analysis and Reporting Unit
would appear to be responsible for more or less analogous functions. In order to
ensure that heads of divisions and units, especially at the Mission’s
headquarters and field stations, are fully accountable with regard to mandate
implementation, they should have distinct and identifiable functions.

32. As regards the Transition Support Unit in the Political Affairs Division, the
Advisory Committee points out that the entire Mission is charged with the function
of supporting the transition process in accordance with the mandate of the Security
Council contained in its resolution 1493 (2003). If, however, the Unit’s primary
responsibility is to support the International Committee in Support of the Transition,
then the grades and number of posts requested (1 D-1, 2 P-5, 3 P-4, 1 P-3, 2 P-2,
2 General Service (Other level), 1 national staff and 1 United Nations Volunteer)
would seem excessive. The functions ascribed to those posts appear to combine the
servicing of the Committee with substantive work done elsewhere in MONUC, such
as the preparation of policy recommendations based on political activities and
developments in civil society (see ibid., paras. 26 and 27). The Committee also
notes that the Political Affairs Division has two D-1 posts, one of which is
designated as Deputy Director of the Division and the other as the head of the
Transition Support Unit. The Committee sees no reason why the Deputy Director
could not have line functions over a Transition Support Unit headed by a P-5 staff
member, as is the case for the Political Analysis and Reporting Unit, which is the
other unit in the Division.

33. Furthermore, as can be seen from the proposed budget (ibid., para. 10 and
sect. VI), a number of mechanisms have been set up to provide for direct reporting
to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. The Advisory Committee is
concerned that this may weaken the role of the Deputy Special Representatives.
Furthermore, the busy travel schedules of the Special Representative and the Deputy
Special Representatives may render this arrangement difficult.

34. The proposed staffing of the Electoral Assistance Division provides for only
three Professional and one General Service staff (ibid., para. 35). Upon enquiry, the
Advisory Committee was informed that a team of electoral experts from the
Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs was currently
visiting MONUC to conduct the first phase of a two-phase electoral feasibility
study. The second phase is planned for the end of October. It is anticipated that the
report of the team will provide a draft outline on the electoral process. Elections are
expected to be held sometime during the second half of 2005. The Committee will



9
A/58/447

revert to the issue at such time as the Secretary-General submits recommendations
thereon to the Security Council and the General Assembly.

35. The Advisory Committee notes that staffing of the Division of Disarmament,
Demobilization, Repatriation, Resettlement and Reintegration is to consist of 21
international staff, 10 national staff and 12 United Nations Volunteers (ibid., paras.
37-39). On the basis of the information provided during its hearings with the Special
Representative and other representatives of the Secretary-General, as well as the
information contained in the estimates, the Committee concludes that neither the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, which is directed at
Congolese combatants, nor the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation,
resettlement and reintegration programme, which is to deal with foreign combatants
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is effectively operational. The estimates
are therefore based on the best guess of what could be required from the assessed
budget.

36. The proposed staffing of the Human Rights Section provides for 42
international staff, 31 national staff and 20 United Nations Volunteers (ibid., paras.
54-56). No mention is made in the proposed budget of cooperation and coordination
between this section and other United Nations entities dealing with human rights in
the region, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights and special rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights. The Advisory
Committee stresses the importance of such cooperation in order to avoid
duplication of work, and requests that information on this issue be included in
the next budget submission.

37. In view of its comments in paragraphs 30 to 36 above, the Advisory
Committee requests that the organizational structure be re-examined with a
view to streamlining processes and avoiding duplication. The Special
Representative of the Secretary-General informed the Committee that a review of
the senior structure of the Mission would be undertaken towards the end of the
financial period, including the requirement for two Deputy Special Representatives.
The Committee welcomes this information and requests that its observations in
the foregoing paragraphs be taken into account in this and in the broader
review it has requested.

Recruitment and delegation of authority

38. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Director of
Administration of MONUC had not been granted delegation of authority for the
recruitment of international staff. In this connection, the Committee recalls the
opinion it expressed in its general report on peacekeeping operations that missions
should have greater authority in the hiring and management of staff (A/57/772,
para. 84).

39. The Advisory Committee also recalls that it had been informed that when the
new staff selection system (Galaxy) was implemented, the time frame for filling
vacancies in peacekeeping operations would be reduced (ibid., para. 79). Upon
enquiry concerning progress in that regard, the Committee was informed that the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations was undertaking a pilot project together
with the Office of Human Resources Management to test the Galaxy system in the
peacekeeping context. The results to date have not been positive: the system is
proving to be very labour-intensive, as it has no means of screening applicants’



10

A/58/447

qualifications, and therefore many applications (in one case 400 applications for one
post) had to be reviewed to determine whether the applicant possessed the minimum
qualifications for the post. The Department is therefore currently using its own
separate system in which vacancies are posted on the Department’s web site, which
can be accessed through a link from the Galaxy system.

40. The Advisory Committee requests that progress made on the management
of vacancies and the timely recruitment and placement of mission personnel be
reported in the context of the next budget submission. The Committee will
review the implementation of the Galaxy system in peacekeeping operations
when it considers the proposed budget of the support account for peacekeeping
operations in February 2004.

3. Operational costs

41. The overall estimate for operational costs amounts to $298,531,100, an
increase of $3,709,600, or 1.3 per cent, over the apportionment for the 2002/03
period (A/58/381, sect. II.A.1). The detailed comments made by the Advisory
Committee on operational expenditures in its previous report on MONUC remain
valid (see A/57/772/Add.10, annex, paras. 35-58).

Air transportation

42. The major expenditure under this item, accounting for $166,115,800, or 56 per
cent of the estimated requirements, is for air operations. The estimate represents an
increase of $11,115,800, or 7.2 per cent, over the apportionment for the 2002/03
period. As indicated in the proposed budget, the main factor contributing to the
increase is the deployment of eight additional aircraft (1 fixed-wing aircraft and 7
helicopters), bringing the Mission’s fleet to 54 (25 fixed-wing aircraft and 29
helicopters) (see A/58/381, paras. 114 and 115). The requirement for additional
aircraft and the reconfiguration of the Mission’s fleet reflect the logistical support
requirements arising from the deployment of military personnel to the Ituri region
and Bunia and the deployment of additional civilian and military personnel to
locations in the east of the country, as well as limitations on the use of fixed-wing
cargo aircraft stemming from the insufficient length and/or quality of runways.
Additional costs were partially offset, however, by reductions under helicopters as a
result of the application of more realistic projections, based on experience, in
respect of the utilization of contractual and those under letter-of-assist
arrangements.

43. In its previous report on MONUC, the Advisory Committee commented in
detail on the Mission’s air operations and the airfield services contract
(see A/57/772/Add.10, annex, paras. 39-50). The Committee appreciates, in
particular, the attempt made by the Secretariat to justify the need for technical,
administrative and management staff with functions relating to air operations.

44. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with a progress report on
its recommendation that the Secretariat examine and clarify the various methods for
costing block hours, together with the relative merits of commercial hiring versus
letter-of-assist arrangements (see ibid., para. 43). The Committee was informed that
the current practice of contracting for the guaranteed flying hours was in compliance
with industry norms and that deviation from such norms entailed the risk of



11

A/58/447

attracting fewer carriers, narrowing the spectrum of available bidders, and that it
could expose the Organization to undesirable liabilities.

45. The Advisory Committee was informed that for 2003 the basis for evaluating
bids had changed, with awards going to carriers whose anticipated utilization
represented the lowest cost, rather than to the operator with the lowest price for the
maximum number of flying hours. The Committee was also informed that the
number of guaranteed flying hours was determined as realistically as possible to
avoid the risk of underutilization. In addition, the contracts provided for utilization
of guaranteed hours on an annual basis so that unused hours from one month would
be carried forward for use in subsequent months.

46. The Advisory Committee was further informed that the procurement of long-
term air transportation services through letters of assist had proven to be more
costly, as the Mission was obliged to provide accommodation and food for aircrews
that were not included in the cost of flying hours. Furthermore, commercial air
carriers operating under wet-lease contracts were responsible for aircraft
maintenance and insurance costs, as well as for crew rotation costs.

47. The Advisory Committee understands from the information provided to it
that the examination of the issues mentioned in paragraphs 44 to 46 above is
ongoing. The Committee requests that a further progress report be provided in
the context of the next budget submission.

48. The Advisory Committee questioned the operational necessity of having five
small aircraft, and was informed that adjustments to the air fleet would be made in
the near future. The Committee recommends that the Mission examine the
possibility of obtaining more versatile aircraft.

49. The Advisory Committee also requests that the next budget submission
contain information on progress achieved in increasing the capacity to move
personnel and material by land and river with a view to mitigating the
expanding use of costly air assets. The Committee has commented in previous
reports on the need for critical investment in this area (see A/56/887/Add.11,
para. 61, and A/56/845, para. 72). The Committee considers that such
investment should involve not only short-term mission requirements, but also
long-term investment by partners in the international community operating in
the mission area. The Committee stresses the importance of close cooperation
among all the United Nations entities in the region in this matter.

50. The Advisory Committee further requests that the Mission look into the
feasibility and cost-effectiveness of outsourcing medical evacuations and report
thereon in the context of the next budget submission for MONUC.

Ground transportation and information technology equipment

51. On the basis of additional information provided to the Advisory
Committee concerning ratios for vehicles and information technology
equipment, the Committee observes that, in view of the air transportation
available to the Mission, there is a need to examine more critically the
justification for continuing without modification the use of standard vehicle
ratios for MONUC. The Committee requests that this issue be addressed in the
next budget submission. Furthermore, the Committee questions the need for
one computer for every two national staff, given the fact that many national



12

A/58/447

staff are drivers or perform other functions that would not require electronic
data-processing equipment. The Committee also questions the provision of
computers and printers to contractual staff.

Travel and training

52. The Advisory Committee was provided with a breakdown of travel costs for
both training and non-training purposes. The bulk of the estimate for non-training
travel, which amounts to $3,062,027, is for travel between New York and the
Mission for planning and assessment purposes or for administrative or technical
support. In the opinion of the Committee, the need for much of this sort of
travel could be reduced through greater use of videoconferencing, especially
between the Mission and New York. The Committee has commented on this matter
in its general report on peacekeeping operations (see A/57/772, paras. 123 and 124).
The Committee also notes that in many instances more than one staff member is to
travel to the same meeting. The Committee believes that some savings could be
achieved by reducing the number of staff travelling to the same meeting.

53. The estimate for training amounts to $1,103,203, including $880,791 for
travel, and provides for the training of 1,278 staff. The Advisory Committee notes
that a number of training courses are scheduled in locations that are quite a distance
from mission headquarters in places such as Singapore and the United States of
America (e.g., California and Georgia). The Committee is of the view that nearer
training opportunities could be found, thus reducing the cost of travel-related
training. The Committee has commented extensively on training issues in the
peacekeeping operations in its general report (see A/57/772, paras. 127-133), as well
as in its report on the financing of MONUC (A/57/772/Add.10, annex, para. 58).
The Committee will follow up on this issue in the context of its next general report
on peacekeeping operations.

Regional and liaison offices

54. The Advisory Committee emphasizes the need to continue to review the
level of resources and the rationale for the number of regional and liaison
offices in the light of both developments and progress achieved in mandate
implementation.

IV. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee

55. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the
financing of MONUC for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 is indicated
in paragraph 123 of the proposed budget (A/58/381). In view of its comments in
paragraphs 12, 19, 24, 27, 37 and 51 to 53 above, the Advisory Committee
recommends appropriation of an amount of $59,038,300, in addition to the
amount of $582 million gross ($572,289,264 net) already appropriated and
assessed by the Assembly in its resolution 57/335 of 18 June 2003 for the
maintenance of the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 2003 to
30 June 2004. The Committee’s recommendation represents a reduction of $34
million, or approximately 5 per cent, with respect to the proposed
requirements. The Committee further recommends that the total amount
assessed for the period at this time should not exceed $582 million gross



13

A/58/447

($572,289,264 net). The Committee will review the situation when it examines
the estimates for the 2004/05 period. At that time, more information will be
available on the role of the Mission in the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programme and the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation,
resettlement and reintegration programme, as well as in the electoral process.
