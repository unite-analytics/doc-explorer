Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and
Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the
Secretary-General on safety and security of
humanitarian personnel and protection of United
Nations personnel (A/56/384 and Corr.1) and his report
on the revised budget estimates arising from section II,
Safety and security of United Nations personnel, of
General Assembly resolution 55/238 of 23 December
2000 (A/56/469 and Corr.1). During its consideration
of the reports, the Committee met with representatives
of the Secretary-General who provided additional
information and clarification.

2. The report on safety and security of humanitarian
personnel and protection of United Nations personnel
(A/56/384 and Corr.1) was submitted in response to
General Assembly resolution 55/175 of 19 December
2000, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-
General to submit to it at its fifty-sixth session a
comprehensive, updated report on the safety and
security situation of humanitarian personnel and
protection of United Nations personnel and on the
implementation of the resolution, including an account
of the measures taken by Governments and the United
Nations to prevent and respond to all individual
security incidents involving United Nations and

associated personnel. The report contains information
on threats against United Nations personnel and data
on those who had lost their lives since the submission
of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the
subject (A/55/494), as well as a description of the
measures taken to enhance the security of staff. Upon
enquiry, the Committee was informed that during the
period from 1 January 1992 to 31 October 2001, there
were a total of 204 civilian deaths. Of those, 50 were
international recruited staff. (See annex for a
breakdown by year, organization and type of incident.)
The Committee was also informed that during the
period from 1 January 1994 to 1 June 2001 there were
67 cases of hostage-taking or kidnapping involving 255
United Nations personnel. Of those, 183 were
international personnel (including civilian staff,
military observers and police monitors) and 72 were
locally recruited staff.

3. The report on the revised budget estimates arising
from section II of General Assembly resolution 55/238
(A/56/469 and Corr.1) is submitted in response to that
resolution, in which the Assembly requested the
Secretary-General to develop, in coordination with
executive heads of the United Nations specialized
agencies, funds and programmes, an effective



2
A/56/619

mechanism for cost-sharing arrangements for the
United Nations security management system, and to
submit proposals thereon to the Assembly at its fifty-
sixth session, through the Advisory Committee. The
Committee notes that the report outlines the evolution
of the current security management system, presents
proposals for strengthening the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator at Headquarters and the
security arrangements in the field, and includes related
revised cost estimates under section 30, Special
expenses, of the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/6 (sect. 30)), to be
apportioned among the participating organizations. The
report should therefore be read in conjunction with
section 30 of the proposed programme budget. The
Committee further notes that the Office of the United
Nations Security Coordinator coordinates and manages
the security system at 150 duty stations, of which 80
are considered to be at high risk. Moreover, 64 of those
were identified in the report (see also para. 8 below).

4. The Advisory Committee recalls that in its
resolution 55/238, the General Assembly decided,
pending submission of the report presently under
consideration, to establish under the regular budget,
effective 1 January 2001, 16 additional Professional
posts (2 P-5, 10 P-4 and 4 P-3) and 16 additional Local
level posts, both at Headquarters and in the field. The
Committee was informed that eight of the Professional
posts would be encumbered in November 2001, but
that those in the field had not yet been filled. The
Committee requests that the procedure to fill those
approved posts be expedited.

5. The Advisory Committee notes that the total
revised estimates for the Office of the United Nations
Security Coordinator for the biennium 2002-2003
proposed by the Secretary-General amount to
$53,366,400 before recosting (see A/56/469 and Corr.1,
para. 40 (d)). That amount, however, would be
apportioned among the participating organizations on
the basis of the principles and methodology set out in
the report (see para. 12 below). The United Nations
share of the costs would amount to $10,421,200 under
the regular budget, representing an increase of
$7,996,400 against the provision of $2,424,800
included in the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2002-2003 under section 30, Special
expenses (see ibid., table 3 and para. 39).

6. The revised estimated requirements related to
posts amount to $25,453,200 before recosting (ibid.,

table 1 and para. 25). The revised staffing table
includes a total of 338 posts, which would be managed
by the Office of the United Nations Security
Coordinator (ibid., table 2 and para. 25). Of the total,
331 posts are under the regular budget, to be funded on
a reimbursable basis (1 Assistant Secretary-General,
1 D-2, 5 P-5, 12 P-4/3 and 12 General Service at
Headquarters; and 100 security officers at the P-4/3
level and 200 Local level support staff in the field), and
7 are extrabudgetary posts funded from the support
account. The total proposed increase against current
approved staffing of the regular budget would amount
to 19 new posts (1 Assistant Secretary-General, 3 P-5,
2 P-4, 3 P-3 and 10 General Service), a reclassification
to the D-2 level for the post of the Deputy Security
Coordinator at Headquarters and 276 new posts in the
field (92 P-4/3 and 184 Local level). The proposed
increase under extrabudgetary posts would amount to
four new posts (2 P-4 and 2 General Service (Other
level)).

7. The Advisory Committee recalls that two new
posts (1 Assistant Secretary-General and 1 related
General Service (Other level)) were proposed in the
context of the proposed programme budget for 2002-
2003 (see A/56/6 (sect. 30), table A.30.6 and para.
A.30.2). The Committee, in paragraph X.19 of its first
report on the proposed programme budget for the
biennium 2002-2003,1 indicated that it would defer
consideration of the estimates for interorganizational
security measures until the related report, presently
under consideration, became available. In addition, the
establishment of four new posts under the support
account (2 P-4 and 2 General Service (Other level)),
mentioned in paragraph 6 above, was proposed for the
Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator in
the context of the programme budget implications of
draft resolution A/C.4/55/L.23, entitled
“Comprehensive review of the whole question of
United Nations peacekeeping operations in all their
aspects” (see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, paras. 30.2 (a) and
(b)). The Committee, in its report on implementation of
the reports of the Panel on United Nations Peace
Operations, indicated that it would revert to this issue
in the context of the related report on inter-
organizational security measures (see A/56/478, para.
96).

8. After careful consideration, the Advisory
Committee recommends acceptance of the
Secretary-General’s staffing proposals as contained



3
A/56/619

in his report (A/56/469 and Corr.1), including the
establishment of the post at the Assistant Secretary-
General level, in view of the need for a high-level
official to provide essential leadership in security
coordination and management, as well as the
reclassification to the D-2 level of the post of the
Deputy Security Coordinator. However, in view of
the 64 stations identified in the Secretary-General’s
proposals out of the 80 high-risk duty stations (see
para. 3 above), the Committee urges a review, in
future, to ensure complete coverage for all high-risk
duty stations.

9. In addition, a P-4 post was requested under
section 5, Peacekeeping operations, for a Security
Focal Point in the Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit of
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to act as
liaison with the Office of the United Nations Security
Coordinator on all aspects of security for peacekeeping
(see A/C.5/55/46/Add.1, para. 5.11). The Advisory
Committee, in its related report (A/56/478, para. 31),
indicated that the post and its financing should be
considered in the context of the examination of the
report presently under consideration. The Committee
is of the opinion that further efforts should be made
to clarify the relationship and interaction between
the Office of the United Nations Security
Coordinator and the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations. In view of the additional support
account posts mentioned in paragraph 7 above, the
Committee does not see the need to establish the
Security Focal Point post in the Peacekeeping Best
Practices Unit. Moreover, the Committee was
informed that the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs had seconded an individual to the
Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator and
that that arrangement had been very beneficial to the
work of both offices. The Committee is of the opinion
that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations should
give some thought to that approach instead.

10. The proposed organizational structure of the
Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator and
the disposition of the field security offices are
contained in annexes to the report (A/56/469 and
Corr.1, annexes I and II). In relation to the latter, the
Advisory Committee notes that some field offices
would be further strengthened by field security
advisers funded directly from the funds and
programmes in areas where they maintain a strong
presence or have requirements specific to their

functions. The Committee notes that there are an
estimated 63 such posts, which would be recruited and
managed by the agencies, funds and programmes, but
whose link to the Security Coordinator would be
through the designated resident coordinator in the field
(see ibid., annex III). The Committee trusts and
expects that this arrangement would not in any way
compromise the role of the Security Coordinator in
performing security functions on behalf of the
United Nations and the specialized agencies, funds
and programmes, especially insofar as central
professional management would help to ensure
consistency in the application of standards.

11. With respect to the issue of accountability (see
ibid., paras. 21-23), the Advisory Committee notes that
the matter has been discussed at the inter-agency level
on a preliminary basis and that agreement has been
reached on the broad outlines summarized in the report.
Furthermore, a joint working group is to meet in future
to develop the accountability standards in greater
detail. In view of the importance of a well-defined
hierarchical security structure in the field, the
Committee stresses that a prolonged discussion on
defining clear lines of responsibility and
accountability in ensuring the safety and security of
staff would be unacceptable; this issue must be
addressed expeditiously. The Committee therefore
requests the Secretary-General to report on
progress achieved in this regard at the fifty-seventh
session of the General Assembly.

12. Regarding the cost-sharing arrangements for the
new security management system (see ibid., paras. 32-
34), the Advisory Committee notes that the principles
and modalities were adopted within the framework of
the High-level Committee on Management at its second
session, on 10 and 11 September 2001, following
extensive consultations among the organizations of the
United Nations system. The cost-sharing formula is
based on data provided from a first census carried out
on 18 July 2001 in duty stations located in countries
that are not members of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development. The Committee notes
that the next census will take place in July 2003 in
order to collect data in respect of the cost-sharing
formula for the biennium 2004-2005.

13. The apportionment among the participating
organizations of the 2002-2003 revised estimates for
the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator
is shown in annex IV to the report. The Advisory



4
A/56/619

Committee notes that the United Nations share of
$11,987,100 relates to the safety and security of the
field staff of the Secretariat (6,604 staff on mission),
staff of the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia (98) and the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (887), hence the total number of
7,589 staff. Since the International Tribunals are
financed under their own assessed budgets, the total
amount of $11,987,100 is therefore split among the
United Nations ($10,991,500), the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ($193,200) and the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
($802,400).

14. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that,
if other entities participate, care must be taken to
ensure that they fully share in all identifiable direct
and indirect costs.

15. Moreover, in view of the importance of the
issue of coordination and management of staff
security and its centrality within the common
system, the Advisory Committee requests that the
present report be circulated among all the agencies,
funds and programmes of the United Nations. The
Committee stresses the importance of adhering to
the shared financial responsibility in the
coordinated management of the safety and security
of United Nations personnel. The Committee
further requests the Secretary-General to ensure
that the funds of the participating organizations are
transferred for this purpose as at 1 January of each
year, and that the share of the United Nations, as
approved by the General Assembly, is not exceeded
without prior approval of the Assembly, through the
Advisory Committee.

16. The Advisory Committee also requests the
Secretary-General to report on the experience
related to the implementation of the agreement,
including cash flow, and information on the staff
security costs from the participating agencies, funds
and programmes, thus allowing for a better
assessment of the security-related funds involved
and the benefits of the proposed agreement. That
information should be included in the next report
containing the proposals related to the percentage
share of each participating organization, which will
be based on data resulting from the next census,
mentioned in paragraph 12 above. In this
connection, the Committee urges participating
agencies to be fully transparent, particularly in the

context of their budget estimates, about their own
residual expenditures related to the security of
personnel in the field.
